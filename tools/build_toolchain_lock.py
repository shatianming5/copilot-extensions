"""Build-toolchain lock resolution for `tools/build_python_artifacts.py`.

Split out of that module to stay under `tools/check-module-size.py`'s
1,000-line cap for new/unbaselined files -- this is a component boundary,
not a reusability concern: every name here is still imported back into,
and re-exported by, `build_python_artifacts.py`, which remains the sole
public entry point and CLI. As this module itself later approached the
same cap, its OWN governed-feed index-discovery/trust concern was split
out again into `tools/governed_feed_trust.py`, re-imported and re-exported
here the same way -- every existing caller/test continues to see the same
names on this module.

Owns the Phase 2 Build hermeticity direction of the
`governed-python-artifact-promotion` effort
(`efforts/active/governed-python-artifact-promotion/README.md`): resolving
ONE pinned `setuptools`/`wheel` venv (`resolve_toolchain_lock`), reusable
unchanged across every wheel built in a run, verifying it only ever
installs from an affirmatively trusted, governed, non-public package feed
(`_governed_feed_configured`), and verifying a source's own `[build-
system].requires` floor is satisfied by the locked versions before a
`--no-build-isolation` build runs (`_assert_toolchain_satisfies_build_
requires`), since that build mode can never substitute a different
version to compensate.

      fails and the destination's provenance does NOT match. Rather than

    shares ONE toolchain lock across several plugins in one promotion run
    by passing the same ``venv_dir`` (``--toolchain-venv``) to every

    A venv at ``venv_dir`` that does NOT match (different index/python,

    """Fails closed unless the locked toolchain's exact `setuptools`/
    `wheel` versions satisfy every applicable constraint ``source_dir``
    itself declares in `[build-system].requires` -- e.g. a lagging
    governed feed resolving `setuptools` 83.x against a source that
    declares `setuptools>=84.0.0`. `--no-build-isolation` means `uv build`
    can never substitute a different version to satisfy this itself, so
    this must be checked before the build runs, not discovered as a
    mysterious build failure (or, worse, a successful build against a
    toolchain the source's own manifest says is insufficient).

    Also fails closed on any OTHER applicable requirement naming a
    package this toolchain does not lock at all (anything outside
    `setuptools`/`wheel`/`packaging`) -- `--no-build-isolation` means
    nothing installs it automatically, so silently treating "not one of
    the packages we lock" as "therefore satisfied" would let a genuinely
    unmet build dependency through undetected. Package names are compared
    PEP 503-canonicalized (case-insensitive, `-`/`_`/`.` runs collapsed)
    since `Requirement.name` preserves the source's own literal spelling
    (e.g. `Setuptools` must still match the locked `setuptools` entry).

    Requires the third-party `packaging` library, but never imports it in
    THIS (calling) process -- this repo has no root `pyproject.toml`/
    `requirements.txt` declaring it as a tool-level dependency, and a
    genuinely clean machine with just Python and `uv` installed would not
    have it importable here. Instead, the actual parsing/comparison runs
    as a subprocess THROUGH ``toolchain.venv_python`` itself, where
    `packaging` is guaranteed present: it is one of the packages this
    toolchain locks (`_LOCKED_TOOLCHAIN_PACKAGES`), installed from the
    same validated governed feed as `setuptools`/`wheel`. This also means
    the comparison runs under the SAME interpreter whose
    `marker_environment` it evaluates markers against."""
