"""Enforce a hard per-file line-count cap on source modules, with a
shrink-only baseline for pre-existing offenders.

A single module growing without bound (queue.py's ~7,200 lines is the
motivating case, spotted mid Phase-10 work on `review-automation-reliability`
#2357) is a componentization failure this repo had no automated guard
against. This check makes the standard real:

* **Any tracked, non-test ``*.py`` file** (test files are exempt --
  ``TESTING.md`` already directs "split by behavioral contract, not
  arbitrary line count," a different rule for a different failure mode)
  must not exceed :data:`CAP_LINES` lines.
* Because dozens of pre-existing files already exceed that cap (some by an
  order of magnitude), a **shrink-only baseline**
  (``tools/module-size-baseline.json``) grandfathers each one in at its
  *current* line count as a temporary ceiling. The guard still fails if any
  baselined file grows even one line further, or if any non-baselined file
  newly crosses :data:`CAP_LINES` -- so the guard has real teeth against
  *new* growth from day one, without requiring an immediate rewrite of
  every offender. Shrinking a file below its baselined ceiling is always
  allowed and never itself a failure.

Widening a file's ceiling is a **manual, reviewed edit** to the baseline
JSON in the ordinary case, never something an ordinary PR run of this script
does automatically -- growth past the grandfathered size must be a
conscious, visible decision, not a silent side effect of running a refresh.
Plain ``--refresh-baseline`` only ever *lowers* an existing entry (when a
file has shrunk) or *removes* one entirely (when a file has shrunk to or
below the cap); it never raises an entry, even if a file has grown -- that
case is a guard failure to fix, not baseline noise to absorb.

The one exception is the opt-in ``--allow-widen`` flag:
concurrent-agent development can legitimately grow several already-baselined
files within the same short window (a shared module touched by parallel,
unrelated PRs), which then forces every subsequent PR -- even ones that never
touched the grown file -- to carry an unrelated manual baseline-widening
diff just to pass CI. ``--refresh-baseline --allow-widen`` additionally
*raises* a ceiling up to a file's current size when it is over its recorded
ceiling. This is still never silent: it is restricted by convention (see
``.github/workflows/module-size-baseline-widen.yml``) to a scheduled/
post-merge run directly against ``main`` after the fact, producing its own
reviewable PR -- **never** something a PR branch's own CI run does to its
own diff, which would let a PR silently launder its own growth past review.

**PR-time scoping (``--changed-since REF``).** ``--allow-widen`` closes the
gap *after* it opens, but there is still a window between another PR's merge
growing a shared file past its ceiling and the widen job's own PR landing --
during which *every* PR's ordinary (non-``--allow-widen``) CI run sees the
guard fail, even one that never touched the grown file (a PR is blamed for
growth it did not cause and cannot fix without an unrelated, out-of-scope
diff). ``--changed-since REF`` scopes enforcement to exactly the files this
invocation's own diff touches (``git diff --name-only REF...HEAD``, i.e.
relative to the merge-base with ``REF`` -- unaffected by how far ``REF``'s
branch has since moved). A file this PR never touched is fully exempt from
`check()` here regardless of its current size; a file it does touch is still
held to the ordinary cap/ceiling rule, unchanged. This flag only ever
*narrows* which files `check()` considers -- it never changes the pass/fail
rule for a file it does consider, and it is meaningless (and rejected) with
``--refresh-baseline``, whose whole job is auditing the *entire* tree's
baseline, never a PR's own diff scope.

**Exception: a diff that touches the baseline JSON itself also checks every
baseline entry the diff itself added, changed, or removed** -- in addition
to the files its own ``*.py`` diff touches -- rather than scoping purely by
file list. The baseline records the ceiling invariant for the whole tree, so
scoping around a baseline edit by file list alone could let a lowered/
removed ceiling silently pass here (nothing else in the diff touched the
now-over-ceiling file) only to fail the very next full-tree sweep on
``main``. This still never falls back to a fully unscoped sweep, though: a
file whose own source *and* baseline entry this diff never touches is
unrelated organic drift on trunk (the responsibility of a scheduled
sweep/decomposer, per Phase 2, not this PR) -- exactly the unfair-
attribution failure mode this flag exists to prevent, and a baseline-
touching PR would otherwise be blamed for it every single time it lowers
even one unrelated entry's ceiling.
