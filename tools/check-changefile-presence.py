"""Require a pending changefile (``tools/changefile.py``) for every plugin a
PR touches -- the changefile-based replacement for
``check-version-bump.py``'s manual three-file version bump, once a PR
targets ``dev`` under the dev-branch-release-pipeline design
(ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3336).

Reuses ``check-version-bump.py``'s plugin-diff detection (which plugin(s) a
diff touches, including the shared-``libs/<lib>``-fans-out-to-every-consumer
rule) via a direct file load -- its filename has a hyphen, so it can't be a
normal ``import`` -- rather than duplicating that logic.

**Wired into CI** (`ci.yml`'s `guards + lint` job, `PR-into-dev only`) since
the dev-branch-release-pipeline cutover; the paragraph below describing it
as not-yet-wired is historical and predates that cutover.

Usage::

    python tools/check-changefile-presence.py                 # diff vs origin/dev
    python tools/check-changefile-presence.py --base <sha>     # diff vs an explicit base

    Deliberately narrower than "every changefile currently sitting in the

    PRs routinely leave their own still-pending changefiles in place while
    they wait for the next promotion. A PR whose own changefile omits a
    plugin it touches can still pass if that plugin happens to already have
    an unrelated pending changefile from a DIFFERENT PR -- coincidental
    coverage, not this PR's own. If that unrelated changefile is consumed by
    a promotion before this PR merges, the plugin ships this PR's content
    with no bump at all: exactly the silent stale-deploy failure this whole
    guard exists to prevent (dotfiles #1025), just one level removed
    (PR #4942 review).

    Restricted to TOP-LEVEL ``.changefiles/*.json`` paths -- the only shape
    ``changefile.read_changefiles()`` itself ever reads (it globs
    ``.changefiles/*.json`` non-recursively). Reducing to a bare basename
    without that restriction let an added nested path (e.g.
    ``.changefiles/archive/pending.json``) coincidentally match an existing,
    unrelated TOP-LEVEL file of the same name (``.changefiles/pending.json``)
    that ``read_changefiles()`` would actually consume -- passing a PR whose
