"""Scheduled safety-net sweep for stale merged-PR branches.

This automates the exact manual technique used for a one-time cleanup of
3000+ accumulated branches on `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions` (see the
`branch-hygiene` effort): cross-reference every merged pull request's head
branch against the branches that still physically exist on `origin`, and
delete the ones whose PR is already merged.

Why this still matters even after `delete_branch_on_merge` is enabled on the
repo and `agent-worktrees`' own merge tooling passes `--delete-branch` by
default: both of those only clean up *going forward*, for merges that go
through those exact paths. This sweep is the safety net for everything else
-- a PR merged through GitHub's own UI before the setting was retroactively
enabled, an external tool/bot that never requested branch deletion, or a
pre-existing backlog on any other repo this pattern gets adopted in.

Deliberately conservative, mirroring `tools/module-health-watchdog.py`'s own
convention:

- Only treats a branch as deletable when its **single most recent** PR
  record (open, closed, or merged -- see ``_latest_pr_per_branch``) is a
  MERGED one; an open or closed-unmerged PR's head branch is never treated
  as deletable, and that veto wins even over a coincidentally-matching OID
  from some older, now-superseded merge (reused/reopened branch names).
- A branch name alone is never a stable identity: a name can be deleted and
  recreated, force-pushed with new commits, picked up by a brand-new open
  PR, or (for a same-named branch on a fork) never have belonged to this
  repository at all. Planning only proposes a branch whose **same-repo,
  MERGED** PR's recorded head commit OID still matches that branch's
  *current* commit OID on `origin` as of the planning snapshot. The actual
  deletion then performs its own atomic, server-side compare-and-delete via
  `git push --force-with-lease=<ref>:<expected-oid>` -- not a separate
  check-then-act GET+DELETE, which a transient GET failure or a race
  between the two calls could silently bypass (fail open). A rejected lease
  (the branch moved between planning and deleting) is treated as a safe
  skip ONLY when it is the lease's own stale-info rejection -- any other
  push rejection (a protected-branch hook declining the delete, a
  permission error, etc.) is a real failure. A compare-and-delete lease
  alone cannot catch a new PR opened against an already-planned-deletable
  branch, since opening a PR never changes that branch's OID -- the actual
  deletion also re-checks live, immediately before each delete, whether a
  same-repository OPEN PR now has that branch as its head (see
  `_has_open_pr`), and skips if so. A fork-originated PR's `headRefName`
  never denotes a branch on this repo at all and is excluded entirely (both
  from deletion and from counting toward "has any PR record" below). When
  a branch name has been reused across multiple PR records
  over time (merged, then closed unmerged, then reopened, etc.), the
  **single most recent** one (by event time) determines both whether the
  branch is deletable at all and, if so, the expected OID -- never an
  arbitrary record.
- `--execute` refuses to push a deletion through a local git remote that
  doesn't resolve to the exact `--repo` host+path (`github.com` plus an
  exact owner/repo match, not a mere suffix), and scrubs ambient
  `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`/etc. environment variables before every git
  call so an inherited repository-selection variable can't silently
  redirect it.
- Never touches a protected branch (the repo's configured default branch,
  plus `dev` for this repo's own `main`+`dev` pair -- see
  ``DEFAULT_PROTECTED_EXTRA``).
- Never auto-deletes a branch with **no PR record at all** (open, closed, or
  merged) that merely looks disposable by naming convention
  (``worktree/*``, ``feature/*``, ``pr/*``) -- those need per-case human/agent
  judgment (the one-time sweep found genuinely live, minutes-old branches
  among them). Instead it opens/updates a single tracking issue listing them
  for triage, exactly as cautious as leaving them alone, and closes that
  same issue again once a later run finds nothing left to flag -- so it
  never lingers with a stale branch list.
- Refuses to classify anything -- deletable or flagged -- from a PR-history
  query it cannot prove is complete: a branch absent from a truncated
  ``gh pr list`` result is indistinguishable from a branch with no PR record
  at all, and a merged PR outside a truncated window would be silently
  skipped as "not mergeable" too. See ``_pull_requests`` below.
- Defaults to a dry run; nothing is deleted or filed without ``--execute``.

Usage::

    python tools/sweep_stale_branches.py                  # dry run, prints the plan
    python tools/sweep_stale_branches.py --execute         # actually delete + file
    python tools/sweep_stale_branches.py --repo owner/name # override for local testing

Exit code is 0 for a successful sweep (including a dry run, and including a
run that found nothing to do); nonzero when `--execute` was asked to
actually act and a branch deletion or the tracking-issue file/update itself
failed, or when the PR-history/branch-list queries could not be proven
complete -- so a scheduled run's own CI goes red instead of silently
reporting success while leaving work undone or acting on partial data.
