"""Hard-block guard: this repo's own tree must never carry an agent-machines
consuming-side package.

``agent-machines`` (the plugin this repo ships) is a *platform*: it defines
the ``.copilot-extensions/agent-machines/`` requirement-package convention
(and the legacy ``.agent-machines/`` / ``.github/machine-state/`` locations
it still reads) for a **consuming** repo to declare its own desired machine
state -- gated to specific machines, sometimes down to a
``machines/<machine>/`` folder keyed by the literal machine name. That
content belongs exclusively in the repo that *consumes* the plugin (e.g. an
operator's own private control repo), never in copilot-extensions itself:
this repo is public, a package here would publish a real machine
name/topology to the world, and -- structurally -- copilot-extensions has
no machine of its own to converge; it only ships the mechanism.

Confirmed live (2026-09-26): an agent authoring a private facility's
fleet-update opt-in package almost committed it straight into
copilot-extensions' ``.copilot-extensions/agent-machines/machines/<machine>/``
before the PR-open tooling's own branch-name privacy check caught the leak
and the operator redirected the package into their private control repo
instead. This guard makes that redirection the enforced default for every
future contributor, not a caught-by-luck save -- see the
``agent-machines-setup`` skill's own "Author a requirement package"
section, which now states the same rule.

Whole-tree, not diff-scoped: this is a structural repo-shape invariant (like
``check-module-size.py``), not a content-diff privacy scan -- there is
never a legitimate reason for any of these paths to exist here, pre-existing
or newly added, so a full-tree check costs nothing (today: zero matches)
and can never regress silently.

Exit code 0 = no consuming-side package paths present, 1 = found one.
