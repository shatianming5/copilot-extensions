"""Build promotion-time, content-addressed Python artifacts for one plugin:
its own wheel plus a wheel for every vendored `libs/<lib>` dependency it
needs, discovered recursively in BOTH shapes a consumer's `pyproject.toml`
can carry: the dev-branch live, escaping `uv`-editable canonical-reference
form (`uv_editable_ref.find_uv_editable_refs`) and an ordinary, non-escaping
in-tree vendored copy (`find_in_tree_lib_sources`) -- the form every
reference becomes once `materialize_main.py` has run, which is the real
state this tool actually builds against during promotion. This is Phase 2
of the `governed-python-artifact-promotion` effort
(`efforts/active/governed-python-artifact-promotion/README.md`) -- the first
implementation slice: wheel + manifest generation. Publication (a GitHub
Release), attestation (Sigstore/OIDC), and promotion-pipeline wiring are
separate, later slices; this script only builds artifacts and writes a
manifest describing them, and does not publish or sign anything.

**Artifact identity.** Per the effort's resolved Open Design Questions, an
artifact set's identity folds together:

* a **payload hash** -- a content hash of the plugin's own directory plus
  every vendored lib directory it needs, walked directly on disk (not
  `git HEAD`: promotion builds from a scratch tree already mutated by
  version bumps and materialization, so the bytes actually fed to the
  build can differ from `HEAD` even though both describe "this commit" --
  hashing the working tree is the only way the identity matches what was
  actually built);
* the **platform/python tags** read directly off the built wheels'
  filenames (the canonical, self-describing source for this -- never
  guessed from the running interpreter), with a conflicting pair of
  non-universal tags across the wheel set treated as a hard failure rather
  than resolved by whichever wheel happened to be built first;
* the **build-tool closure** actually used -- a single, pre-resolved
  ``setuptools``/``wheel`` version pair, pinned into one dedicated venv
  (``resolve_toolchain_lock``) BEFORE any wheel is built and reused,
  unchanged, across every wheel in one invocation (and, when a caller
  passes the same ``--toolchain-venv`` across several invocations, across
  a whole promotion run). Every wheel is built with ``uv build --wheel
  --no-build-isolation`` against that one locked venv rather than `uv`'s
  normal per-wheel isolated PEP 517 build, which would otherwise silently
  resolve "whatever satisfies pyproject.toml's open-floor `requires`
  today" -- unrecorded and unreproducible run-to-run. Each built wheel's
  own `dist-info/WHEEL` ``Generator:`` line is read back and verified to
  match the locked toolchain exactly; a mismatch (or a missing
  `Generator:` line) fails the build closed rather than silently recording
  an unknown or drifted toolchain; and
* every **wheel's own filename and digest** -- two artifact sets with the
  same source/tags/toolchain but byte-different wheels must never collide
  on the same `artifact_id`.

**Manifest schema note (version 2):** ``build_toolchain`` is a structured
record (``{"packages": {"setuptools": "...", "wheel": "...", "packaging":
"..."}, "lock_id": "sha256:..."}``) describing the one locked toolchain
every wheel in the set was built against -- not schema version 1's ad hoc
list of per-wheel ``Generator:`` strings gathered after the fact.
``packaging`` is locked alongside ``setuptools``/``wheel`` so this tool's
own ``[build-system].requires`` verification can run inside the locked,
governed-feed-sourced venv rather than depending on ``packaging`` being
importable in whatever process runs this tool.

Usage::

    python tools/build_python_artifacts.py agent-bridge --out-dir /tmp/dist

    # Share one locked toolchain across several plugins in one promotion
    # run by passing the SAME --toolchain-venv to each invocation:
    python tools/build_python_artifacts.py agent-bridge --out-dir /tmp/dist \\
        --toolchain-venv /tmp/toolchain-venv
    python tools/build_python_artifacts.py agent-worktrees --out-dir /tmp/dist \\
        --toolchain-venv /tmp/toolchain-venv
