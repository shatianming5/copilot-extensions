"""Report (never fix) a red `dev` validation run.

Phase 1 of the promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent effort
(`efforts/active/promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent/README.md`):
`validate-and-promote.yml`'s `report-failure` job invokes this after any of
`full`/`worktree-manager`/`guards-full-sweep` fails on a genuine `dev`
commit. It finds the failed job(s) in the *current* run, extracts a compact
failure signature (the failing pytest node id when one is parseable, else a
whole-job signature keyed off the log tail), dedupes against an already-open
tracking issue via a hidden `Signature: <hash>` anchor line (mirroring
`tools/module-health-watchdog.py`'s own `Module: <path>` anchor pattern), and
either files a new issue or -- rate-limited -- comments on the existing one.

This script **never attempts a fix**. It only ever reports or files, exactly
like `module-health-watchdog.py`; Phase 2 (an actual fix-attempt mechanism)
is separate, gated work the effort's own Plan blocks behind a vision
reconciliation this script does not touch.

Usage::

    python tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py --run-id 123 --sha abc123            # dry run, prints only
    python tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py --run-id 123 --sha abc123 --file-issue  # actually file/comment (needs gh + GH_TOKEN)
    python tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py --run-id 123 --sha abc123 --file-issue --rate-limit-hours 12

Exit code is 0 for detection/reporting and a successful (or skipped/deduped)
filing; nonzero when `--file-issue` was asked to actually file/comment and
either the `gh` call itself failed, or the run's own job list/logs could
not even be fetched (both mean the watchdog detected nothing this run --
reporting success there would silently mask a broken watchdog). Dry-run
mode (no `--file-issue`) always exits 0 -- mirroring `module-health-
watchdog.py`'s own contract so a scheduled/CI run never reports success
while silently doing nothing.
