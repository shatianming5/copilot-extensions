"""Static structural tests for the --block-public-feeds / -BlockPublicFeeds
wiring in run.sh / run.ps1 (private-downstream-repo feed-neutral-build-config effort,
#6755 Phase 3).

Docker is not assumed to be available wherever these tests run, so these are
deliberately structural (text-based) checks rather than a live container run:
they confirm the flag is wired to null-route the same four public feed
hostnames, consistently, in both host wrappers. A live end-to-end proof (run
the harness with --block-public-feeds and no substitute feed, confirm the
existing toolchain-uv jam fires; then with --uv-index set, confirm success)
is documented as an outstanding manual/CI step in the effort README -- it
needs an actual Docker host and, for the "succeeds under substitute" half, a
real internal-feed-shaped endpoint.
