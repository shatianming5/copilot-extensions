# tmux-drive.sh -- first-class helper API for driving a HEADED (real
# interactive-TTY) `copilot` session inside a clean-room scenario via tmux +
# send-keys, for cases where `-p`/`--acp` do not exercise the code path under
# test.
#
# Why this exists: investigating a known Copilot CLI extension-connection-clash issue (private, not publicly linked) (the
# context-handoff extension-connection clash) established that `copilot -p`
# (headless mode) never launches extensions at all -- only skills load
# headlessly. Extensions (the JS runtime-hosted kind that register tools,
# like context-handoff) only activate under a REAL interactive session.
# `--acp` was the other candidate automation surface, but as of this writing
# no clean-room-usable CLI-mode agent-bridge driver exists yet for it (a
# separate in-flight effort). tmux + `-i/--interactive` + send-keys is the
# durable, present-day way to drive and observe a real headed session from a
# scenario.sh, so this is factored out as shared infrastructure rather than
# a one-off hack in a single scenario -- any future scenario that needs a
# genuinely interactive session (not just a headless prompt/response) should
# use this instead of re-deriving its own tmux incantations.
#
# IMPORTANT -- also pass `--experimental` to the driven `copilot` invocation
# whenever the scenario cares about the extension-host mechanism specifically:
# without it, `/env` reports "Extensions: No extensions loaded" even when a
# plugin's skills/hooks load fine -- the JS extension-host component is
# gated behind that flag entirely, independent of headed vs. headless mode.
# This helper does not add the flag automatically (callers that only need a
# headed session for some OTHER reason should not be forced into
# experimental-features territory), but every extension-focused scenario
# built on this file should include it explicitly, as
# context-handoff-connection-race does.

# Public helper API:

#                                        (best-effort; returns 1 if it
#                                        cannot be installed, e.g. no network)
#   cr_tmux_start <session> <cwd> <prompt> [extra copilot args...]
#                                     -- kill any stale session of the same
#                                        name, then start a detached tmux
#                                        session in <cwd> running
#                                        `copilot -i <prompt> <extra args...>`;
#                                        auto-dismisses the one-time "Confirm
#                                        folder trust" prompt every headed
#                                        session hits against a not-yet-
#                                        trusted cwd (accepts the default
#                                        "Yes", does NOT persist trust)

#                                        keeps a bounded history buffer, so
#                                        long sessions may still truncate --
#                                        prefer polling early/often over
#                                        capturing once at the end)
#   cr_tmux_wait_for <session> <pattern> [timeout_s]
#                                     -- poll cr_tmux_capture (grep -E

#                                        <timeout_s> (default 30) elapses;
#                                        returns 1 on timeout, leaving the
#                                        session running for post-mortem

#                                        (best-effort cleanup, never blocks
