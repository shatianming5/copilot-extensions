# Tier-E execution — design

> **What this is:** the concrete **execution design** for Tier-E (agent-driven,
> eval) clean-room runs — the layer that turns *"drop Copilot on a fresh box and
> have it read our docs and act"* into a repeatable, judged PASS/FAIL. It fills
> the gap between the Tier-E *concept* (already defined in
> [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §1, the [vision](../../visions/clean-room-validation/README.md),
> and the [`clean-room-judge`](../../plugins/copilot-extensions-harness/agents/clean-room-judge.agent.md)
> agent) and a working implementation. **Status: beachhead BUILT** — the runner
> `-Mode eval` path, the `lib/literal-mode.md` fixture, and the reference
> `agent-vault-eval` scenario are implemented and validated end-to-end (drive →
> capture → `clean-room-judge` verdict). The **extreme** whole-harness F1-E/F3-E
> variant remains future work (Phase 6). See the phased plan in §11.
>
> Tier P (programmatic) runs today (17 scenarios). Tier E's pieces — the
> `bridge-register` transport, the judge agent, the literal-mode principle — are
> now wired together by an execution path (`-Mode eval`) with one public reference
> eval scenario. This document is the design of record for that layer.

## 1. What Tier-E execution must serve

Two operator-facing variants of the same machinery, from the original ask:

- **Less-extreme (per-plugin doc-audit).** Start from a **partial harness** (e.g.
  a fresh box with one plugin installed), give Copilot a natural-language prompt
  — *"set up agent-vault for use"* / *"using agent-vault, list my vault entries"*
  — and judge whether it could **parse the plugin's docs and satisfy its needs**
  one-shot. This is **F2-E** (does a solo plugin's docs let a fresh agent stand it
  up / drive it), and the doc-audit form of **F1-E**.
- **Extreme (whole-harness from bare).** Start from an **empty box** (Copilot +
  auth only), point Copilot at the harness-setup skill, say *"set this up"*, and
  judge whether it produces a **validly-functional harness**. This is **F1-E**
  (suite self-assembly) escalating to **F3-E / turn-key assembly acceptance** (the
  vision's ultimate gate: fresh harness + empty knowledge repo completes a real
  task with zero manual setup).

Both are the **same pipeline** (§3) pointed at a different *starting state* and
*prompt*. The design makes the starting state and prompt the two scenario knobs so
one runner serves the whole spectrum.

> **Why this tier exists:** Tier P proves the *CLI surfaces* work; it cannot prove
> the **docs are followable by an agent**. A plugin can pass every Tier-P assertion
> and still be un-set-up-able because its SKILL/README doesn't tell an agent what
> it needs. Tier E is the only tier that audits the docs as *instructions to an
> agent*.

## 2. The non-negotiable: literal mode (why a naive eval lies)

A capable model will **hammer** at a broken or under-documented setup —
improvising, hand-installing missing pieces, retrying — and *reach a working end
state anyway*. That **masks the very gap under test** and turns a doc failure into
a green run. Every Tier-E run therefore puts the driven Copilot in a
**take-it-literally-or-bust** posture (see ARCHITECTURE.md §1 and the judge agent):

- Do **exactly** the named step; do **not** diagnose, repair, or work around.
- On the **first** obstacle, **stop and report verbatim** what blocked you.
- Treat the **absence** of an explicit "ready" signal as **not set up**, never
  "probably fine."

This is injected as **run-time instructions to the driven agent** (§6), never
baked into the plugins, and the [`clean-room-judge`](../../plugins/copilot-extensions-harness/agents/clean-room-judge.agent.md)
scores under the same rule: **a pass that depended on improvised self-repair is a
FALSE-PASS → FAIL**, and the finding is a *scenario/plugin* defect.

## 3. The end-to-end run loop

```

1. **Build/start the box** — reuse today's `run.ps1`/`run.sh` build + auth-inject +
   persistent named container (`base` or `pristine` per the manifest).
2. **Establish the starting state** — run the scenario's `setup.sh` (partial
   harness): enable the marketplace, install the declared plugin subset, apply any
   fixtures (governed `pip.conf`, uv-index). This is *deterministic setup*, not the
   thing under test — it uses the same `lib/` helpers as a Tier-P scenario, but its
   phases only **arrange the box**, they do not assert the eval. For the **extreme**
   variant this is a near-no-op (bare box; the agent does the setup).
3. **Register the box as a bridge agent** — `bridge_register.py register` (the
   existing `command`-type provider agent: `docker exec -i cr-<img> bash -lc
   "copilot --acp --stdio --allow-all --experimental"`), TTL-scoped.
4. **Seed the prompt** — send the **literal-mode framing** (§6) followed by the
   scenario's **stated-purpose prose** to the agent (`agent-bridge send <name>
   "<framing>\n\n<prompt>"`). One turn; the agent acts inside the box against the
   real docs/skills.
5. **Capture the transcript + report** — persist what the agent *did* (its reply,
   tool calls, and any files it touched) to the results dir as the judge's primary
   evidence (§7).
6. **Optional programmatic post-check** — an OPTIONAL `post_check.sh` runs the
   plugin's real CLI to capture *ground-truth* evidence of whether the box ended up
   set up (e.g. `agent-vault which` exits 0, the binstub is on PATH). This gives the
   judge an objective anchor beside the transcript; it never *substitutes* for the
   literal-mode judgment (the agent self-healing to a good end state is still a
   FALSE-PASS).
7. **Assemble the judge packet** — the `validating-in-clean-room` skill gathers
   {`manifest.json` expected outcome + stated-purpose prose, `cr-report.json`,
   `cr-logs/`, the transcript, the literal-mode instruction set} (exactly the
   inputs the judge agent documents).
8. **Judge → record** — hand the packet to `clean-room-judge`; record its
   structured verdict into `cr-eval.json` (§7). The runner does not itself decide
   PASS/FAIL for an eval — the judge does.

## 4. The Tier-E scenario contract

Extends the §4 scenario contract in ARCHITECTURE.md. A Tier-E scenario directory:

```
<scenario>/
├── manifest.json     # tier:"E"; image; prereqs; starting_state ref; prompt; expected_outcome; runs
├── setup.sh          # establish the STARTING STATE (partial harness). Sources lib/; setup-only phases.
├── prompt.md         # (optional) the stated-purpose prose seed, if not inline in manifest
├── expected.md       # (optional) the judge rubric / ordered intended steps, if not inline
├── post_check.sh     # (optional) programmatic ground-truth evidence AFTER the agent turn
└── fixtures/         # optional seed files (governed pip.conf, uv-index unjam, a seeded .kdbx, …)
```

`manifest.json` (Tier-E fields, on top of the shared ones):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "agent-vault-eval",
  "tier": "E",
  "family": "F2",                      // F1 | F2 | F3

  },

  },

  "expected_outcome": {
    "steps": [
      "Discover agent-vault's setup/usage docs (its SKILL/README).",
      "Follow the documented first-use path (the binstub self-provisions the runtime).",

  },

  "runs": { "count": 1, "aggregate": "unanimous", "per_turn_timeout_s": 900, "max_credits": 5 },

  // Optional programmatic anchor after the agent turn.
  "post_check": "post_check.sh"
}
```

`eval.model` is optional. When present, both runners pass it to
`agent-bridge create --model`, which applies the advertised ACP model
configuration for that fresh session and records `requested_model` in
`eval-run.json`. A transcript that reports a model fallback is transport-invalid
evidence, not proof of a second-model replication.

Each drive also passes `agent-bridge create --session-id-file` and resolves
`usage_model` plus structured results only from that exact create-owned session.
Missing, malformed, absent, or duplicate session provenance is transport
`INVALID`; the runner never chooses the newest same-agent session from a broad
listing.

The optional invalid-evidence pair names a scenario-local Python writer and a
contained results-relative output. On setup-gate, ACP registration,
fingerprinting, driver-exit, timeout, or model-selection failure, the runner or
post-check can invoke that writer to persist the scenario's zero-turn `INVALID`
record instead of losing the failed cell.

Each running clean-room container has its own provider registration record,
bound to that container's immutable Docker ID. Concurrent evaluations therefore
keep their own ACP command and resolved workspace folder even though they share
the `cleanroom:` namespace manifest. The manifest invokes a stable provider copy
under agent-bridge state rather than a disposable source-worktree path. Resolve
and readiness checks require the same running container ID and a still-existing
ACP cwd. Normal unregister compares the caller-retained immutable ID; explicit
stale cleanup only removes a record after its recorded ID is gone. Cleanup
failures are reported in `eval-run.json` instead of discarding an otherwise
complete judge packet.

**Design choices:**

- **Setup and eval are separated.** `setup.sh` only *arranges* the box (it may use
  `phase`/`pass`/`info` for its own legibility, but its passes are **setup
  telemetry, not the verdict**). This keeps "what we pre-installed" auditable and
  reusable, and prevents a scenario author from accidentally asserting the eval
  programmatically (that would be Tier P).
- **The prompt is the stated purpose, verbatim-ish.** It should read like a real
  user request and lean on *the plugin's own docs* ("do what its documentation
  says"), so the run audits the docs, not a bespoke script.
- **`expected_outcome` is a rubric, not an assertion.** It gives the judge the
  intended ordered path, the affirmative-ready signal to require, and the explicit
  **false-pass tripwires** (self-heals that must fail the run).
- **`family` selects the question** (F1/F2/F3 per ARCHITECTURE §1) and, for the
  extreme variant, `starting_state.setup` shrinks toward empty.

## 5. Two worked scenarios (the beachhead + the north star)

- **`agent-vault-eval` (F2-E, the beachhead).** Starting state: `agent-vault`
  installed solo, no `.kdbx`. Prompt: *"set up agent-vault and list my vault
  entries, following its docs."* A correct **literal** run either reaches an
  affirmative ready/locked state **or stops and reports the missing `.kdbx`
  prerequisite** — both are PASS. A run where the agent *hand-creates a vault* to
  "get it working" is a **FALSE-PASS** (the docs failed to state the prereq, or the
  plugin didn't fail-closed). This directly audits the agent-vault SKILL/README as
  *instructions to an agent* — the cheapest, most falsifying first eval.
- **`context-handoff-eval` (F1-E efficiency witness).** Starting state: a
  synthetic worktree with a pending high-fidelity handoff and a predecessor
  head. The compact seed is the only initial prompt. The run records seed
  characters/estimated tokens, turns and consume-tool evidence to acknowledgement,
  takeover and retire-or-preserve timing, payload hashes/canary visibility, and
  the prompt-before-session candidate/acknowledgement ordering.
- **`harness-from-bare` (F1-E → F3-E, the north star).** Starting state: bare box
  (Copilot + auth). Prompt: *"set up this harness"* pointed at the harness-setup
  skill. Judge whether the suite self-assembles (binstubs, projects, worktrees,
  bridge) with **zero manual steps**, escalating to the vision's **turn-key
  assembly acceptance** (bind an empty knowledge repo; complete a real task). This
  one is **name-ful** (it names a specific harness/skill) and therefore **homes
  downstream** (ARCHITECTURE §6), mounted via `-Scenario <dir>`.

## 6. Literal-mode fixture (substrate-owned, reusable)

A single shared **constrained-agent instruction block** lives in the rig substrate
— proposed `lib/literal-mode.md` — and is injected as the **framing prefix** of the
seed turn (before the scenario prompt). It is **never** baked into any plugin. It
encodes the brittle-witness posture:

> You are validating documentation on a fresh machine under **literal mode**. Do
> **exactly** the step you are asked, using only what the relevant plugin's own
> documentation instructs. Do **not** diagnose, repair, install missing
> prerequisites, edit configuration, or work around any obstacle. The **absence**
> of an explicit "ready/success" signal means *not set up* — never assume it
> worked. On the **first** thing that blocks you, **stop immediately** and report,
> verbatim: the exact command/step, its exact output, and what you believe is
> missing. Reaching a working end state by improvising is a **failure of this
> test**, not a success.

A scenario MAY append extra constraints (`literal_mode.extra` in the manifest), but
cannot weaken the base. The judge is handed the exact injected text so it can flag
where literal mode broke down.

## 7. Artifacts & report shape

Tier-E runs write to the same machine-local, out-of-tree results dir as Tier P,
adding an `eval/` subtree and a sibling **`cr-eval.json`**:

```
<results>/<timestamp>/
├── cr-report.json         # latest post_check.sh telemetry (Tier-P-shaped)
├── cr-logs/               # per-phase setup/post-check logs
└── eval/
    ├── setup-report.json  # immutable setup.sh report before post-check rewrites cr-report.json
    ├── prompt.txt         # the exact seed (literal-mode framing + stated purpose)
    ├── transcript.txt     # human-readable driven-agent transcript
    ├── turns.jsonl        # structured per-turn record (tool calls, outputs) when available
    ├── drive-runs.json    # per-run create-owned session, exit, timeout, duration, model
    ├── structured-result.json # agent-bridge bounded result snapshot when available
    ├── turn-detail.json   # expanded structured latest turn (prompt + exact tool calls)
    ├── literal-mode.txt   # the exact injected instruction block
    └── cr-eval.json       # the judge verdict + run metadata (below)
├── <scenario>-metrics.json # optional scenario-owned speed/cost/fidelity evidence
```

`cr-eval.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "scenario": "agent-vault-eval",
  "tier": "E", "family": "F2", "image": "base",
  "runs": [
    { "n": 1, "verdict": "PASS|FAIL|FALSE-PASS", "first_break": "<step or null>",
      "self_heals": ["<verbatim workaround, if any>"], "jams": ["<category>: <evidence>"],
      "credits": 2.7, "duration_s": 240, "transcript": "eval/transcript.txt" }
  ],
  "aggregate": { "verdict": "PASS|FAIL", "policy": "unanimous", "fix_owner": "<plugin/effort>" },
  "judge": "clean-room-judge", "judged_at": "<iso8601>"
}
```

The judge's structured verdict (its documented `VERDICT/STEPS/JAMS/FIX-OWNER`
shape) is stored under each run; `aggregate.verdict` applies the flake policy (§8).

## 8. Flakiness, cost & determinism policy

Tier E runs a **real model in a loop** — non-deterministic and credit-costing. The
policy that keeps it honest and affordable:

- **Local-only, never a blocking CI gate (today).** Per the vision's Non-Goals,
  Tier E is a **contribution/audit tool**, gated **behind** Tier P (which is the
  cheap CI-able gate). A run needs the bridge daemon + real credits.
- **Tier-P precondition.** Do not spend an eval on a box that fails Tier P — the
  runner refuses `-Mode eval` for a plugin whose `*-solo` Tier-P scenario is red
  (a broken CLI surface will fail the eval for the wrong reason).
- **N-run aggregation.** `runs.count` (default **1** for exploration) with
  `aggregate` ∈ {`unanimous`, `majority`}. **A claim used to gate a change
  requires `count ≥ 3` + `unanimous`** — a single green agent run is evidence, not
  proof. A **split** result is itself a finding (the docs are ambiguous enough that
  the agent sometimes self-heals) and is reported, not hidden.
- **Budgets & timeouts.** `per_turn_timeout_s` is **enforced** host-side (the drive
  runs in a bounded job; a turn that overruns is stopped and recorded
  `timed_out: true` — a hung agent is a FAIL, not an infinite wait).
  `runs.max_credits` is **advisory only**: the `agent-bridge create` transport does
  not surface per-turn credits to the runner, so it is recorded as intent but
  cannot be hard-enforced (a future transport that exposes usage would close this).
- **Tier-P precondition (enforced, cheap).** Before spending the drive, the runner
  runs a cheap in-box smoke of the plugin CLI — `manifest.tier_p_precondition`, else
  `<first installed plugin> --version` — and **refuses the eval** if it fails (a
  broken CLI surface would red the eval for the wrong reason). On by default;
  `-SkipTierPGate` forces past it.
- **Determinism caveats, stated not hidden.** Model version, temperature, and doc
  drift all move the result; `cr-eval.json` records the `copilot_version` and a
  hash of the injected prompt + the plugin docs the agent could see, so a verdict
  is reproducible-in-context and a regression is attributable.
- **Cost containment via literal mode.** The brittle-witness posture *also* caps
  cost: a literal agent **stops at the first obstacle** instead of burning credits
  hammering — so a broken scenario fails cheap.

## 9. Runner surface

Additive to today's `run.ps1`/`run.sh` (`-Mode eval` is implemented in **both**);
no change to Tier-P behavior.

```powershell
./run.ps1 -Scenario agent-vault-eval -Mode eval            # run one eval end-to-end (setup→gate→drive→capture)
./run.ps1 -Scenario agent-vault-eval -Mode eval -Runs 3    # N-run for a gating claim
./run.ps1 -Scenario agent-vault-eval -Mode eval -SkipTierPGate   # force past the in-box Tier-P precondition
./run.ps1 -Scenario harness-from-bare -Mode eval -Image base
```

- **`-Mode eval`** (auto-selected when `manifest.tier == "E"`) runs the §3 loop.
  Steps 1–2 reuse the existing build/setup path; step 3 reuses `bridge_register.py`;
  steps 4–5 add the **seed+capture** helper; steps 7–8 hand off to the
  `validating-in-clean-room` skill's judge delegation.
- **Judge invocation stays in the skill, not the shell runner.** The runner
  produces `eval/` evidence and *prints the exact judge packet path*; the skill (or
  an orchestrator) invokes `clean-room-judge` and writes `cr-eval.json`. This keeps
  the public shell runner free of any model/agent dependency (it stays
  Tier-P-hermetic) and keeps judging where the skill already documents it.
- **Transcript capture** is the one genuinely new mechanism: `agent-bridge send`
  returns the agent's reply, but a *full* transcript (tool calls + outputs) is
  richer evidence. Capture, in order of preference: (a) the agent-bridge session
  transcript for the sent turn; (b) the in-container `copilot --resume` session
  log; (c) at minimum, the returned reply text. Whichever is available lands in
  `eval/transcript.txt` (+ `turns.jsonl` when structured).

## 10. Homing (generic vs. downstream)

Per ARCHITECTURE §6, the split is unchanged and matters more for Tier E:

- **Generic, name-free E scenarios** (e.g. `agent-vault-eval` — "set up *this*
  plugin from its own docs") belong in the **public rig** (`tools/clean-room/
  scenarios/`): they audit a copilot-extensions plugin's own docs and name no
  operator repo.
- **Name-ful E scenarios** (e.g. `harness-from-bare` — "set up *my* harness",
  turn-key acceptance against a specific knowledge repo) live with the **consuming
  harness** and are mounted via `-Scenario <dir>`. The literal-mode fixture, the
  runner `-Mode eval` path, `cr-eval.json`, and the judge are all substrate, so a
  downstream E scenario needs no substrate change.

## 11. Phased build plan

1. **✅ Fixture + schema (docs → substrate).** `lib/literal-mode.md` shipped; the
   Tier-E scenario contract + `cr-eval.json` shape are specified here (§4, §7).
2. **✅ Reference eval scenario.** `scenarios/agent-vault-eval/` shipped
   (`manifest.json` + `setup.sh` + `expected.md` + `post_check.sh`) — the
   falsifying beachhead of §5.
3. **✅ Runner `-Mode eval` (seed + capture).** Implemented in `run.ps1`: establish
   the starting state (`setup.sh`), register the bridge agent, drive a **fresh
   session per run** (`agent-bridge create --prompt-file --expand all`; never
   `send`, which resumes a stale session), capture the transcript to `eval/`, run
   `post_check.sh`, and print the judge-packet path.
4. **✅ Judge wiring + `cr-eval.json`.** The `validating-in-clean-room` skill
   documents assembling the packet and invoking `clean-room-judge`; the verdict is
   written to `eval/cr-eval.json`. Validated end-to-end: `agent-vault-eval` yields
   a literal-mode PASS (agent stopped at the documented `.kdbx`/`KPDB` prerequisite;
   no self-heal, corroborated by `post_check.sh` ground-truth).
5. **◐ Flake/cost controls.** `-Runs N` + `runs.count`/`aggregate` are wired;
   `per_turn_timeout_s` is **enforced** (host-side bounded job → `timed_out`);
   the **prompt + evaluated-payload hash**, exact `acp_plugin_dirs`, and
   `copilot_version` are recorded in `eval/eval-run.json` for
   reproducible-in-context verdicts; when explicit plugin directories are
   supplied, the payload hash is computed from those directories rather than a
   potentially different installed copy. A cheap **in-box Tier-P precondition**
   (`<plugin> --version`, `-SkipTierPGate` to force) refuses an eval on a broken
   CLI. **Advisory-only:** `runs.max_credits` (the
   `agent-bridge create` transport doesn't expose per-turn credits to the runner).
6. **◐ The extreme F1-E.** The **public** suite-self-assembly eval is **built**:
   `scenarios/suite-assembly-eval/` installs the harness core (agent-worktrees base
   + agent-bridge) on a bare box and drives "get the suite working per its docs,
   then register a repo and create a worktree" — validated end-to-end to a PASS via
   the documented `setup → register → create` flow (and it surfaced #691:
   agent-worktrees doesn't self-provision). **Still future:** the fully name-ful
   **turn-key F3-E** — a *specific* assembled harness bound to an **empty** knowledge
   repo completing a real end-to-end task with zero manual setup — which homes
   **downstream** (with the consuming harness), not the public rig.
7. **◐ agent-dispatch suspend/resume (hibernate-the-wait) eval.** Slice 1
   (**suspend-only**) is **built + validated**: `scenarios/agent-dispatch-hibernate-eval/`
   installs agent-dispatch solo, arms a **caller-controlled signal** — a new
   substrate primitive `cr_signal_arm` / `cr_signal_wait_cmd` / `cr_signal_fire`
   (+ `cr_signal_waiter_present` / `cr_signal_fired`) in `lib/clean-room-lib.sh`: a
   truly-blocking wait (a FIFO read, no CPU spin) whose **wake edge the harness
   owns** — and drives "hand this blocking wait off per your docs." A literal PASS
   requires the agent to discover *hibernate-the-wait* and run
   `agent-dispatch run --detach --resume <wt> -- <signal-wait>`, leaving a **detached,
   tokenless** waiter (`post_check.sh` proves it: `post_detached_waiter=present`,
   `post_waiter_detached=yes` ppid→init, `post_agent_dispatch_run=yes`, then fires
   the signal and confirms `post_waiter_released_on_fire=yes`). Busy-waiting,
   hand-rolling a `nohup/&/setsid` waiter, or swapping in an own timer is a
   FALSE-PASS. Because the caller owns the wake edge, hibernation is **objectively
   observable** — the primitive is reusable infra for heavier agentic evals
   (externally-timed orchestration, not self-paced sleeps). **Still future:** Slice 2
   (**full round-trip**) — the detached waiter's agent-bridge resume nudge landing
   back in the *same* driven worktree/session — gated on a live bridge.

Each phase is independently useful: even Phase 3 (drive + capture, human-judged)
already delivers the operator's core ask — *point a fresh Copilot at our docs and
see what it does*.

## 12. Open questions / risks

- **Transcript fidelity over ACP/agent-bridge.** Exactly what structured turn data
  `agent-bridge send` exposes for a single-turn drive determines how rich
  `turns.jsonl` can be; Phase 3 must probe this and fall back to reply-text capture.
- **One-shot vs. multi-turn.** The design assumes a **single seed turn** (cleanest
  for literal mode). A future variant could allow a bounded multi-turn "keep going"
  loop, but that widens the self-heal surface — deferred.
- **Judging cost.** The judge is itself a model call; keep its input tight (the
  packet, not raw megabytes of logs) so an eval's total credit cost stays bounded.
- **Doc-drift attribution.** A verdict is only meaningful against the docs the
  agent could see; the prompt+docs hash (§8) is the mitigation, but a doc change
  that flips a verdict must be visible in review.
