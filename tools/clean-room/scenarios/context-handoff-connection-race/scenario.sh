# context-handoff-connection-race/scenario.sh -- Tier-P F1 repro rig for
# a known, privately tracked Copilot CLI issue: a single session that discovers
# `context-handoff` from TWO sources at once -- the marketplace-installed
# plugin copy AND a second copy present as a project-level extension in the
# working repo -- launches BOTH as real connections, and the second one hits
# validate_external_tools' same-session tool-name clash
# (generate_handoff_prompt/save_handoff_prompt/consume_handoff/trigger_handoff
# already registered by another connection).
#
# This is the mechanism actually confirmed against a live machine (both
# connections legitimately host-spawned by the SAME session, from two
# discovery sources for one plugin id) -- NOT a manually-invoked standalone
# extension_bootstrap.mjs process from outside the harness (that path was
# tried first and failed here for an unrelated, informative reason: a
# standalone-spawned process's stdio is not wired to any real host, so its
# `connect` RPC just times out). Reproducing the SAME-SESSION double-discovery
# needs no stdio trickery at all: it is the CLI's own normal extension-
# discovery + launch flow, run against a deliberately-duplicated source --
# but it DOES need a real HEADED session: `copilot -p` (headless) was tried
# first and never launches extensions at all (only skills load headlessly --
# confirmed by asking a headless session to call one of context-handoff's
# tools directly: the skill surfaced, the tool did not exist). `--acp` is the
# other candidate automation surface, but no clean-room-usable CLI-mode
# agent-bridge driver exists for it yet (separate in-flight effort). So this
# scenario drives a REAL interactive session via the new shared
# lib/tmux-drive.sh helper (tmux + `-i/--interactive` + send-keys) rather
# than `-p`.
#
# This is a REPRO rig, not a regression gate: a clean box is used specifically
# so the mechanism can be shown to reproduce independent of the machine/session
# state that first surfaced it. PASS here means the clash WAS observed; a miss
# is reported via `jam` since it means either the guard changed upstream, or
# this container's assumptions about the runtime's on-disk layout/log naming
# have drifted -- both are actionable, neither is silently ignored.
#
# Name-free / public F1. Asserts on the clash OUTCOME (extension log text),
# not exact CLI spelling or install paths (those are discovered, not
# hardcoded).
# Env: CR_MARKETPLACE_REPO / CR_MARKETPLACE_NAME.
