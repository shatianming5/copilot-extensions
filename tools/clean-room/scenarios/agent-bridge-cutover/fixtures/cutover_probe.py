"""Portable, stdlib-only cutover-resilience probe for agent-bridge.

Drives the OS-agnostic zdd graceful-cutover mechanism against a REAL installed
agent-bridge daemon, in an isolated config dir, and asserts the binding invariant
of the correct-install-flows effort (dotfiles#1393): *a version cutover must never
kill in-flight, non-resumable work*. agent-bridge stands a new daemon up beside the
old (``start --passive`` on a fresh port), health-gates it, flips the routing table
(``active.json``), drains the old at the TURN boundary, and retires it -- so a live
interactive session is not hard-killed and clients follow the routing flip.

It is the reusable core of the clean-room ``agent-bridge-cutover`` scenario: the
thin scenario.sh installs + provisions the plugin on a fresh box and runs this
probe, so the thorny orchestration is verifiable independently of Docker (it runs
on any OS with a built agent-bridge venv).

FIDELITY NOTE (honest scope). A *fully live* "session turn survives the flip"
assertion needs a real model/ACP child (agent-bridge cancels an in-flight turn
COOPERATIVELY with resume-on-reattach, then the session host re-adopts) -- that is
a Tier-E, model-in-the-loop concern, not stdlib-simulatable. This Tier-P probe
therefore proves the cutover MECHANISM the turn-survival guarantee is built on:
the routing active/passive flip + old-daemon retirement, the drain GATE (the turn
boundary at which in-flight work is waited on, not hard-killed), and cooperative
recovery of an aborted cutover. The live-turn survival itself is asserted by the
Tier-E agent-bridge eval, not here.

Checks (each prints ``PROBE: <name> PASS|FAIL <detail>``):
  routing-flip-retire  `deploy` stands a new daemon up beside the old, flips the
                       routing table, and retires the old -- clients resolve the
                       new daemon (beside-not-in-place; nothing hard-killed)
  drain-gate           `drain` opens the gate (/health -> draining: the turn
                       boundary at which new work is refused and in-flight work is
                       waited on); `undrain` releases it
  breadcrumb-recover   an aborted cutover strands a DRAINED survivor; recovery
                       (`deploy --recover`) undrains it (not stuck closed)
  abrupt-kill-recovery a real, live process holding a session-host claim
                       (stamped with a test-chosen generation label, not the
                       daemon's own real identity -- see the check's own
                       docstring for why) is SIGKILLed with no graceful
                       shutdown, and a fresh generation started afterward
                       still comes up clean and does not sit stuck behind
                       the now-genuinely-dead pid's stale claim -- the
                       dead-PID recovery primitive, not interruption of a

    """A generation is SIGKILLed before it can run its own exit contract (the
    ``/api/v1/shutdown`` release-every-claim path, #4543) -- the "kill the old
    generation before it releases its claims" drill this effort's Phase 5
    calls for. A stale session-host claim it never released must not wedge a
    later generation forever: ``zdd.claims.is_recoverable`` treats a claim
    whose owner pid is dead as free for the taking, no live handshake
    required (Phase 2's contract) -- this proves that holds for a REAL killed
    daemon process (its actual own pid, actually SIGKILLed) recovered by a
    REAL fresh daemon's own real startup reattach scan, not just the
    pure-function unit tests in ``libs/zdd/tests/test_claims.py``.

    **Real generation id.** The claim below is stamped with the killed
    daemon's own REAL ``_generation_id`` -- read back from
    ``running-version.json``, the local marker file
    ``runtime_version.set_running_generation_id()`` writes once the
    daemon's ``SessionManager`` computes it at boot (see that module's own
    docstring for why this file rather than ``/health``). This still does
    NOT exercise the graceful exit-contract release path
    (``release_all(self._generation_id)``) -- that path never runs on an
    abrupt SIGKILL by design, which is the entire point of this drill (see
    ``test_admin_routes_phase3.py`` for that narrower, already-unit-tested
    graceful-release claim). What this drill adds is *dead-pid detection*
    against a real OS process, now stamped with the SAME generation id the
    live daemon itself would have used, a real unit test cannot exercise.

    Two synchronization hazards a naive version of this check gets wrong
    (both review-caught in earlier revisions -- kept documented here so they
    are not reintroduced):
      1. The daemon's own ONE-SHOT startup reattach scan (a background task,
         never periodic -- ``app.py``'s ``_reattach_session_hosts_bg``) would
         reap an orphan record (no adoptable DB session) the instant it
         runs, whether the record predates startup or arrives moments after
         -- so a fixed sleep before registering the test record is a race,
         not a real synchronization point (the scan may spend up to its own
         remote-recovery budget). A **sentinel** orphan record is seeded
         *before* the daemon starts and polled until removed -- its removal
         is the daemon's own real scan having actually run to completion --
         before the real test record is registered.
      2. The record's *recovery* must be observed as done BY THE REAL FRESH
         DAEMON's own background task, not by a disconnected direct
         ``HostIndex.claim()`` call standing in for "a new generation" --
         otherwise the check can pass while the real daemon's own recovery
         path silently does nothing. This fixture creates no adoptable DB
         session, so the production path's only valid terminal outcome is a
         full reap (claim, then remove -- "no adoptable session on
         reattach"); this check polls the on-disk index after the fresh
         daemon starts and requires the record to be **gone**, never
         "claimed under the fresh daemon's pid" as an alternate pass --
         that would let the check observe the intermediate claim write and
         pass even if the record's subsequent removal then silently fails
         (removal is itself best-effort/suppressed in production).
