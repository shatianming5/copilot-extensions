"""Build the "main release form" from a `dev`-shaped checkout: snapshot the
whole tree, then materialize every remaining dev-only reference into the
self-contained shipped form. This is the whole-repo counterpart of
`preview_release.py`'s single-plugin materialization, and a validated
prototype of the promotion pipeline's core step (Phase 3 of the
dev-branch-release-pipeline effort).

Two still-live dev-only forms are expanded here:

* **File pointers** -- any single vendored file (e.g. a mirrored Markdown
  doc under `plugins/<plugin>/docs/`) whose first line is an in-language
  HTML-comment marker:
  `<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=<repo-relative-path> kind=file -->`. The
  pointer *is* the mirrored file itself, so materializing overwrites the stub
  in place with the canonical file's bytes.
* **`uv`-editable canonical references** -- a consumer's `pyproject.toml`
  `[tool.uv.sources]` entry whose `path` escapes the consumer's own root
  (for example `{ path = "../../libs/<lib>", editable = true }`) instead of
  vendoring a local `libs/<lib>` copy at all. `dev` resolves this live via
  `uv`; a shipped `main` release cannot, so promotion copies canonical's
  complete lib tree into the consumer's own `libs/<lib>/` and rewrites the
  entry to the local, non-editable `{ path = "libs/<lib>" }` form.

A third materialized surface carries `agent-worktrees`' packaged
launch-wrapper fallback: on `dev`, the authoritative wrapper scripts live only
under `worktree-manager/bin/`; promotion copies the files listed in
`plugins/agent-worktrees/launch-wrapper-assets.json` into
`plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/` so a shipped payload never depends on a sibling
`worktree-manager/` checkout being present.

    relative ``path`` was authored against -- the REAL, un-copied consumer
    directory, since a copy such as ``preview_release.py``'s single-plugin
    workdir tree can sit at a different nesting depth where the same
    relative path would resolve somewhere else entirely) into
    ``dest_consumer_dir``: copy canonical's complete lib tree (``src/``,
    ``README.md``, ``tests/``, and ``pyproject.toml`` itself -- the local
    copy has none of these until canonical's own are copied in) into
    ``dest_consumer_dir/libs/<lib>/``, then surgically rewrite
    ``dest_consumer_dir/pyproject.toml``'s entry to the local, non-editable
    ``{ path = "libs/<lib>" }`` form -- restoring exactly what a real
    vendored copy looks like today. This is the promotion-time inverse of
    ``sync-vendored-libs.py``'s ``--uv-editable`` conversion, and the step
    that makes the `uv`-editable form safe in production: a shipped
    ``main`` release never carries a live reference to a path that won't
    exist on the end-user's machine.

    Uses ``uv_editable_ref.find_uv_editable_refs`` (shared with the dev-time
    drift guard, not a second duplicate) -- which returns EVERY escaping
    entry regardless of whether ``editable`` is set. An entry missing
    ``editable = true`` is refused (``SKIP``) here rather than silently
    passed through: skipping it invisibly would let ``promote_release.py``
    ship the external path unchanged in a real release.

    ``source_consumer_dir`` and ``dest_consumer_dir`` are the same
    directory for a whole-repo snapshot (``materialize_main.py``'s own
    ``materialize()`` -- the copytree preserved the same nesting depth as
    the real checkout, so the authored relative path still resolves
    correctly against the copy itself) but differ for
    ``preview_release.py``'s single-plugin preview (source is the real
    ``plugins/<plugin>``, dest is a bare ``workdir/<plugin>`` with no
    monorepo ancestor of its own).

    ``dest_root`` is the actual snapshot root every destination-side
    ancestor check is bounded against (default: ``dest_consumer_dir``
    itself, for ``preview_release.py``'s single-consumer caller, which has
    no deeper "dest/plugins/<plugin>" structure of its own). For a
    whole-repo snapshot, ``materialize_uv_editable_refs()`` passes the real
    ``dest`` tree root -- checking only up to ``dest_consumer_dir`` would
    miss a symlinked ``dest/plugins`` itself (``build()`` preserves tracked
    symlinks, and this function's caller discovers consumer dirs via a
    symlink-following ``is_dir()``), letting it redirect the lib copy and
