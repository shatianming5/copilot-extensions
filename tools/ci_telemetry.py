"""Historical CI flakiness/reliability telemetry for `dev`.

Phase 1 of the ci-flakiness-telemetry-and-reliability effort
(`efforts/active/ci-flakiness-telemetry-and-reliability/README.md`). This is
**not** a rebuild of `tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py`'s reactive, single-run
detection+dedup: that script reacts in real time to one `workflow_run`
completion; this script mines the GitHub Actions REST API's run *history*
over a bounded lookback window to find recurring, high-impact noise no
single red run reveals on its own (see the effort README's Phase 0 decision).

It deliberately reuses `ci_failure_watchdog`'s own failure-signature
computation (`signature_key()` / `build_signatures()`) so both tools agree
on "is this the same failure" -- two independent signature schemes would
silently disagree and undermine both efforts' dedup guarantees.

Two signals are computed per distinct failure signature:

- **Rerun-recovery rate** -- of the distinct commits (`head_sha`) a
  signature was ever observed on, what fraction of those commits *also* had
  a later successful run with no code change in between (the same-commit-
  reran-and-passed pattern this repo has directly observed to distinguish a
  flake from a genuine regression).
- **Blocking impact** -- how many other runs on the branch were queued
  behind each failing run before the next success (the promotion pipeline
  only advances on a green run, so a red run stalls everything behind it).

Usage::

    python tools/ci_telemetry.py --db tools/ci_telemetry.sqlite3 refresh   # fetch + persist (needs gh + GH_TOKEN)
    python tools/ci_telemetry.py --db tools/ci_telemetry.sqlite3 report     # print the ranked report from persisted data

`refresh` is the only network-touching subcommand; `report` only reads the
already-populated database, so it works offline and is what CI/local
spot-checks should use after a `refresh`.
