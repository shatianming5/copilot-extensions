"""Tests for tools/coverage_guided_selection -- the coverage-guided-ci Phase 0
design-spike prototype (see efforts/active/coverage-guided-ci's 2026-10-01
Journal entry).

`test_select_*` and `test_fallback_*` are synthetic and fast: they construct
a baseline dict by hand so selection/curation logic is verified against a
known-correct expectation, independent of any real pytest/coverage run.

`test_collect_baseline_round_trips_against_a_real_plugin_suite` is the one
real integration check: it runs `baseline.collect_baseline` against the
`ai-attribution` plugin's own (small, fast) suite via an ephemeral
`uv run --with coverage --with pytest-cov` subprocess, and asserts the
round-trip produces internally consistent, real coverage/duration data --
proving Phase 0's "spike coverage collection ... confirm the artifact it
produces round-trips through the chosen storage/correlation mechanism"
checklist item against a real suite, not just synthetic data. It is
deliberately **opt-in**: it self-skips unless `CGS_RUN_INTEGRATION_TEST=1`
is set, since it spawns a real subprocess with network-dependent package
resolution rather than running as part of the fast, always-on, pure-stdlib
synthetic tests above. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the synthetic tests
in every PR's required `checks` job, and this one test only in a separate,
workflow_dispatch-only `coverage-guided-selection-integration` job.
