"""Phase 3 of the dev-branch-release-pipeline effort
(ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3336): promote ``dev``'s current,
already-CI-green state onto ``main`` as a single **generated commit** whose
tree wholesale-replaces ``main``'s -- never a merge of ``dev`` into ``main``.

The promotion, in order:

1. Check out ``dev`` into an isolated ``git worktree`` (never mutates the
   caller's real working tree).
2. Consume every pending changefile (``tools/changefile.py``) via
   ``tools/accumulate_bumps.py``'s ``compute()``/``apply()`` -- writes the
   real per-plugin version bumps and removes the changefiles that requested
   them, exactly as a contributor-driven ``--apply`` run would.
3. Expand every DRY vendor pointer (``tools/materialize_main.py``) so the
   generated ``main`` commit carries full vendored-library copies, never a
   pointer file -- ``main`` is the form every consumer's Copilot CLI
   actually installs from, and pointers are a `dev`-only compression.
4. Build a git tree object from the processed worktree and, if it differs
   from ``main``'s current tree, create a new commit whose **parent is
   ``main``'s current tip** but whose **tree is entirely `dev`'s processed
   state** -- i.e. a wholesale replace, not a three-way merge.
5. Tag the generated commit with full traceability metadata: the promoted
   ``dev`` commit range, the plugins bumped (old -> new version), and the
   changefiles consumed.

Nothing here pushes anything by default -- ``--push`` is required to move
the real ``refs/heads/main`` and push the tag to ``origin``. Without it this
tool only reports what *would* happen (the Validation Plan's required dry
run before flipping branch protection on the real ``main``).

Usage::

    python tools/promote_release.py --dry-run
    python tools/promote_release.py --push

    branch (which a real, protected ``main`` will reject -- a personal
    GitHub account's branch rulesets have no way to grant a bypass to the
    GitHub Actions app the way an organization's can), the commit is pushed
    to ``refs/heads/<candidate_branch>`` and the caller
    (``validate-and-promote.yml``, via ``gh pr create``/``gh pr merge``) is
    responsible for landing it on
    ``main`` through a real pull request -- the same sanctioned path every
    other change to this repo already uses. The tag is intentionally left
    unpushed in that mode: its target should be the real post-merge commit
    on ``main``, not this pre-merge candidate, whose sha a squash-merge
    replaces. Without ``candidate_branch``, the original direct-push
    behavior is unchanged (used by the test suite and any trusted/

    promotion reads a small correlation **pointer** from and checks THAT
    (never the full file) into the generated commit's own tree at
    ``COVERAGE_BASELINES_DIR`` -- see
    ``_write_coverage_baselines_into_scratch``'s own docstring for the
    ``measured_commit`` consistency check this performs before accepting
    any of them, and for the full per-line data's own publication contract
    (a GitHub Release asset the caller publishes separately, only AFTER
