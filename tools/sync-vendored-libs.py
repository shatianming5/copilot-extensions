"""Keep top-level ``libs/<lib>`` canonical sources and their per-plugin
``plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>`` vendored copies from silently drifting apart.

``check-vendored-libs-sync.py`` already guards one half of this invariant: it
verifies every *copy* of a lib is byte-identical to every other copy. It does
**not** compare copies against the top-level ``libs/<lib>`` canonical source at
all -- so canonical can drift from what's actually shipped without any guard
ever noticing. That already happened in practice (see the dev-branch-release-
pipeline effort's Journal): ``libs/ssh-manager`` sat at ``0.1.0-dev12`` while
every real vendored copy had independently advanced to ``0.1.0-dev21`` and
picked up an entire missing module (``relay_channel.py``). Materializing FROM
that canonical source today would silently regress every consumer.

This tool closes that gap in three modes:

* ``--check`` (default, safe): report canonical-vs-copies drift as advisory
  (does not fail CI -- no existing workflow depends on this invariant yet, and
  a hard failure here would surprise unrelated PRs). Also re-runs the
  existing copies-vs-copies check.
* ``--restore-canonical``: the safe direction *today*, given that copies are
  the verified-consistent, actually-shipped truth. Copies a lib's first copy
  (after confirming all copies agree) up into the top-level ``libs/<lib>``,
  creating that canonical root when missing and replacing its complete
  filtered lib tree (``src/``, ``tests/`` when present, ``README.md``,
  ``pyproject.toml``, and any other real tracked files, while still ignoring
  build/cache cruft). Never touches plugin copies.
* ``--materialize``: the FUTURE direction once canonical is restored and kept
  current -- copies top-level ``libs/<lib>`` DOWN into every
  ``plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>``. This is the shape the dev/main release
  pipeline's promotion-time generator will eventually call. Refuses to run for
  any lib whose *copies* carry a newer declared version than canonical (the
  "someone edited a copy directly and never touched canonical" hazard), unless
  ``--force`` is passed, so it can never silently regress a consumer. It is
  NOT blocked merely because content differs when canonical is the newer
  side -- that is the normal, expected pre-materialize state.

### Legacy directory-pointer compatibility

Older checkouts or fixtures may still carry a ``VENDOR_POINTER.json`` beside a
vendored lib copy. That shape is retired repo-wide: this tool no longer writes
it, and ``tools/materialize_main.py`` / ``tools/preview_release.py`` no longer
expand it during promotion or preview. ``sync-vendored-libs.py`` still
recognizes the legacy form only so compatibility helpers such as
``--restore-canonical``, ``--materialize``, and ``--uv-editable`` can reason
about an already-existing pointer copy instead of treating it as a real source
tree.

A legacy pointer copy is never a "real copy": its ``src/`` (if any) is never
this lib's real, verified-agreeing content, so it stays excluded from
copies-vs-copies agreement checks and from ``--restore-canonical``'s "which
copy is the truth" selection -- treating a pointer's own content as truth
would silently **wipe canonical**. ``--materialize`` still knows how to
refresh such a legacy copy in-place for compatibility purposes: it replaces
the marker with real ``src/`` + version content from canonical, and refreshes
``tests/`` only when the copy already carried its own copy of them.

Two pointer *kinds* exist, both identified purely by ``VENDOR_POINTER.json``:

* **bare** -- ``src/`` doesn't exist at all. Never actually installable
  (`uv pip install -e .` fails outright: "does not appear to be a Python
  project", confirmed empirically) -- unusable for any plugin still
  developed/tested on `dev` (i.e. every real plugin today), only ever safe
  for a lib whose consuming plugin has itself been fully retired from `dev`.
* **src-passthrough** (``--pointerize``, agent-cli-lazy-dispatch Phase 2's
  first real adopter, ``plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/lazy-cli-dispatch``) --
  carries a real, importable ``src/<pkg>/__init__.py`` marked with a
  ``# VENDOR_POINTER: source=libs/<lib> kind=src-passthrough`` first-line
  comment, whose body sets its own package ``__path__`` to canonical's real
  ``libs/<lib>/src/<pkg>`` directory. Every import of the vendored package
  resolves through ordinary Python import machinery straight to canonical's
  real modules -- `uv pip install -e .`, `run-plugin-tests.py`, and CI's own
  test-runner job all keep working unmodified on `dev`, with zero copy-drift
  risk (there is nothing to keep in sync; editing canonical takes effect
  immediately). This tool's legacy ``--materialize`` compatibility mode still
  expands it into a real byte-identical copy exactly like the bare kind.

A THIRD, distinct mechanism -- not a `VENDOR_POINTER.json` pointer at all --
also exists: the **`uv`-editable canonical-reference form**
(`vendor-pointer-generalization` effort, Phase 1), the current, active
mechanism for real vendored libs (superseding `src-passthrough` above --
see this module's own Journal history for why). ``--uv-editable CONSUMER
LIB`` converts a copy (real or `src-passthrough`) into this form: the local
`plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>` (or `worktree-manager/libs/<lib>`) copy is
deleted entirely -- no directory, no stub -- and the consuming
`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv.sources]` entry is rewritten from
`{ path = "libs/<lib>" }` to `{ path = "<relative-to-repo-root>/libs/<lib>",
editable = true }`, which `uv` resolves live to canonical on `dev`
independent of the top-level package's own editable-ness. `--check` also
validates every such reference (missing `editable = true`, a missing/
symlinked canonical target). `tools/uv_editable_ref.py` holds the shared
implementation (used by this script and by `tools/materialize_main.py`'s
promotion-time expansion back into a real copy); see its own module
docstring for the full design.

Legacy `src-passthrough` pointer copies may still be recognized here for
compatibility with older checkouts or fixtures, but this tool no longer writes
that form: the repo retired `--pointerize` once the last real consumer moved
to either the `uv`-editable canonical-reference form or a full real vendored
copy.
