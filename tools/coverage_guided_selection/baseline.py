"""Collect a portable coverage baseline from a real pytest run.

Spawns a single ephemeral `uv run --with coverage --with pytest-cov --with
pytest-json-report` subprocess running a small in-process driver (written
to a temp file and executed in that same ephemeral venv) so baseline
collection needs no ambient dependency beyond `uv` itself: the driver runs
pytest, reads the resulting coverage database, and writes one merged JSON
result -- `coverage` and `pytest-json-report` are only ever imported inside
that ephemeral venv, never in this module's own caller process. This was
validated directly against a downstream consumer repository's own small
test suite during this effort's originating low-risk spike (see this
effort's own 2026-10-01 Journal entry).

The resulting baseline is deliberately pure JSON (`BASELINE_SCHEMA_VERSION`):
no live `coverage.py` database is carried past collection, so `selection` and
`fallback` stay pure-stdlib and have nothing upstream to go stale against
except the baseline file itself.

**Phase 0 scope note:** this prototype collects and serializes **line**
coverage only (no `--cov-branch`/arc data) -- the vision's own Concepts use
"lines/branches" generically since a realizing effort may pick either;
Phase 0 narrows that choice to lines only for this pilot, and this contract
is that narrowing's single source of truth for the code in this package.
Branch-level attribution, if ever needed, is later-phase scope.

    own writer before a baseline is checked into `main`.
