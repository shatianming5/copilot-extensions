"""Phase 2: nearest-ancestor baseline resolution + attribution remap/invalidate.

Realizes this effort's own Phase 2 (see `efforts/active/coverage-guided-ci`'s
Plan): given an arbitrary fork-point commit (typically a PR branch's own
merge-base against `dev`, which may sit behind `main`'s current baseline
generation, or behind several), resolve the **newest** coverage baseline
checked into `main` (see `correlation.py`) whose own `measured_commit` is an
ancestor of that fork point, per the vision's "baseline reachable from any
fork point" Feature -- then carry that baseline's line-level attribution
forward through every intervening commit's own diff, file by file:

- A file whose diff between the baseline's `measured_commit` and the fork
  point is **entirely pure insertions/deletions** (no hunk both removes and
  adds lines -- i.e. no hunk actually replaces/edits existing content) has
  its covered line numbers translated through the diff's own line-number
  shift, with one deliberate asymmetry: a line preceded by a **deletion**
  is safely remapped (a test that already reached it in the old code can't
  be retroactively un-reached by removing unrelated code elsewhere), but a
  line preceded by an **insertion** is treated the same as deleted-outright
  attribution -- dropped, not remapped -- because newly inserted code can
  introduce new control flow (an early `return`, a new guard clause) that
  causes a previously-reaching test to no longer reach it, and hunk
  lengths alone can't prove an insertion was execution-neutral. A line
  that was itself deleted always drops out (correct: it no longer exists
  to be covered).
- A file with **any** hunk that both removes and adds lines genuinely
  changed content, so old line numbers inside it can't be trusted to still
  mean the same thing -- that file's attribution is **invalidated**
  (dropped from the resulting baseline's ``coverage`` map entirely), which
  `selection.select_tests` already treats as ``no_baseline_entry`` --
  forcing the smoke/coverage-debt fallback for that file specifically,
  never a silently stale selection.

This module only reads git history (``git log``, ``git show``, ``git diff``,
``git merge-base``) from an already-fetched local clone -- it performs no
network I/O of its own and never writes anything.
