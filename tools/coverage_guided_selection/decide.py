"""Phase 3: one orchestrating, auditable decision.

Ties every Phase 1-3 piece together into the single question a CI run
actually needs answered: *given this plugin and this PR's own changed
lines, which tests should run, and why?*

1. `ancestor_resolution.resolve_nearest_baseline` -- find the nearest
   qualifying baseline pointer on `main` (no network I/O).
2. `correlation.fetch_baseline_asset` -- download that generation's full
   coverage map from its Release asset (network I/O).
3. `debt.assess_debt` -- is this resolved generation too stale to trust.
   If so, curate the fallback tier from the full baseline directly
   (step 6) and skip straight past remap/selection below -- there is no
   point remapping attribution this run has already decided not to trust.
4. `ancestor_resolution.remap_or_invalidate_baseline` -- otherwise, carry
   its attribution forward to the fork commit.
5. `selection.select_tests` -- diff-scoped selection against the changed
   lines, using the remapped attribution.
6. `fallback.compute_fallback_set` -- the safety-net tier, whenever step 3
   or step 5 trips it. Always curated from the **full**, un-remapped
   baseline -- remapping (step 4) drops coverage for exactly the files
   this diff touches, which would shrink the fallback universe precisely
   on the riskiest files. Its own candidate pool is restricted to
   `fallback.default_tier_eligible_tests`'s real, test-portfolio-tier-
   derived eligible set (T0-T2/untiered, never T3/T4) unless a caller
   explicitly overrides `eligible_tests`.

Every path returns one `SelectionDecision`: which tests to run, which mode
produced them (`"selected"` or `"fallback"`), why, and which baseline
generation (if any) was used -- the vision's own "make the selection
auditable" Behavior. Pure orchestration; no new coverage-collection or
git-history logic of its own.
