"""Guard the bootstrap-check session-start hook against accidental drift (#167).

Every runtime plugin ships ``scripts/bootstrap-check.{ps1,sh}`` -- the
session-start hook that auto-reconciles a stale runtime after a
``copilot plugin update``. These files were once described as "byte-identical
across agent-* runtime plugins", but that is no longer true and *should not* be
forced: the plugins fall into a few genuinely different **deploy-model families**
(a versioned-venv reconcile that locates its source from ``$PSScriptRoot``, one
that reads the deploy manifest's ``source.path``, and a lib-copy model). Forcing
one byte-identical template would break real behavior.

So instead of asserting global byte-identity, this check freezes the intentional
**classification**: it declares which plugins belong to which family and verifies
that

* every runtime plugin (one that ships a ``bootstrap-check.ps1``) is classified
  in exactly one family, and
* every plugin within a multi-member family is byte-identical (both ``.ps1`` and
  ``.sh``) to its siblings.

That catches the drift that actually bites -- someone editing one member of a
shared family but not the others (e.g. the ``.venv`` vs ``venv`` guard fix that
had to be hand-propagated) -- and forces a *conscious* FAMILIES edit when a new
plugin or a new variant is introduced, while permitting the intentional
divergence. Run with ``--list`` to print the current grouping.

Usage::

    python tools/check-bootstrap-sync.py           # verify (CI / pre-push)
    python tools/check-bootstrap-sync.py --list      # show the family grouping
