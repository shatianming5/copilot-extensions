"""Local guard: fail if any private/internal identifier appears in the tree.

This repo is public, so it must never contain internal org/account/project
identifiers (employer org names, internal repo names, personal aliases, …).
A denylist that *named* those strings would itself leak them, so the list is
**never stored in this repo**. It is sourced, privately, from:

  1. env ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_FORBIDDEN_IDS`` (comma-separated), and
  2. ``~/.agent-codespaces/forbidden-identifiers.txt`` (one per line; blank
     lines and ``#`` comments ignored), and
  3. env ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_FORBIDDEN_IDS_CI`` (newline- or ``;``-separated
     ``token|reason`` entries for CI/trusted-workflow use -- backed in
     production by the ``FORBIDDEN_IDS_FACILITY`` / ``FORBIDDEN_IDS_WORK``
     repository secrets consumed by
     ``.github/workflows/identifier-leak-guard.yml``, which documents the
     exact provisioning command), and
  4. a best-effort **live cross-repo sweep**, when a locally registered
     ``agent-worktrees`` installation is discoverable: ``agent-worktrees
     identifiers sweep --format json`` (run with this repo as cwd, so it
     auto-resolves as the sweep target) aggregates every other locally
     registered repo's own ``.identifier-blocklist/block-for-<tier>.yaml``
     denylist, scoped to this repo's own registered audience-exposure tier.
     The JSON format (rather than the CLI's own default ``ci`` text format)
     is used so a parse failure in one peer repo's blocklist still carries
     whatever entries DID parse successfully, for :class:`LiveSweepFailure`.
     See ``plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/identifier_blocklist.py``
     for the mechanism and ``docs/identifier-blocklist.md`` for the
     convention. This source is silently absent wherever ``agent-worktrees``
     isn't installed or this repo isn't registered (a fresh clone, CI) --
     never required, only additive on a machine that has it. Opt out with
     ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_DISABLE_LIVE_SWEEP=1``.

CI entries (sources 3 and 4 share this grammar) are case-insensitive literal
substrings by default. Prefix a token with ``regex:`` to match a Python
regular expression instead (for example
``regex:\\bexample\\b|Standalone name -- use a generic placeholder``). The
prefix is a matching mode, not part of the reported match. Double a regex
alternation pipe (``||``) in the secret to distinguish it from the first
single ``|`` separating the reason; reasons may contain pipes. Regex entries
cannot contain semicolons or newlines, which delimit entries.

**Gotcha specific to source 3:** unlike source 2's local loader, the CI-mode
loader (``_load_ci_identifiers``) skips blank entries but does **not** skip
``#``-prefixed comment lines -- every non-empty line becomes a literal
token, including a bare ``#`` on its own line, which matches almost any
Markdown heading. Never paste a commented source file straight into
``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_FORBIDDEN_IDS_CI`` (or the secrets above) -- strip
comments and blank lines first (e.g. ``grep -vE '^\\s*#|^\\s*$' file``).
Source 4 never has this gotcha: it only ever reads its own generated
``identifiers sweep`` output, never a hand-pasted file.

With none of these configured (a fresh clone with no local ``agent-worktrees``
registration, or CI with no secret) there is nothing to enforce and the check
is a no-op (exit 0) -- so it is safe to ship in the public repo. On your own
machine, populate one of sources 1/2/3 by hand, or simply register this repo
with ``agent-worktrees`` (source 4) and let the live sweep do the work; wire
this up as a git ``pre-push`` hook either way, and it blocks a push that would
leak any of your identifiers.

Scope: by default the guard only scans the files your push actually **changes**
(``git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD``, base ``origin/main`` -- override via
``--base`` or ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_GUARD_BASE``). This keeps a pre-existing
identifier in an *untouched* file from blocking every unrelated push, while
still catching anything a push introduces. Pass ``--all`` to audit the whole
tracked tree instead (useful for a one-off full sweep). If the base ref can't
be resolved (no ``origin/main`` in a fresh clone), the guard falls back to a
full-tree scan. Trusted CI may instead pass ``--paths-file`` plus ``--git-ref``
to scan repo-relative paths from a fetched PR-head tree-ish as inert git data
without checking out or executing that revision.

Run manually:  python tools/check-no-internal-identifiers.py          # push diff
               python tools/check-no-internal-identifiers.py --all    # whole tree
Exit code 0 = clean (or nothing configured), 1 = a forbidden identifier was
found (suitable for a pre-push hook).

The same two private sources drive the agent-codespaces scaffold guard
(``plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_config_init.py``).

    Absent anywhere this isn't installed/registered (a fresh clone, CI) --
    a missing binary, a timeout, or any other environment-level failure to
    even run the command is silently swallowed so this is purely additive,
    never a new requirement. Set ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_DISABLE_LIVE_SWEEP=1``

    A sweep that DID run but failed (nonzero exit -- e.g. another locally

    different: that is a genuinely broken *local configuration*, not mere
    absence, so it is never silently swallowed. It raises
    :class:`LiveSweepFailure`, which still carries whatever identifiers the
    sweep DID manage to parse before failing, so a caller can use them
    defensively while still treating the overall result as a failure. This
    is why the sweep is invoked with ``--format json`` rather than the
    default ``ci`` text format: the CI format is deliberately all-or-nothing
    on failure (nothing at all on stdout, to avoid ever piping a silently
    partial denylist into a consumer that might ignore the exit code), so
    only the JSON diagnostic format actually carries the partially-parsed
    entries this class promises.

    One specific nonzero-exit case is NOT a configuration failure, though:
    an installed ``agent-worktrees`` old enough to predate this feature
    entirely rejects ``identifiers`` with its generic "Unknown subcommand"
    dispatcher error -- that is absence (an unupdated install), not
    breakage, so it is treated the same as the binary not existing at all.

    adopted as an ``agent-worktrees`` project on this machine) is rejected

    resolve a project" response -- also benign absence, not breakage.
