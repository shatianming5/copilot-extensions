"""Tests for the Picker inbox-discipline guard.

The guard flags a raw ``call_from_thread(`` call anywhere in the Picker's
own ``picker_tui/`` source (``inbox.py`` itself is exempt -- it IS the
sanctioned wake primitive). It is AST-based (docstrings/comments never
count) and supports an inline ``# inbox-guard: allow <reason>`` escape
hatch.
