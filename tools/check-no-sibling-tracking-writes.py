"""Guard: no sibling plugin may import an ``agent_worktrees`` tracking-record
WRITE function directly.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 4: the resident
daemon (via ``tracking_write.py``'s verb registry) is meant to become the
SOLE path that mutates a worktree's tracking YAML, with agent-worktrees'
own CLI commands as its only direct callers. A sibling plugin importing one
of these functions itself would let it write worktree state independent of
whatever the daemon's own lock/cache/verb machinery is doing --
reintroducing exactly the cross-process atomicity/staleness hazard this
effort exists to close, even though the survey that founded this effort
(see the effort's own README § "How this was found") found zero such
violations across every existing sibling plugin at the time. This guard
makes that finding an enforced invariant instead of a point-in-time grep
that could go stale silently as new call sites are added.

**Scope: every ``plugins/*`` directory except ``agent-worktrees`` itself**
-- NOT filtered by an ``agent-*`` name prefix (this repo ships several
non-``agent-*``-named plugins too, e.g. ``visions``,
``customizing-copilot``); the invariant this guard enforces has nothing to
do with a plugin's naming convention, so scanning by name would create a
blind spot for exactly the plugins that don't happen to match it. This
mirrors the effort's own surveyed scope and Plan language in spirit ("any
sibling plugin imports a tracking.py write function") even though that
prose used "sibling plugin" loosely; the actual enforced scope is
everything under ``plugins/`` but the owning plugin. It deliberately does
NOT cover ``worktree-manager/`` (a separate, non-plugin, out-of-plugin
control-plane app under ``worktree-manager-control-plane``, outside
``plugins/`` entirely): that app's Picker (``data_local.py``, via its own
in-process ``_engine_runtime`` bridge) already calls several of these same
write functions directly today (``stamp_bound_live``, ``stamp_mux_live``,
``stamp_session_state``) -- a KNOWN, already-tracked architectural gap, not
an oversight this guard should silently flag or block. See
`efforts/active/worktree-manager-control-plane/README.md` Phase 3d ("Design
the `data_local.py` hot path -- needs a new batched verb") for its own
tracked resolution, explicitly sequenced after that effort's Phase 3c.
Extending this guard's scope to cover that app is a deliberate, separate,
cross-effort decision -- not something to fold in here without that
coordination.

The read-only accessors this guard does NOT flag
(``load_record_by_id``, ``find_worktree_id_by_cwd``,
``find_worktree_id_by_session``, ``load_record``, ``list_records``, and
similar) remain a sanctioned, documented surface, consistent with every
sibling plugin's actual (all read-only) usage found by the effort's
original survey.

**Maintenance note:** :data:`WRITE_FUNCTIONS` is a hand-curated denylist,
not derived automatically -- update it (and :data:`TRACKING_MODULES` if a
new module needs protecting) in the same PR that adds a new
tracking-record write function (a function whose body persists a
``WorktreeRecord``, directly or via the async stamp queue, including a
new daemon verb handler) to any of the currently-protected modules:
``tracking.py`` / ``tracking_lifecycle.py`` / ``tracking_claims.py`` /
``tracking_session_registry.py`` / ``tracking_controller_relations.py`` /
``tracking_write.py`` / the 6 ``tracking_*_write.py`` verb-handler
modules.

Exit code 0 = no sibling-plugin direct-write imports found, 1 = found one.
