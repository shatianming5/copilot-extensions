    a manual liveness/staleness check.

    A manual scheme (read a recorded holder PID, check whether it's
    still alive, unlink-and-retry if not) is NOT atomic: two waiters can
    both observe the same dead PID, both unlink the stale lock, and the
    SECOND of them can then also unlink the FIRST's newly created, very
    much live replacement purely by pathname -- a real two-caller
    reproduction against exactly that design converged on two DIFFERENT
    published keys instead of one, defeating the entire point of this
    lock. An OS-backed primitive has no such window: the OS itself owns
    exclusivity and releases it automatically the instant the holding
    process exits for ANY reason, including a crash, so there is no
    separate "is the old holder still alive" question to answer or race
    to get wrong.
