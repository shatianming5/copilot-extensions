"""Block check-in of oversized files, with a generous allowance for images.

Direct follow-up to the ``main-history-rewrite`` effort: ``main``'s history
had accumulated ~300MB across 160+ oversized ``.github/coverage-baselines/``
blobs (up to ~14MB each) before that design moved to GitHub Release assets
(see PRs #5078/#5085/#5097/#5098). That data dump never had a tooling guard
against it landing in git in the first place -- this check is that guard,
so the same mistake (or a different large generated artifact: a raw diff, a
source map, a vendored data dump) can't quietly recur.

**Two caps, chosen from a full sweep of the tracked corpus at the time this
guard was added** (see the ``main-history-rewrite`` effort's Journal for the
underlying numbers): the largest legitimate non-image file in the tree was
~440KB and the largest legitimate image was the README's own ~1.7MB GIF.
Both caps below sit comfortably above those with real headroom for organic
growth, while still catching a runaway blob (the old coverage-baseline
JSONs ranged 1MB-14MB) outright:

* **Images** (``IMAGE_EXTENSIONS``) -- a visual reference (a screenshot, a
  design preview, a demo GIF) is expected to be checked in; these get a
  generous :data:`IMAGE_CAP_BYTES`.
* **Everything else** gets the much tighter :data:`DEFAULT_CAP_BYTES` --
  source, docs, and test-fixture JSON are all comfortably under it today,
  so this is a real backstop against new bloat, not a description of the
  status quo.

**Always-blocked extensions** (``ALWAYS_BLOCKED_EXTENSIONS``) -- a source
map or a raw diff/patch file is a generated-or-derived artifact that never
belongs hand-committed, regardless of size (none currently exist in the
tree, so this has zero pre-existing debt to grandfather).

**Diff mode checks every commit in the range individually, not just the net
difference between the range's endpoints.** A naive tree-to-tree diff would
miss a commit that adds an oversized/disallowed blob and a later commit in
the *same push* that deletes or shrinks it -- the oversized blob is still
permanently in the pushed history at that point, which is exactly the
accumulation this guard exists to prevent (it is, verbatim, how the
coverage-baseline bloat this guard follows up on actually happened: each
promotion both added a new oversized baseline snapshot and left the
previous one in history). For each commit newly reachable in the range,
this diffs it against its own first parent (``git diff-tree``) and checks
every path THAT commit touches at its own blob size -- not an object-level
"is this blob content new to the whole repository" scan
(``git rev-list --objects``), which would silently miss a rename/type-change
whose content happens to be byte-identical to something already elsewhere
in history (the content isn't new, even though the path is).

Like ``check-module-size.py`` and ``check-effort-vision-structure.py``, this
only checks the range's own commits -- nothing already on ``origin/dev``
before this diff started ever blocks an unrelated change.

Every size check reads the actual git blob -- the index for explicit staged
paths, the object store for diff/full-tree modes -- never the working
tree. This makes the guard immune to a working-tree/git mismatch (a staged
oversized file whose working-tree copy is later shrunk or deleted without
re-staging would otherwise slip through; conversely an unrelated
working-tree edit could wrongly flag a safely-sized staged blob). All git
output is read NUL-delimited (``-z``) and decoded explicitly as UTF-8
(never the ambient locale encoding, which can silently mis-decode a
non-ASCII path on a non-UTF-8-locale platform) -- never the default quoted/
locale-decoded form, so a filename with non-ASCII characters, a tab, or a
newline can't be silently misread as missing and skipped.

Usage::

    check-large-files.py -- FILE [FILE ...]  # check exactly these paths against the INDEX (pre-commit, staged)
                                              # the "--" is required so a staged file literally named
                                              # "--all" (or any other flag-shaped name) is never parsed
                                              # as an option instead of a path.
    check-large-files.py                     # every blob new in HEAD vs --base (default origin/dev)
    check-large-files.py --base <ref> [--head <ref>]
    check-large-files.py --all [--head <ref>] # full-tree sweep at one revision (CI guards-full-sweep;
                                               # default --head: HEAD)

Exit code 0 = nothing over cap (or nothing to check), 1 = a checked file
violates a cap or is an always-blocked extension.

    its own post-commit blob size. Checking per-commit rather than only the
    whole range's net tree-to-tree difference is what makes a rename (same
    blob content, same object id, merely a new path) still inspected at its
    new path: ``git rev-list --objects`` considers such a blob *not new* to
    the repository (the same content is already reachable via its old
    path/commit), so it would otherwise never surface in an object-level
    scan -- see the module docstring's new-blobs rationale, which this
    function implements per-commit rather than for the whole range as one
    object-reachability query.

    For a MERGE commit (more than one parent), a path is excluded if its
    blob is UNCHANGED from any parent OTHER than the first -- diffing only
    against the first parent would otherwise flag every file a merge
    brings in from a second parent (e.g. a long-lived feature branch
    merging its base branch in) as "newly touched" by this commit, even
    though that content already existed on the base and is not this
    branch's own new content; only a file the merge's own conflict
    resolution actually changed (different from EVERY parent) is this
    commit's own responsibility.

    ``git diff-tree --raw`` (rather than ``--name-only``) gives the new
    blob sha and file mode directly, which both (a) lets a submodule
    gitlink (mode ``160000``) be excluded deliberately rather than treated
    as an unreadable blob (see ``_REGULAR_FILE_MODES``), and (b) saves a
    separate ``cat-file``/lookup round-trip per path to learn the sha.
    Its own ``-z`` only affects its own output (no external piped input to
    worry about, unlike the earlier ``rev-list --objects`` attempt), so
    this can safely use it for a filename containing non-ASCII characters,
    a tab, or a newline -- git quotes such names in plain ``--name-only``
    output, which would otherwise make a lookup against the (mis-parsed,
    quoted) name fail and silently skip the real file. Raises
    :class:`GitEnumerationError` if any underlying git command fails,

    confirmed is a real, non-gitlink blob -- never silently skipped.
