"""Host-wide admission-lease coordination for ``run_tests_in_devcontainer.py``.

Closes the third Phase 2 residual gap: ``tools/run-plugin-tests.py``'s own
``--admission-wait`` lease lives under ``$HOME``/``$XDG_CACHE_HOME``, which
is a fresh per-container tmpfs for every wrapped invocation -- so two
wrapped runs (or a wrapped run and a bare ``run-plugin-tests.py``
invocation) never actually contend for the same host-wide heavy-test
slot the way two bare invocations would. This module acquires that SAME
lease on the HOST, before the container does any real work, and holds it
for the run's entire lifetime -- so the two invocation styles correctly
serialize against each other. The lock dir/service name come from
``tools/_admission_protocol.py``, a shared module both this file and
``run-plugin-tests.py`` import, so neither duplicates that contract by
hand.
