# venue-copilot

Shared, provider-agnostic reserve/connect/release orchestration for a venue's
CLI-mode `copilot` launch verb (`agent-codespaces copilot <name>` /
`agent-containers copilot <name>` -- `agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions` Phase 4).

## Why a shared lib (not inside either provider plugin)

Both providers run the *same* three steps around a completely different
transport (OpenSSH via `ssh-manager` + a durable Connection Owner tenant hold
for CodeSpaces; OpenSSH into a trusted container or a restricted-fleet
`docker exec` for containers):

1. Reserve the worktree's next CLI-mode Session Host slot on the host
   `agent-bridge` daemon (`agent-bridge --json live-sessions cli-mode
   reserve`).
2. Build the exact remote command that runs `agent-worktrees copilot
   --worktree-id <id> [--driver] [--seed] [--ensure-mux]` *inside* the venue
   -- the same local `copilot` verb (PR #3126), just dispatched over an
   interactive channel rather than reimplementing attach logic a third time.
3. Release the reservation once the interactive session ends, whatever the
   outcome -- a `finally`, not a happy-path-only cleanup.

Only step 2's *transport* (how the remote command is actually run: which SSH
argv, which reverse forwards, whether a tenancy hold needs periodic
heartbeating while attached) differs per provider. Vendoring this shared core
(the same way as `ssh-manager` / `credential-relay`) keeps that difference
the only thing each provider's own `copilot` command has to own.

## Contents

- `venue_copilot.reserve_cli_mode` / `release_cli_mode` -- thin JSON-parsing
  wrappers around the `agent-bridge` CLI binstub (shelled out to, not
  imported -- a provider plugin's venv does not contain `agent_bridge`; see
  `credential-relay`'s own README for the same constraint).
- `venue_copilot.build_copilot_remote_command` -- the exact remote command
  string.
- `venue_copilot.run_venue_copilot` -- the reserve -> `connect` -> release
  orchestration. `connect` is the one provider-supplied callback: given the
  remote command string, it opens the actual interactive channel and returns
  its exit code.

## Vendoring

**In dev**, every consumer's `pyproject.toml` references this library through
a `uv`-editable canonical pointer (`vendor-pointer-generalization` effort,
Phase 1) --
`agent-venue-copilot = { path = "../../libs/venue-copilot", editable = true }`
-- so every consumer resolves to this one source tree; there is no per-plugin
dev copy to keep in sync.

**At release**, `tools/materialize_main.py` rewrites that same pointer into a
real, promoted copy at `plugins/<plugin>/libs/venue-copilot/` for each
consumer -- non-editable, so a published plugin installs a self-contained
source tree with no cross-plugin `path` reference. `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py
--check` verifies every materialized copy's `src/` tree and version stay
byte-identical to this canonical one and to each other.
