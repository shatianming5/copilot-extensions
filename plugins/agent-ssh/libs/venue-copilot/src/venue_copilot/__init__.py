"""Shared venue-side CLI-mode ``copilot`` launch orchestration.

Provider-agnostic core for ``agent-codespaces copilot <name>`` / ``agent-
containers copilot <name>`` (agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions Phase 4): reserve a
worktree's CLI-mode Session Host slot via the host ``agent-bridge`` daemon,
build the remote ``agent-worktrees copilot`` command that ensures/attaches the
muxed session *inside* the venue, hand off to a provider-supplied ``connect``
callback that actually opens the interactive channel (each provider's
transport differs -- OpenSSH via ``ssh-manager`` for CodeSpaces, OpenSSH into a
trusted container, or a restricted-fleet ``docker exec`` for containers), and
always release the reservation afterward.

Only ``connect`` is provider-specific; reserve/build-command/release is
identical across venues, hence this shared canonical lib. In `dev`, consumers
reach it through `uv`-editable canonical references
(`vendor-pointer-generalization` effort, Phase 1); at promotion,
`tools/materialize_main.py` rewrites those references back into real local
copies inside each shipped plugin payload.

    rather than reimplementing attach logic a third time. The venue must
    already carry a *full* ``agent-worktrees`` install (not just its lean
    self-provisioned tools) for this to resolve.

    ``detach=True`` runs ``agent-worktrees embody`` instead -- the same
    create-or-resume of the muxed session, but it returns a JSON result
    instead of attaching, and never re-seeds a session that already exists.
    ``bridge_scope_id`` / ``copilot_args`` forward ``--bridge-scope-id`` /
    ``--copilot-arg`` (the registration identity and extra Copilot flags such
    as ``--plugin-dir=...``). ``login_shell=False`` returns the bare command
    for a caller that already wraps it in its own login shell.

    ``anchor=True`` forwards ``--anchor`` instead of ``--worktree-id
    <worktree_id>`` -- a CodeSpace/container venue is conventionally
    anchor-only (the devcontainer/CodeSpace already clones the repo directly;
    there is no worktree unless an operator explicitly created one), matching
    headless ACP dispatch's own existing behavior of running straight in the
    anchor checkout. ``worktree_id`` is still required in this case (as the
    CLI-mode reservation identity -- see :func:`reserve_cli_mode`), but is
    never forwarded to the remote command itself.

    Wrapped in ``bash -lc`` (a login shell): confirmed live against a real
    disposable trusted-container venue (agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions Phase
    4 validation) that OpenSSH's non-interactive remote-command exec never
    sources ``~/.profile``/``~/.bashrc`` -- exactly where
    ``agent-worktrees``'s own install flow appends ``~/.local/bin`` to PATH
    (its own getting-started doc's "``~/.local/bin`` is on PATH" check is a
    login-shell-only guarantee). Without this, a fully, correctly installed
    remote ``agent-worktrees`` binstub still resolves to
