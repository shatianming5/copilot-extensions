# Setting Up an SSH Host (dtssh)

Expose a Windows machine's **interactive user session** over SSH-through-Dev-Tunnel
so it can be reached and driven from other machines — landing remote clients as
the **real Entra user** (e.g. `CORP\you`), not a stand-in service account. This
is the host-side companion to `setting-up-ssh-client`.

The tool is **[dtssh](https://github.com/bmiddha/devtunnel-ssh)** (a turn-key
dev-tunnel-with-SSH). It provisions a dedicated per-user loopback `sshd`,
auto-manages the SSH key, pins the host key, and hosts an **owner-only** Dev
Tunnel — so there is **no OpenSSH Server, no `sshd_config`, no `authorized_keys`
ACL, and no local service account** to manage by hand on the system OpenSSH path.

## Why dtssh (the Entra-`sshd` wall)

Windows `sshd` cannot reliably resolve Entra-joined-only cloud accounts (SIDs like
`S-1-12-1-*`); a manual OpenSSH host fails with `ga_init unable to resolve user`.
dtssh sidesteps this entirely by running **its own** loopback listener as *you*,
the interactive user — so you land as the real Entra identity and can attach your
user-side psmux / editor / agent sessions, which a service account never could.

> **Interactive, user-side — not headless.** Those sessions live only inside your
> interactive logon and carry *your* credentials, so the host runs **as you, at
> logon**. Intended flow: **log in once → confirm the host is up → disconnect RDP
> (the session and listener persist) → drive over `ssh dt-<host>` from anywhere.**
> True headless (cold boot, nobody logged in) is out of scope by design.

## 1. Install and host with the in-box transport script

From the `agent-ssh` plugin directory (checkout or installed payload):

```powershell
pwsh -File .\transports\dtssh\scripts\install-host.ps1 install -Alias <host>
```

The script installs or updates dtssh under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dtssh\bin`, installs a
no-admin Win32-OpenSSH `sshd` when needed, prompts `dtssh login` if the
Dev Tunnel account is not signed in (unless `-SkipLogin`), installs the hidden
Startup-folder launcher, and starts it unless `-NoStart`.

The installer also preserves the dedicated SSH server host identity before any
update and restores it before relaunch. When `OneDriveCommercial` points at an
available OneDrive for Business folder, the key pair is backed up under its
machine-alias-scoped `.agent-ssh\dtssh-host-identities` directory. Otherwise a
separate local backup under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agent-ssh-dtssh` prevents dtssh state
recreation from silently rotating the key. Set
`AGENT_SSH_DTSSH_HOST_KEY_BACKUP_ROOT` or pass `-HostKeyBackupRoot` to select an
explicit durable location. Existing local keys seed an empty backup; a valid
backup restores missing local keys; mismatched or partial identities fail closed
before the running host is stopped.

### AV / Defender caveat

Scripts that download and install networking binaries are sometimes flagged as
trojan-like. Prefer this plugin's script (which uses the upstream dtssh installer
and a scoped Win32-OpenSSH download) over ad-hoc `Invoke-WebRequest`-of-an-exe
patterns.

## 2. Authentication

The script calls `dtssh login` when needed. If login falls back to a blocked
device-code flow, launch WAM in its own window and retry:

```powershell
Start-Process devtunnel -ArgumentList "user","login","--entra"
devtunnel user show
```

`dtssh host --persist` provisions the key, pins the host key, and hosts a
dedicated loopback `sshd` (`:2222`) reachable **only** through an **owner-only**
Dev Tunnel — private to your Entra identity by construction (no
`--allow-anonymous`, no `--tenant`/`--repo` grant). The SSH key is a second
factor; the identity gate is the tunnel owner.

## 3. Persist across logon

The session is user-side, so host it from a **logon Startup launcher** (not a
SYSTEM/scheduled task — the sessions need your interactive token, and non-elevated
task creation is often blocked on managed Dev Boxes). Point a hidden Startup-folder
shortcut at a small launcher that runs `dtssh host --persist` at logon; it then
fires whenever you RDP/console-log-on and persists after you disconnect.

That is exactly what `transports/dtssh/scripts/install-host.ps1` installs. Its
actions are `install`, `update`, `status`, `start`, `stop`, and `uninstall`; it
drives the self-healing
`transports/dtssh/scripts/dtssh-host-launcher.ps1` from a hidden Startup-folder
shortcut.

### Updating dtssh

`install-host.ps1 update` performs a transport-safe binary swap: it retires the
running watchdog + host child (freeing the locked `dtssh.exe`), replaces the
binary via the upstream SHA-verified `install-release.ps1`, then restarts the
self-healing launcher on the new binary. Pin a specific release with
`-DtsshVersion`:

```powershell
# from the plugin dir (or the deployed copy):
pwsh -File transports/dtssh/scripts/install-host.ps1 update -Alias <host> -DtsshVersion v0.2.0
```

The host reconnects on the new binary within ~1–2 min (first start of dtssh
≥ v0.2.0 downloads its bundled portable OpenSSH). No manual rename-aside /
hand-download is needed — `update` now refreshes an existing binary instead of
silently no-oping. On Linux the sibling `install-host.sh update` (honoring
`DTSSH_VERSION`) does the same via `dtssh service`.

## 4. Validate

```powershell
# host is up, launcher is installed, and sshd is serving an SSH banner:
pwsh -File .\transports\dtssh\scripts\install-host.ps1 status -Alias <host>
# a client on the SAME Entra account then runs `dtssh discover` + `ssh dt-<host>`
```

From a client, configure `setting-up-ssh-client` and run `ssh dt-<host>` — you
should land as the real Entra user.

## Reaching WSL (or another behind-the-host listener) as its own SSH target

To reach a **WSL** distro — or any service that only listens on the host's
loopback — as its *own* first-class SSH alias, **do not** stand up a second dtssh
host, and **do not** run dtssh *inside* WSL. Instead **ProxyJump through the
machine's existing dtssh host** to the loopback listener:

```
# ~/.ssh/config (or a config.d/ fragment)
Host dt-<host>-wsl
    HostName localhost          # resolved on the jump host = the Windows box
    Port 2200                   # the WSL sshd's dedicated loopback port
    User <linux-user>
    ProxyJump dt-<host>         # the machine's existing dtssh host
    IdentityFile <existing-local-private-key>
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
    ServerAliveInterval 30
```

`ssh dt-<host>-wsl` then lands inside WSL as the Linux user. Why this is the
**preferred** manner:

- **Zero extra tunnels.** It rides the machine's existing `dt-<host>` Dev Tunnel —
  no second tunnel to create, renew, or ACL, and the mesh stays at one tunnel per
  machine no matter how many WSL targets exist. (dtssh *inside* WSL would add a
  tunnel per machine.)
- **No WSL egress and no WSL devtunnel login required.** The tunnel is hosted on
  the Windows box (which has egress and is already signed in); WSL is reached over
  local loopback. This matters because dtssh-*in*-WSL is unworkable on two common
  walls: WSL with **no outbound egress** can't host a tunnel at all, and WSL has
  **no OS keyring** so an in-WSL `devtunnel` login can't persist its token (the
  host loops on "Login required"; the device-code fallback is separately
  Conditional-Access-blocked).
- **Works for any loopback listener** behind the host, not just WSL.

> **Note on `HostName localhost` + `ProxyJump`.** `localhost:2200` is resolved on <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow doc-example -->
> the **jump host** (the Windows box), where WSL `localhostForwarding` maps it to
> the WSL sshd. The `-W` forward the jump performs requires the dtssh host's sshd
> to permit TCP forwarding (it does by default).

### When the ProxyJump→localhost path is blocked: the `wsl` transport (interop)

The ProxyJump wiring above depends on Windows→WSL **TCP** working. On a machine
behind a **corp network filter** — notably the **Global Secure Access** (Entra)
client — that path is dead in **both** WSL networking modes: under `mirrored`,
`localhostForwarding` is a documented no-op and the host→WSL loopback relay never
opens; switching to `nat` is worse (GSA leaves the WSL vNIC with no IP and no
egress). sshd is healthy *inside* WSL, but nothing reaches it from Windows.

The fix is the in-box **`wsl` transport**: bridge the SSH last hop through the
**`wsl.exe` interop** channel (a stdio pipe GSA does **not** filter) instead of a
TCP connection. A process launched via `wsl.exe` reaches WSL's own loopback fine,
so pipe SSH through it and let `nc` inside WSL make the local connection:

```
Host <host>-wsl
    User <linux-user>
    ProxyCommand wsl.exe -d <distro> -u <linux-user> exec nc 127.0.0.1 2200
    IdentityFile <existing-local-private-key>
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

Generate this with the transport rather than hand-writing it:

```bash
python transports/wsl/deploy/emit-registry.py --machines machines.yaml --out wsl-registry.yaml
python -m agent_ssh emit-profile wsl-registry.yaml --module transports/wsl/module.yaml
```

When `--identity-file` is omitted, the emitter selects an existing local
private key with a sibling `.pub` (machine-scoped key first, then canonical
`id_ed25519`, then another local keypair). The provisioning flow seeds those
public keys into WSL, so the emitted profile must never name a nonexistent
default key.

`emit-registry` auto-detects the local machine's `ssh.environments` `wsl` entry
and emits a one-record registry; the core renders `50-agent-ssh-wsl.conf`. This is
a **local** transport — `wsl.exe` runs on the same box, so it reaches only that
machine's WSL, and only while an **interactive Windows session** is up (the
keepalive pins WSL up). WSL needs `nc` (`netcat-openbsd`) installed. No inbound
port, no WSL egress, no ProxyJump. (See `transports/wsl/module.yaml`.)

### Provisioning WSL itself — bring your own, or use `wsl-setup`

This ProxyJump wiring only needs an sshd **listening on a known loopback port
with your client key authorized** — it is agnostic to *how* WSL got there.
Provision WSL however you prefer; the **`wsl-setup`** plugin's `setting-up-wsl`
skill is one turn-key path (distro + NAT networking + a dedicated-port sshd + a
windowless keepalive). Whatever mechanism you bring, the target must meet three
requirements:

- **sshd on a dedicated loopback port (e.g. 2200), not `:22`** — a Windows sshd
  commonly binds `:22` and shadows the WSL `localhostForwarding` relay,
  intermittently breaking the target.
- **A keepalive** so the distro doesn't idle-terminate — an idle WSL distro stops
  in ~2 minutes and silently kills the listener. Use `wsl-setup`'s keepalive or
  your own.
- **Your client public key in the WSL user's `authorized_keys`** (the tunnel owner
  is the identity gate; the SSH key is the second factor, as everywhere in dtssh).

## Gotchas

- **WinGet `Links\*.exe` shims don't run over SSH.** App-Execution-Alias reparse
  points (e.g. `…\WinGet\Links\psmux.exe`) fail over a non-interactive SSH logon
  (*"cannot execute the specified program"*). Invoke the real exe under
  `…\WinGet\Packages\…` or wrap in `pwsh -Command`.
- **Same account both sides.** Client and host must be signed in to dtssh with the
  **same** Entra identity, or the owner-only tunnel won't admit the client.
- **Domain-joined hosts.** A genuinely domain/hybrid-joined Windows host (on-prem
  AD SID `S-1-5-21-*`) *can* run real-identity OpenSSH directly, but dtssh is the
  portable path that works on Entra-joined-only Dev Boxes too.
