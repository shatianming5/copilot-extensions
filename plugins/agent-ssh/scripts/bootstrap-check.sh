# One shared, repo-wide switch (not per-plugin) that pauses EVERY adopting
# plugin's reconcile-on-session-start at once, for when an operator/agent is
# hand-diagnosing a venv/install and a background reconcile must not race it.
# Legacy/default installation ONLY: a namespaced marketplace cell
# (COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT set) reconciles through its own cell-scoped
# mechanism, never this global state file -- crossing that installation-cell
# boundary would let one marketplace's switch pause an unrelated,
# independently-owned cell's reconcile (visions/plugin-services/
# installation-cells). This guard is therefore a deliberate no-op under a
# cell context, same as this hook's own existing cell-context exit below.

# agent-ssh session-start hook -- version-gated runtime reconcile.
#
# Runs at session start (via hooks.json). Ensures the installed agent-ssh
# binstub/venv matches the plugin source version, so a `copilot plugin update`
# that bumps the payload is picked up automatically -- without any manual
# reinstall.
#
# Fast path: compare the deployed version (~/.agent-ssh/deploy-manifest.json) to
# the source version (plugin pyproject.toml). If they match and the venv exists,
# exit immediately. Otherwise re-run the plugin's own installer (scripts/init ->
# canonical install) in the BACKGROUND so session start never blocks on a venv
# build; the versioned-venv swap is atomic, so concurrent use stays safe.
#
# Deployed to ~/.agent-ssh/bin/ by scripts/install.sh. Only reconciles staleness.
#
# NO OPT-IN GATE (agent-bridge-unified-zdd-cutover Phase 0): background
# reconcile used to require a checked-in, per-project opt-in flag in
# <project>/.copilot-extensions/config.yaml, because a raw reconcile could
# race a live session. Now that every reconcile-capable plugin's update
# path is always-ZDD (safe to run unattended), that justification is gone;
# the gate was removed rather than kept as a redundant consent checkbox.
# Frequency/trigger stays deliberately bounded -- still only once per
# session start, only on a real version drift. What DOES still bound
# concurrency is the single-flight + stale-reap guard below (a lock file,
# not the removed opt-in).
