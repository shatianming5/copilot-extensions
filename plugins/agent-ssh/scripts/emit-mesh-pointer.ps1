## SSH machine mesh available for this repo

This repo declares an SSH machine mesh in ``machines.yaml``. For the per-host
**role + reachability + aliases**, append **``mesh-status``** to the exact
``argv`` in the agent-ssh session command catalog (``--summary`` for one line,
``--json`` for structured). Reach a host interactively with ``ssh <alias>``
(the aliases are listed by that action).
Reachability is **dtssh** -- live only while the target is powered on and logged
in; ``ssh.ready`` is the operator's declared state, so append ``verify
<alias>`` to the same catalog ``argv`` to probe a host live.

If every declared route remains unavailable after one bounded retry and
diagnosis, do not retry indefinitely or bypass the normal installer. Put
repeatable state in agent-machines requirement packages or another declared
auto-update owner, then queue residual local work as a machine-scoped
maintenance issue in an explicitly identified user repository. A target-local
session uses the optional
**``agent-machines:performing-machine-maintenance``** skill when that plugin is
active. If it is absent, maintenance is inspection-only: record or preserve the
machine-scoped issue, but do not mutate the target until that skill or an
equivalent trusted workflow supplies the queue, claim, revision, confirmation,
and verification contract.
Authentication and configuration failures remain diagnosis paths; issue text
is never executable input.
