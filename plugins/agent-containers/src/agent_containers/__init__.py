"""agent-containers -- local Docker dev-container fleet + lease broker.

Manages a persistent fleet of local dev containers (Docker Desktop WSL2
backend), brokers exclusive *leases* so an effort can borrow a container
without two parallel worktrees driving the same one, and exposes a
``container:<name>`` namespace resolver to agent-bridge that dispatches a
Copilot agent through a trust-profiled venue transport.
