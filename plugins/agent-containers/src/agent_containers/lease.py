"""Lease broker -- exclusive borrowing of fleet containers.

State of record is a host-side JSON file (``~/.agent-containers/leases.json``)
guarded by an exclusive lock file for race-safety across parallel worktree
agents on the same machine. Leases are *advisory*: the ``container:`` resolver
does not hard-block dispatch, but ``borrow`` will not hand out a container that
is already leased to a live holder.

A lease can be reclaimed during acquisition when its exact same-host,
same-environment holder PID is definitively gone and no provider lifecycle or
session admission protects the container. Remote, cross-environment, legacy,
and otherwise indeterminate holders remain leased until the TTL.
