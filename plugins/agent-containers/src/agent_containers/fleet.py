"""Fleet provisioning -- create/start/stop/remove a pool of dev containers.

A *fleet* is a named pool of long-lived dev containers built from one
devcontainer spec. Containers are kept warm (stopped, not destroyed) between
uses; an effort borrows one via the lease broker.

Two provisioning backends:

* ``devcontainer_path`` set -> use the ``devcontainer`` CLI (full lifecycle:
  build, onCreate clone + rush install, postStart). Each instance is tagged
  with id-labels (including ``agent-containers.fleet``) and renamed to
  ``<prefix>-<n>``. This is Model A (repo cloned inside the container).
* ``image`` set -> ``docker run`` a warm container directly (lightweight; for
  images that already carry their tooling).
