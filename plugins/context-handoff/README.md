# context-handoff

Context window monitoring and session handoff for GitHub Copilot CLI.

This plugin ships three cooperating pieces:

| Piece | Type | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **continuity guidance hook** | Declarative `sessionStart` hook | Injects a concise, owner-marked `additionalContext` kernel that tells objective-owning sessions to work thoroughly across context windows, treat handoff as a relay rather than completion, and move unfinished planning into execution without bypassing required gates |
| **context-handoff extension** | Copilot CLI session extension (`extension.mjs`) | Monitors `session.usage_info` for exact token counts; applies percentage-based soft/hard thresholds (55% / 70% by default) with optional repository overrides, delivered on the next idle; provides `generate_handoff_prompt`, `save_handoff_prompt`, `consume_handoff`, `continue_handoff`, and `retry_handoff_cutover` tools plus the **`/handoff-continue`** and **`/resume-handoff`** slash commands. In Herdr, `save_handoff_prompt` writes a checkout-scoped one-time machine-local file without probing agent-worktrees, and `continue_handoff` calls the installed `copilot-pane launch --task-file` path exactly once to create a seeded sibling while retaining the predecessor. Outside Herdr, a reachable coordinator plus linked worktree still stores a `proposed`/`handoff` task and uses the existing mux cutover, with the prior machine-local file fallback. `retry_handoff_cutover` re-attempts a live cutover from the **already-saved** handoff without regeneration. `/resume-handoff` digs up this checkout's pending handoff (task, else file), consumes it once, and **injects its continuation prompt into the current session** |
| **context-handoff skill** | Skill | The `/handoff` workflow -- composes the continuation prompt from the extension's structured facts and the agent's live context. (Resume is handled by the extension's `/resume-handoff` command, which injects the handoff; the skill documents both) |

## Why the monitor is an extension

The live monitor is **only** possible as a session extension. The Copilot CLI
hook surface a plugin normally uses cannot replicate it:

- **No hook input carries token counts.** `session.usage_info` (current /
  limit tokens) is delivered only to the extension SDK via
  `session.on("session.usage_info", ...)`. No `sessionStart` / `postToolUse`
  hook input exposes it.
- **Command hooks cannot inject a turn.** The extension's nudge works by
  queueing a `session.send()` message from the `session.usage_info` handler and
  delivering it on the next `session.idle` boundary. Command-hook output is
  discarded (only `preToolUse` can *deny* a tool call, not inject a message).

So token monitoring and idle-boundary nudges require the extension payload.
The ambient continuity contract does not: it is delivered independently through
the plugin's declarative `sessionStart` hook, following the repository's
context-injection pattern.

The hook intentionally treats plugin enablement as its applicability gate. Its
policy is capability-generic and source-neutral, so it does not inspect
`sessionStart` `cwd` or `source`, assume a mux or worktree is present, or exclude
resumed sessions. Detailed handoff mechanics select the available task, file,
live-cutover, or paste path on demand.

## How the extension is delivered (no install step)

This is a **plugin-contributed extension**. The Copilot CLI discovers
extensions contributed by **enabled** installed plugins directly from the
plugin's `extensions/` directory (the `plugin` extension source) -- it scans
each `extensions/<name>/` subdir holding an `extension.{mjs,cjs,js}` file. This
plugin ships exactly one:

```
plugins/context-handoff/extensions/context-handoff/extension.mjs
```

There is **no** installed runtime, venv, binstub, copy to
`~/.copilot/extensions/`, deploy manifest, or `scripts/install.*`. Enabling the
plugin is the whole setup; the extension activates on the **next** Copilot CLI
session (extensions are scanned at startup).

## Requirements

Two conditions must hold for the extension to load -- both are handled outside
this plugin:

1. **The plugin must be enabled.** `context-handoff@copilot-extensions: true`
   in `enabledPlugins` (user `~/.copilot/settings.json`, or a repo's
   `.github/copilot/settings.json`). A marketplace plugin's `extensions/` dir is
   only scanned when the plugin is enabled.
2. **`experimental: true`** in `~/.copilot/settings.json` -- the CLI gates *all*
   extension loading behind it. Set it directly if your environment has not
   already done so. This plugin does not set it and does not require registering
   the repo with agent-worktrees.

Herdr live cutover is optional. When the current process has
`HERDR_ENV=1` plus `HERDR_PANE_ID`, the extension expects the separately managed
`~/.local/bin/copilot-pane` launcher. No extra environment variable or manual
seed command is required; `/handoff-continue` selects that path automatically
and resolves the checkout from `herdr pane current --current` rather than a
possibly stale Copilot process cwd.

## Verify

A session where the plugin hook loaded receives an owner marker beginning with
`[owner: context-handoff@...]` in `additionalContext`. Without an adopted
aggregate authority, an adjacent agent-worktrees payload also contributes that
payload's exact command in an honestly attributed `adjacent-compatibility`
catalog. Adjacency is a payload-presence check, not an assertion that
agent-worktrees is enabled in the current session; the catalog reports `ready`
only when both its command and installer are present, otherwise `unavailable`.
With the exact compatible `context-injection@copilot-extensions` authority
adopted, this plugin contributes only its compact continuity kernel and
agent-worktrees contributes its own catalog to the deterministic aggregate.
The POSIX compatibility catalog requires a system
`python3` or `python`; without one, the valid continuity kernel still emits by
itself. A standalone context-handoff installation also emits only its own
kernel. A loaded extension exposes the `generate_handoff_prompt`,
`save_handoff_prompt`, `consume_handoff`, `continue_handoff`, and
`retry_handoff_cutover` tools, plus
`/handoff-continue` and `/resume-handoff`; `/extensions` lists it with source **plugin**. It
intentionally does **not** emit a user-visible "Session started" breadcrumb. If
it does not load, confirm both requirements above and start a fresh session (the
`context-handoff-setup` troubleshooting skill walks through this).

## Thresholds

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| 55% of window | Soft reminder: hand off at the next clean boundary |
| 70% of window | Urgent reminder: hand off now; compaction remains at ~80% |

An owning repository may override either percentage in
`.context-handoff/config.yaml`:

```yaml
thresholds:
  soft_percent: 65
  hard_percent: 75
```

The extension discovers the nearest Git repository root from the session's
starting directory, so the same config applies from nested directories and Git
worktrees. Values must be integers from 1 through 79, and `soft_percent` must be
lower than `hard_percent`. Invalid config produces a visible warning and uses
the 55% / 70% defaults. If the runtime does not report a window size, the
extension reports utilization as unknown and does not invent an absolute
threshold.

Reminder state resets after a successful compaction.

In both cases the extension emits a user-visible `session.log` warning and an
agent-facing `session.send()` nudge. The nudge is queued by
`session.usage_info` and delivered only at the next `session.idle` boundary, so
it does not interrupt an in-flight turn. Failures to send the nudge are logged
as warnings; they do not block the session.

## Live cutover keeps a recovery predecessor

A live cutover (`continue_handoff`) selects the pane host already carrying the
current session. In Herdr it writes the successor seed to a short-lived,
owner-readable task file and invokes `~/.local/bin/copilot-pane launch --role
coordinator --cwd <cwd> --host local --task-file <file>`. The launcher creates
one sibling Copilot and submits that seed as its first prompt. Context-handoff
does not infer completion from Herdr status and does not retire the predecessor
pane.

Outside Herdr, the existing mux path passes the exact first prompt through
Copilot's native `-i` argv before the process starts; it never relies on
terminal readiness parsing or `send-keys`. The prompt begins with the task title
(for useful successor title inference), names the intended worktree id and cwd,
names the dispatch task, and gives the exact consume/bind/retire/complete
commands. It does **not** retire the predecessor on the predecessor's next idle.

The successor's first command loads the brief and binds the new session to the
handoff's exact durable token. That atomic bind links the numbered handoff,
records the outgoing session as **`handed-off`**, advances the replayable head
ledger, and then retires the predecessor pane through
`agent-worktrees handoff-cutover --retire-pane`.

This keeps recovery safe: if the successor never comes up or never consumes the
handoff, the predecessor pane remains available and the terminal is not closed.
Herdr keeps that pane unconditionally. Mux metadata records the predecessor's
session; retirement verifies that the pane token still belongs to that session,
so a token reused after a mux restart is treated as already gone rather than an
unrelated pane to interrupt.

### Continuity is objective-driven, not phase-driven

The successor seed and `/resume-handoff` prompt treat the handoff as active
responsibility for the original objective. A completed predecessor phase is
history, not evidence that the broader work is done. After loading the brief,
the successor continues every actionable phase already permitted by the
original request without waiting for another user nudge. One session may consume
a handoff, drive many additional slices, and hand off again when its own context
fills.

The handoff template therefore separates the continuing parent objective and
successor work roster from completed progress, and distinguishes the current
handoff task's completion gate from the worktree's true completion gate. If no
actionable work remains and the parent objective is genuinely complete, the
session should finish instead of creating a live successor only to report
closure.

When agent-worktrees reports a valid open `active_effort`, the skill uses a
smaller effort-backed shape: repository-relative effort pointer, participant,
current/next slice, and only the predecessor's immediate blockers, decisions,
in-flight work, and required confirmations. The effort README remains the
single durable request/plan/journal; the baton does not copy it. Repositories
without effort adoption, stale/closed bindings, and objectives with no effort
continue to use the full standalone handoff.

The live `-i` seed reinforces that contract before the successor reads the
baton: an active effort is the source of truth and completion gate, so the
successor selects its next authorized Plan or Validation Plan item and drives
toward `Done` rather than finalizing after a handoff task, phase, or pull request.

**Failed-successor recovery (`retry_handoff_cutover`).** The native `-i`
transport is receipt-checked by the pane wrapper; a rejected flag or immediately
exiting successor is reaped without retiring the predecessor. Because the
handoff is already stored, `retry_handoff_cutover` re-attempts the cutover **from
that saved handoff without regenerating it**: it recovers the checkout's pending
task/file, rebuilds the *identical* cutover seed (via the same `buildCutoverSeed`
used by `save_handoff_prompt`), and spawns a fresh seeded successor. Run it from
the predecessor.

**Extension-load race (self-healing seed).** A live cutover seeds the
successor's **first turn**, which can run before the context-handoff extension
has finished (re)loading on the fresh launch — so `consume_handoff` is in the
tool catalog (tool search finds it) but invoking it fails with a transient
**400 / tool-not-found**. Because the session must exist (a prompt submitted)
before the extension can activate, the extension cannot pre-empt this from
inside. So the **cutover seed itself carries a retry-on-not-ready instruction**:
if the first `consume_handoff` call errors while the extension is still loading,
the successor waits briefly and retries the same call (up to 5 attempts) so the
launch self-heals. The human-facing *paste* prompt (resumed in an
already-loaded session, no race) stays short and omits the clause.

This split follows the repo-wide
[`primitives below, orchestration above`](../../docs/patterns/README.md)
invariant: agent-worktrees provides the lower-level session/worktree mechanisms,
while context-handoff composes the handoff policy above them.

## Standalone and degraded modes

The plugin remains useful in a plain Copilot CLI session with only
`context-handoff@copilot-extensions` enabled:

- `generate_handoff_prompt` and `save_handoff_prompt` work without
  agent-dispatch. Herdr sessions use checkout-scoped context-handoff state;
  other sessions use agent-worktrees when it can resolve a worktree state
  directory.
- If `agent-dispatch` is absent or unhealthy, `save_handoff_prompt` writes a
  one-time file outside the repo checkout. Herdr stores it under
  `~/.copilot/context-handoff/checkouts/<checkout>/handoff/` without requiring
  agent-worktrees, using the current pane cwd as `<checkout>`. Linked worktrees
  and adopted anchors outside Herdr keep their existing agent-worktrees state
  namespaces.
- File consumption uses an atomic claim. A dead consumer's claim is recoverable,
  and a retry from the same successor session can recover delivery after the
  durable spent mark; another session still receives the one-time stop notice.
- `continue_handoff` is best-effort. Herdr launches one sibling through
  `copilot-pane`; after successful consumption, the successor verifies the
  recorded predecessor pane/session and stops that exact pane. A linked worktree otherwise
  targets its `wt-<id>` mux; an adopted anchor targets the exact caller-owned
  mux containing the predecessor pane. Without a live pane host it does nothing
  destructive and tells the agent to use the saved paste or `/resume-handoff`
  fallback.
- `/resume-handoff` first tries a pinned agent-dispatch handoff task when that
  stack is available; otherwise it falls back to the newest unconsumed
  checkout-scoped handoff file for the current CWD.

For a **natural-language** resume request handled by the skill (for example,
"resume from handoff" without an exact id), discovery is deliberately
checkout-local first: resolve `agent-worktrees get worktree-state-dir`, consume
the newest valid unconsumed file under its `handoff/` directory, then inspect
the worktree's local disposition history (when the checkout is a linked
worktree) for an exact task-backed handoff pointer. The same first step works
after restarting in an adopted anchor because its `@anchor` state namespace is
stable. A broader agent-dispatch list is only a fallback and must be filtered
to the current worktree before selecting a task; cross-session history is last.

### The `handoff-cli.mjs` fallback (extension didn't load at all)

Everything above assumes the **extension is loaded** so its tools exist. When it
is **not** — most importantly a **Bare-resumed session**, where the CLI loads no
extensions at all (`extensions list` shows nothing, so there are no
`*_handoff` tools) — the plugin's **payload files are still on disk**, so an
agent can drive the identical store + live-cutover through a standalone Node CLI:

```bash
CH="$HOME/.copilot/installed-plugins/copilot-extensions/context-handoff/extensions/context-handoff/handoff-cli.mjs"
node "$CH" cutover  --title "<topic>" --prompt-file <handoff.md>   # store + live cutover
node "$CH" save     --title "<topic>" --prompt-file <handoff.md>   # store + paste prompt (no cutover)
node "$CH" continue --seed "<HANDOFF_SEED>"                         # trigger a cutover for a seed
node "$CH" consume  --handoff-id <id>                               # load a file handoff + mark consumed
```

The CLI is a thin wrapper over **`handoff-core.mjs`** — the SDK-free store/trigger
core (same on-disk format, Herdr-first and mux-preserving cutover selection, same
issue-#853 bash-first seed shape from `cutover-seed.mjs`). A handoff it stores is
therefore byte-compatible with `consume_handoff` / `/resume-handoff`. Session id
defaults to `$COPILOT_AGENT_SESSION_ID`; `--session-id`/`--cwd` override; `--no-task`
forces the file store; `--json` emits a machine-readable result. The agent
composes the handoff markdown itself (the extension's in-memory session facts —
token counts, per-turn edits — are unavailable out-of-band).

> **Module layout.** `cutover-seed.mjs` (pure seed builders) and
> `handoff-core.mjs` (SDK-free store/trigger) are both importable without loading
