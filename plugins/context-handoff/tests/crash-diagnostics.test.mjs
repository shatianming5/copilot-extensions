// Subprocess tests for crash-diagnostics.mjs: exercises the real
// process.on('uncaughtException'/'unhandledRejection'/'exit'/'SIGTERM'/
// 'SIGINT'/'SIGHUP') lifecycle handlers and asserts both the durable log
// content and the actual process exit status. Each scenario runs in its own
// child process (tests/fixtures/crash-diagnostics-harness.mjs) -- never in
// the shared `node --test` runner process, since these handlers call
// process.exit() by design.
//
// This file has two tiers, both run by the required `guards + lint` CI
// lane's unconditional `plugins/*/tests/*.test.mjs` glob (`ci.yml`) for
// every PR in the whole monorepo, not just ones that touch
// context-handoff:
//
// - A small, always-run smoke contract: the cheap subprocess cases (clean
//   exit, uncaught exception, unhandled rejection, a hostile-getter thrown
//   value, a failure after markReady(), a non-zero exit with no preceding
//   failure, SIGTERM) plus the always-run, non-subprocess production
//   wiring contract test. None of these need a POSIX toolchain beyond
//   spawning `node` itself.
// - A stress-gated set behind `CONTEXT_HANDOFF_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS_STRESS`:
//   the world-readable-file/symlink/FIFO attack simulations (the FIFO case
//   needs a real `mkfifo` binary) and the 1 MiB rotation-fixture case.
//   These are either meaningfully more expensive or add a POSIX-toolchain
//   dependency no other required-CI test here needs, so they are reserved
//   for the scheduled/manual `crash-diagnostics-stress.yml` workflow
//   (mirroring `INSTALLATION_CONTEXT_EXHAUSTIVE_ADAPTERS`'s existing
//   scheduled/manual-only pattern -- see
//   `.github/workflows/installation-context-full.yml`) rather than ever
//   running in required PR CI, regardless of what a given PR touches (an
//   earlier revision of this PR instead had `ci.yml` set the stress env var
//   whenever a PR's diff touched `plugins/context-handoff/`, giving this
//   plugin's own PRs the full stress set in required CI -- per review,
//   that still put a subprocess-heavy matrix in the required lane instead
//   of using a focused/scheduled split, so it was removed in favor of this
//   simpler two-tier design).
