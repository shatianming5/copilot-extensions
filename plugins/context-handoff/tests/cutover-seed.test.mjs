// cutover-seed.test.mjs -- unit tests for the live-cutover seed builders.
//
// Run: node --test  (from plugins/context-handoff/, or point at this file)
//
// These guard the load-bearing invariant behind GitHub issue #853: a
// legacy TASK-backed cutover seed with a known predecessor pane / worktree / session
// must be BASH-FIRST -- the successor's first actionable step is a core `bash`
// command chain, NOT the `consume_handoff` extension tool -- so the successor
// cannot be orphaned by the CLI's startup extension-reload race. The tool-based
// seed is also required for native state restoration before retirement, and for
// file-backed handoffs or when the pane/worktree/session are unknown.
