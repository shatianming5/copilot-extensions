// Emergency crash diagnostics: an isolated module with no
// `@github/copilot-sdk` dependency, so it can be exercised directly by
// subprocess tests without mocking `joinSession()`.
//
// `extension.mjs` has been observed, on at least one host, reaching the
// harness's readiness state (successful tool registration over the
// `joinSession` IPC channel) and then terminating with exit code 1 and NO
// captured stderr -- repeatedly, across many sessions over an extended
// period. No process-level `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection`/`exit`
// handlers existed anywhere in that file, so whatever Node would normally
// print for a crash was never captured.
//
// `installEmergencyDiagnostics` writes a synchronous, durable diagnostic
// line to a fixed `os.tmpdir()` path the instant anything goes wrong, so the
// next crash leaves an actual error message/stack behind instead of a bare
// exit code -- and the presence/absence of a logged non-zero `exit` line
// (routine `code=0` exits are never logged; see the rationale beside
// `onExit` below) pinpoints whether Node itself decided to terminate
// (uncaught exception, rejected top-level await) or something external
// force-killed the process before Node's own exit handling could run (no
// line is ever written in that case, since SIGKILL and an external
// process-tree kill bypass it entirely).

 * `ready=true` instead of the default `ready=false`; `uninstall()` removes
 * exactly the listeners this call added, so a test (or any future caller

 * installed elsewhere.
 *
 * Registering `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` listeners suppresses
 * Node's own default auto-exit-on-crash behavior; each handler re-exits
 * explicitly (status 1, matching what Node's default handling already did)
 * to preserve the process's prior termination behavior exactly -- this is
 * visibility, not a behavior change.
 *
 * Signal handlers do NOT call `process.exit()`: on POSIX, a parent process
 * distinguishes a signal-terminated child (`code=null, signal="SIGTERM"`)
 * from a normal exit (`code=<n>, signal=null`), and a host that inspects
 * this may classify or retry the two differently. Converting a signal into
 * `process.exit(128 + signum)` would report a normal exit and silently
 * change that contract. Instead, each handler logs, removes its own
 * listener for that one signal (so the re-raise below cannot recurse into
 * this same handler), and re-sends the identical signal to this process.
 * With no listener left for it, the OS's default disposition applies and
 * genuinely terminates the process by that signal -- Node then reports the
 * same `(code=null, signal=<signal>)` shape a parent would have seen with no
 * diagnostics installed at all.
