// (see handoff-core.mjs's formatConsumeResult/buildResumePrompt). A session
// that did NOT start from a handoff instead learns the mechanism exists from
// the static, hookless session-start guidance (scripts/emit-guidance.*, via
// write_session_guidance.py), not from this extension: that guidance is
// naturally idempotent (a plain file rewrite) and delivered exactly once per
// real session start, unlike a runtime session.send() nudge queued from
// extension.mjs's top-level module state -- that module is reimported on
// every reconnect/refork, so an in-memory "sent once" guard there is not
// idempotent across a session's real lifetime. See
// efforts/active/context-handoff-overhaul's journal for the incident this
// design avoids (a mid-session reload replayed the nudge and raced the
// skill registry).
