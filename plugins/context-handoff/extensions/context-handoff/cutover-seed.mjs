// cutover-seed.mjs -- pure builders for the live-cutover successor's seed prompt.
//
// Extracted from extension.mjs so the seed SHAPE is independently testable
// (unit test + clean-room import) without loading the whole session extension
// (which pulls in the Copilot SDK). Everything here is a pure string function
// with no side effects, no SDK, and no module state -- import it from anywhere.
//
// The load-bearing invariant these functions encode: for a TASK-backed cutover
// with a known predecessor pane / worktree / session, the successor's FIRST
// action is a plain shell-command chain (a CORE `bash` call), NOT the
// `consume_handoff` extension tool. That is what makes the successor immune to
// the CLI's startup extension-reload race (see GitHub issue #853): an
// extension-provided tool call can be orphaned when the extension generation
// servicing it is torn down mid-launch (no completion, no error -> the call
// hangs indefinitely), whereas a core `bash` call cannot.

// Normalize a handoff title into the seed's leading topic clause. Copilot's
// inferred session title is biased toward the beginning of the first prompt, so
// lead with the actual task title rather than generic handoff/resume wording.
// Strip prefixes inherited from older handoffs before adding the stable marker.

// Build the single-line ASCII CUTOVER seed (the HANDOFF_SEED) for a live
// cutover successor. Kept as the ONE source of this string so
// save_handoff_prompt and retry_handoff_cutover always spawn an identical
// successor. `kind` is "task" (agent-dispatch task-backed) or "file"
// (machine-local file-backed); `id` is the task id / file handoff id; `lead`
// comes from `leadFrom(title)`.
//
// For a TASK-backed cutover we prefer a BASH-FIRST seed (see GitHub issue #853):
// the successor's first action is a plain shell-command chain, NOT the
// `consume_handoff` extension tool. The CLI's startup extension-reload race can
// route an external-tool request to an extension generation that is torn down
// mid-launch; the request then never returns -- no completion event, no error --
// and the tool call hangs indefinitely (observed: multi-hour stalls). The `bash`
// tool is a CORE tool (not extension-provided), so it cannot be orphaned that
// way. The retry-on-not-ready clause below was an earlier mitigation, but it
// only helps when the bad call fails FAST (a 400 / tool-not-found the model can
// see and retry) -- it does nothing for the silent-hang case, which is why the
// bash-first path exists. The bash-first seed is used only when the predecessor
// pane / worktree / cwd / session id are known (`oldPane`, `worktree`,
// `worktreeDir`, `sessionId`); otherwise, and for file-backed handoffs, we fall
// back to the tool-based seed + retry clause. A task carrying native session
// state also uses the tool-based seed because consume_handoff must restore that
// state before predecessor retirement.
//
// `retry` (default true) appends the retry-on-not-ready clause described above.
// Pass `retry: false` for the human-facing paste prompt (resumed in an
// already-loaded session, where there is no such race and brevity matters).
