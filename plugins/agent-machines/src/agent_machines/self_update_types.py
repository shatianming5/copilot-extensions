"""Shared result types and process-invocation helpers for unattended self-update.

Kept as a dependency-free leaf module (stdlib + ``agent_procutil`` only) so
both ``self_update.py`` (tier orchestration) and ``self_update_dtssh.py``
(dtssh host/mesh liveness) can depend on it without creating an import cycle
between those two.
