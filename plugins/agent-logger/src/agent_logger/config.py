"""Layered configuration for agent-logger.

Resolution order (lowest precedence first):

1. Built-in defaults (:data:`DEFAULTS`).
2. ``$AGENT_LOGGER_HOME/config.yaml`` (or ``~/.agent-logger/config.yaml``).
3. Repository-local organization config (``.agent-logger.yaml`` by convention).
4. Environment-variable overrides (``AGENT_LOGGER_*``).

Everything that couples the reusable code to a particular multi-machine system -- the
digest store location, the sync target, the voice pack, the output path
template, machine naming, and the session-note marker -- lives here as
configuration with neutral defaults.

    different sync target type, change machine identity, or touch anything
    credential-bearing.

    This relaxation exists because the alternative -- requiring every
    machine to hand-author its own copy of a value that must be identical
    everywhere -- is exactly the drift this field closes: confirmed live
    across two real machines before this field existed, one had the wrong
    path (contradicting its own adjacent comment) and the other had no
    sync config file at all, silently syncing to a useless local-only
    default for its entire lifetime.

    **Forward compatibility (rolling updates).** A config written for a *newer*
    schema than this build supports is read **tolerantly** -- top-level,
    ``log``, and ``sync`` fields this version does not recognize are ignored
    rather than fatal -- so a fleet mid-upgrade never has an older reader
    hard-fail on a config a newer machine committed. A config at or below
    this build's schema is validated **strictly** (unknown fields are a typo
    and raise). This is why growing the schema is a version bump, not a
    breaking change.
