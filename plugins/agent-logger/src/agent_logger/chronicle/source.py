"""The **session-source** seam of the background chronicler.

This seam answers three questions the daemon must ask before it logs anything,
each of which maps to a work-locking invariant in the chronicler compatibility
contract:

* **What is loggable right now?** :meth:`SessionSource.scan` discovers sessions
  from the synced corpus, applying the **settle gate** (I4): a session synced
  more recently than ``settle_seconds`` is mid-sync and must not be claimed.
* **What have we already logged?** :meth:`SessionSource.is_journaled` is the
  **already-journaled skip predicate** (I4): idempotent under catch-up replays,
  so a multi-day gap never re-files a day that was already chronicled.
* **Can this unit fence the segments it will log?** :class:`ReservationStore`
  is the **continuation-segment reservation** (I2 -- the highest-risk lock).
  The work-locked mesh fences a task *record* (atomic claim + unique dedup_key)
  but does **not** fence a task's *inputs*; the session segments live outside
  the mesh, so the reservation table is carried here, in the source seam. A
  chronicle unit reserves the exact ``(parent_session_id, segment_index)``
  segments it will log via a compare-and-set; a racing digest pass that finds a
  segment already reserved reserves nothing for it, and a downgrade guard never
  moves a journaled segment back to available.

The mesh task's dedup key and the reservation key are derived from the **same**
identity -- :func:`chronicle_dedup_key` and :attr:`SegmentRef.key` both key on
``(parent_session_id, segment_index)`` -- so the create-time dedup fence and the
reservation-CAS fence can never disagree about "same segment".

:class:`SyncedSessionSource` is the reference implementation over the local
synced corpus (``<sync-root>/<machine>/session-state/<id>/``). Consumers with a
different corpus (e.g. a NAS-mounted fleet share) subclass :class:`SessionSource`
or point the reference impl at a different root.
