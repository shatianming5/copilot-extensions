"""On-device cold-session compaction (session-sync WS2).

Selects *cold* sessions in the local Copilot state dir -- at least
``min_age_days`` old and not tied to an active worktree -- compresses each into
the agent-logger archive store (``<home>/archived-sessions/`` by default, kept
**outside** ``~/.copilot`` so it survives CLI session rotation), and reclaims
the live ``session-state/<id>/`` directory once the archive is verified.

This is the "second copy source" in the two-pair sync model: compaction moves a

compressed source (the archive store), which sync then carries to the hub.
