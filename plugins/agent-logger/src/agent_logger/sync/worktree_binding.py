"""Worktree-binding derivation + sidecar marking (session-worktree-archive
-linkout Phase 3, private-downstream-repo).

Mirrors :mod:`agent_logger.sync.origin` exactly: a per-session-dir sidecar
(``worktree.json``) that syncs with the session, so a downstream consumer
(Permanent Record's archive-side worktree correlation) can read an
**authoritative** ``worktree_id`` written at sync time -- while the live
``agent-worktrees`` binding for that session was still available on the
machine that ran it -- rather than reconstructing one after the fact from a
best-effort CWD-pattern match against an archived, possibly-gone worktree.

This closes the loop for **future** sessions only. Permanent Record's own
``correlate_cwd()`` reconstruction pass
(``efforts/active/session-worktree-archive-linkout`` Phase 1, private-downstream-repo)
remains the one-time (plus ongoing best-effort) backfill for **past**
sessions synced before this module existed.

``agent-worktrees`` is a **soft** dependency, resolved lazily and only at the
point of use -- mirroring the same optional cross-plugin import
``agent_codespaces.config._registered_repo_paths`` already uses for
``agent_worktrees.repos``. agent-logger's own ``pyproject.toml`` does not (and
should not) declare a hard dependency on a sibling plugin; a machine that
happens to have both installed (the normal facility case) gets proactive
worktree binding, one that has only agent-logger degrades to a no-op sidecar
absence, not an error.
