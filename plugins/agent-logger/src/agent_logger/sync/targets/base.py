"""Target abstraction for session-sync.

A *target* is a destination for raw Copilot session data. Every target
takes a local source tree and publishes it under a per-machine subpath,
so any consumer (a local orchestrator, a fleet hub, or a bespoke service)
sees the same ``{machine}/...`` layout regardless of transport.

Concrete targets:

- :class:`~agent_logger.sync.targets.filesystem.LocalTarget` -- a dotfolder
  under ``$HOME`` (default, zero-dependency).
- :class:`~agent_logger.sync.targets.filesystem.OneDriveTarget` -- a
  subfolder under the resolved OneDrive root (fleet hub without a NAS).
- :class:`~agent_logger.sync.targets.ssh.SshTarget` -- rsync/ssh to an
  arbitrary ``user@host:path`` (optionally via a jump host).
- :class:`~agent_logger.sync.targets.ingest.IngestTarget` -- an rsync-daemon
  sink with an optional HTTP notify (the shape a processing service exposes).
