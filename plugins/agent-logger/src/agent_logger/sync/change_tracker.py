"""Durable local session-signature tracking for incremental sync.

Re-walking and re-diffing the entire session-state tree on every scheduled
push is expensive once the corpus grows large -- especially when the
transport crosses a slow filesystem bridge (e.g. WSL's DrvFS view of a
Windows path), where even a no-op rsync invocation that only *compares*
mtimes/sizes can take long enough to exceed the engine's own subprocess
timeout. This module keeps a small local SQLite record of each session's
last-synced content signature, computed from local, native file stats only
(never rsync, never the network), so a routine run can cheaply ask "what
actually changed since last time?" and hand the target only that narrow set
via ``Target.push(..., include_sessions=...)``.

This is a *local* optimization, never a second source of truth: the
destination is always authoritative. A periodic full reconciliation pass
(see :func:`ChangeTracker.should_full_sync`) and the explicit ``run --full``
escape hatch exist precisely so local drift (a corrupted/stale tracker db,
or a change this signature scheme itself can't see -- e.g. a session the
tracker never knew about) is never permanent. This is a stat-based
signature, the same bound every target's own transport already accepts
(rsync without ``--checksum``, this module's own size/mtime compare): a
file whose *content* changes while its size and mtime are both deliberately
restored to their prior values is invisible to this scheme and to the
underlying transport alike, full reconciliation included -- see the
``session-sync-setup`` skill's "Change tracking" section for the operator
workflow.
