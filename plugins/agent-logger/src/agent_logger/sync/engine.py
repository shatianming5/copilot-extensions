"""session-sync -- push raw Copilot session data to a configurable target.

A thin, cross-platform engine: it discovers the local session source, takes a
serialized lock, dispatches to the configured :mod:`~agent_logger.sync.targets`
target, optionally prunes the destination, and reports status. The transport
specifics live in the target classes -- the engine itself is transport-blind.

Console script: ``session-sync`` (see pyproject ``[project.scripts]``).
