"""Detached, update-safe launcher for the session-end sync.

The ``sessionEnd`` hook fires a background sync when a Copilot session ends.
Two problems come with launching that process naively from the hook:

1. **cwd pinning.** A process started by the hook inherits the *ending
   session's* working directory -- a worktree. On Windows a live process
   holding a handle on that directory blocks the worktree from being pruned
   ("directory in use").

2. **Self-update collision.** The sync runs as the agent-logger venv's
   ``python -m agent_logger.sync.engine``. If agent-logger is updated while a
   sync is in flight, the installer reinstalls (and sometimes rebuilds) that
   venv and the ``agent_logger`` package under it -- on Windows a running
   interpreter locks those files, so the update and the sync collide.

This module addresses both by *staging* the ``agent_logger`` package into a
throwaway OS-temp directory and launching a fully **detached** child that runs
the sync from there, with its cwd set to that temp dir (never the worktree,
never the install). Because the child imports the *staged* copy of the package
(via ``PYTHONPATH``), an agent-logger reinstall underneath it cannot swap the
code out from under a running sync; third-party dependencies still resolve from
the venv's ``site-packages`` (which an agent-logger update does not touch).

The parent (the process the hook launches) only stages + spawns, then exits
immediately, so it holds the venv for a fraction of a second. A non-blocking
probe of the existing push lock deduplicates rapid session-ends: if a sync is
already running, we skip staging entirely. The child cleans up its own staging
directory on exit; stale directories from a crashed child are swept on the next
spawn.
