"""Registered-project trust gate for repo-local config discovery.

Repo-local config lets a *checked-in file* hand this machine directives --
where to sync session data, how to write logs, what schema fields to trust.
Reading that file from an arbitrary local checkout would let anyone who gets
us to `git clone` their repo (e.g. a public repo crafted to look interesting,
with our own config filenames planted in it) redirect a facility machine's
behavior without a human ever having reviewed or approved that repo.

The trust boundary is therefore: repo-local config is honored ONLY for a
checkout of a repo the operator has explicitly *registered* as a known
project (``agent-worktrees repos add`` -- an affirmative, one-time decision,
never silently inferred from "someone cloned this locally"), and only when
that checkout's current branch is the repo's registered ``default_branch``
(never an arbitrary feature/PR branch, which could carry an unreviewed
config change). Both checks fail *safe*: any ambiguity (no remote, no
registry entry, detached HEAD, registry unreadable) is treated as
"untrusted", which simply means repo-local config is treated as absent --
never an error, since plenty of legitimate checkouts (a fresh clone with no
committed config at all) look the same from here.
