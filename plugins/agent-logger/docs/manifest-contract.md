# Manifest contract & the closing-remark seam

The `session-log-writer` agent is driven entirely by a **manifest** -- a JSON
file whose path the caller passes in the spawn prompt. Three callers produce
this same manifest: the `log-session` skill (interactive, one session), the
`process-backlog` skill (local batch), and a chronicle runner (fleet/day
digest). The chronicle CLI's default writer only persists the `mode: digest`
manifest JSON; a host runner still has to spawn the writer agent to render a
log.

## Schema

```json
{
  "mode": "single | batch | digest",
  "return": "result | json",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc-123",
      "machine": "workstation",
      "session_path": "/abs/path/to/session-state/abc-123",
      "repository": "owner/repo",
      "branch": "main",
      "summary": "optional brief summary",
      "created_at": "2026-04-25T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:30:00Z",
      "existing_log_path": "logs/2026/.../Title.md"
    }
  ],
  "output_root": "logs",
  "target_log_path": null,
  "log_path_template": "{year}/{month}/{day} {hhmmss} {title}.md",
  "timezone": null,
  "note_marker": "SESSION NOTE:",
  "log_template": null,
  "narration_style": null,
  "exemplars": null,
  "closing_remark": null
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `mode` | yes | `single` renders the one session; `batch` triages + renders many; `digest` collapses a day's sessions into **one** compact daily log (background chronicle). |
| `return` | yes | `result` = marker-delimited artifacts; `json` = machine-parseable render bundle. |
| `sessions[].session_id` | yes | Session UUID. |
| `sessions[].machine` | yes | Base machine name (no `-wsl`); used in paths/frontmatter. |
| `sessions[].session_path` | yes | Collation source -- an absolute path the segmenter can read. |
| `sessions[].repository` / `branch` / `summary` / `created_at` / `updated_at` | no | Metadata for frontmatter and triage. |
| `sessions[].existing_log_path` | no | A pre-existing log to skip / supplement / promote. |
| `output_root` | yes | Root dir for emitted logs. |
| `target_log_path` | no | Exact caller-prepared path for `single` mode. When present, the renderer uses it verbatim instead of deriving a path. |
| `log_path_template` | no | Defaults to the agent-logger config template. Tokens: `{year} {month} {day} {hhmmss} {machine} {title}`. |
| `timezone` | no | IANA tz for timestamps; `null` = system local. |
| `note_marker` | no | Operator-note marker prefix (default `SESSION NOTE:`). |
| `log_template` | no | Optional Markdown skeleton/instructions from repo-local config. `null` = use the built-in structured-frontmatter log. |
| `narration_style` | no | `null` (default) or caller-injected instructions for **interleaved** personality woven through the narrative body (primary voice seam). |
| `exemplars` | no | `null` (default) or a list of short few-shot tone/depth reference passages (or a path to them). |
| `closing_remark` | no | `null` (default) or caller-injected instructions for an **end-of-log** sign-off (end-only complement to `narration_style`). |

## The daily-digest manifest (`mode: digest`)

The background chronicler (`agent_logger.chronicle`) produces a **distinct**
manifest shape: one compact **daily** log per `(sink, day)`, not one log per
session. It sets `mode: "digest"` and adds three fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `digest_date` | The `YYYY-MM-DD` day the listed sessions are chronicled under. |
| `sink` | The routed sink id (target harness repo) this digest lands in. |
| `digest_template` | The compact daily-digest body template — **distinct** from the per-session `Summary / Key-Changes / Commits / Open-Items` shape. Tokens: `{date} {machine} {sink} {session_count} {sessions}`. |
| `sessions[].segment_ref` | The `<parent_session_id>:<segment_index>` identity the daemon reserved for this unit (the reservation/dedup identity). |

The writer renders **one** log for the whole day from `digest_template`, listing
the day's sessions tersely. The voice seam is unchanged: `narration_style`
defaults to the resolved **objective** instruction (neutral, factual — the
retrieval-corpus baseline); a consumer sink may set it to voice-skill
instructions to layer a character voice on its own target. `exemplars` and
`closing_remark` behave exactly as in the per-session contract.

```json
{
  "mode": "digest",
  "return": "json",
  "digest_date": "2026-07-28",
  "sink": "project-logs",
  "sessions": [
    {"session_id": "abc-123", "machine": "book2",
     "session_path": "/…/sessions/book2/session-state/abc-123",
     "repository": "owner/project", "segment_ref": "abc-123:0"}
  ],
  "output_root": "logs",
  "log_path_template": "{year}/{month}/{day} chronicle.md",
  "narration_style": "Write in an objective, matter-of-fact chronicle voice: …",
  "digest_template": "# Chronicle -- {date}\n\n**Sink:** {sink}\n…"
}
```

## Output contract

The custom sub-agent is a **read-only renderer**. This is intentional: the
runtime may apply a higher-priority no-file-output policy to custom sub-agents.
The caller validates each target against `output_root`, persists the complete
body with its own authorized file-edit tool, and only then reports or lands it.

- `return: result` -- the agent returns marker-delimited artifact blocks with
  path, `create|append` action, session id, a per-artifact random boundary, and
  complete Markdown body or append-only delta. Append artifacts also carry the
  SHA-256 of the existing file the renderer read. Used by interactive callers.
- `return: json` -- the agent prints a JSON render bundle. Each successful
  result carries `category`, `log_path`, `action` (`create|append`), `content`,
  append-only `base_sha256`, and
  `status: "rendered"`; counts use `logs_rendered`. Used by batch/service
  callers, which must persist the bundle before applying their landing policy.

Callers enforce action semantics: `create` refuses an existing target, while
`append` requires an existing target and a matching SHA-256 immediately before
mutation. Standalone append targets match a manifest-supplied
`existing_log_path`; grouped daily digests may append to their derived,
path-validated digest target. Callers resolve and validate every path beneath
`output_root`; renderer output is never trusted as a path authority.

## The voice seam (how voice is injected)

**The agent has no personality of its own.** Voice is injected through three
optional, null-by-default fields. The generic skills copy them from repository
organization config; when all are null the agent writes a plain log with no
remark, quip, or persona.

| Field | Where the voice lands |
|-------|-----------------------|
| `narration_style` | **Interleaved** through the narrative body -- asides and character beats *between* thematic passages. The primary seam. |
| `closing_remark` | A single **end-of-log** sign-off after a trailing `---`. The simple, end-only complement. |
| `exemplars` | Few-shot **tone samples** that inform the writing (not copied). |

This is the single, deliberate seam through which a repository adds voice
**without the plugin ever containing one**. To inject a persona:

1. The host owns a **voice skill** (its character/quip rules) in its own
   repo -- not in this plugin.
2. The repository's organization config sets `narration_style` (and optionally
   `exemplars` and/or `closing_remark`) to the voice skill's instructions --
   e.g. a
   directive like *"Consult the `my-voice` skill; weave brief in-character
   asides between thematic sections where they add warmth or wit, never
   forced; then close with a 2-3 line sign-off."*
3. The agent weaves `narration_style` through the body, emulates any
   `exemplars` for tone, and appends any `closing_remark` after a `---`
   separator in each standalone log.

Without repository configuration all three fields remain null, so out of the
box every log is persona-free. Only a repository that deliberately supplies
instructions gets styled output.

## Repo-local organization config

The interactive `prepare-session-log --json` helper layers a repo-local
organization config on top of machine-local defaults. A repository may commit
one of these files at its git root:

- `.agent-logger.yaml`
- `.agent-logger.yml`
- `.config/agent-logger.yaml`
- `.config/agent-logger.yml`

Only the `log:` block, plus schema v3's single `sync.local_path` field (see
below), is honored from repo-local config. This lets a repository choose its
own output tree and Markdown skeleton, and declare the one facility-wide
sync destination, without letting a checkout change any other machine-local
sync behavior (target type, credentials, machine identity).

Example:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
log:
  root: .
  path_template: "logs/{year}/{month}.{day} {title}.md"
  template: |
    # {title}

    **Date:** {date}
    **Branch(es):** {branches}
    **PR(s):** {prs}

    ## Summary

    {summary}

    ## Key Changes

    {key_changes}

    ## Commits

    {commits}

    ## Open Items

    {open_items}
  narration_style: null
  exemplars: null
  closing_remark: "End with one concise takeaway."
```

The writer treats `log_template` as the repository's complete standalone-log
contract: it fills placeholders with real session values and preserves the
requested section order. It does not add built-in YAML frontmatter unless the
template asks for it. Leave `log_template` null for the backward-compatible
built-in body organization and frontmatter. The same `log:` block may supply
`narration_style`, `exemplars`, and `closing_remark`;
`prepare-session-log --json` and `agent-logger organization` copy them into
the manifest unchanged, eliminating wrapper-only injection.

`schema_version` may be omitted, in which case it is treated as the current
schema this build supports (3 as of this release) -- so an unversioned file
already gets full access to `sync.local_path`, not just `log:`. The loader
rejects unsupported versions, malformed YAML, unknown fields/placeholders,
invalid timezones, and output paths that are absolute or escape the
repository. Repo-local config accepts only `root`, `path_template`,
`timezone`, `note_marker`, `template`, `narration_style`, `exemplars`, and
`closing_remark` under `log:`; as of schema v3 it additionally accepts a
single `sync.local_path` (an absolute path, e.g. a shared NAS mount) -- the
one sync setting that is genuinely the same value for every machine in the
fleet. Everything else about sync (which target is active, credentials,
machine identity) stays machine-local and cannot be set from a repo.

**`sync.local_path`'s platform-neutral syntax (non-empty, no `~`, absolute on
*some* platform's syntax, no `..`) is validated eagerly on every target, the
same as always.** Only the final *host-native* absoluteness check -- whether
a value that already passed those checks is absolute on *this specific*
platform -- is deferred until a machine's own resolved `sync.target` is
known, since a mixed Windows/POSIX fleet has no single string that's a
native absolute path on every platform. On a machine whose own target is
`local`, a value foreign to this platform still fails the whole config load
(the same strict check as always, since `Config.sync_path` would otherwise
risk silently resolving it as relative). On any other target, a foreign
value is inapplicable there and is quietly dropped back to that machine's
own `sync.targets.local.path` (or the default) instead of failing the load
over a value it never consumes.

```yaml
schema_version: 3
sync:
  local_path: /mnt/nas/Lake/Copilot/sessions
```

### Trust gate: only a registered project's default branch is honored

Repo-local config is only read from a checkout that is BOTH a project the
operator has explicitly registered with `agent-worktrees` (matched by git
remote URL against agent-worktrees' `repos.yaml`, honoring `$AGENT_HOME`
just like agent-worktrees' own legacy registry-root resolution) AND
currently checked out on that project's registered `default_branch`. An
arbitrary local clone, or a registered repo's feature/PR branch, gets no
repo-local config at all -- silently, never an error -- so a checkout can't
redirect a facility machine's sync destination or log layout just by
existing locally or by an unreviewed
branch. See `agent_logger/repo_trust.py` for the exact resolution logic and
the `$AGENT_LOGGER_TRUST_REPO_CONFIG` machine-local override.

**Interleaved vs. end-only.** `narration_style` exists precisely so voice
need not be *"jammed at the end"* -- a host that wants personality *woven
through* the narrative sets `narration_style`; a host that only wants a brief
sign-off sets `closing_remark`; a host that wants both sets both.

## Example: interactive single session

```json
{
  "mode": "single",
  "return": "result",
  "sessions": [
    {"session_id": "abc-123", "machine": "workstation",
     "session_path": "/home/u/.copilot/session-state/abc-123"}
  ],
  "output_root": "logs",
  "target_log_path": "/home/u/project/logs/2026/04.25 Example.md",
  "closing_remark": null
}
```

## Example: batch with repository-configured voice

```json
{
  "mode": "batch",
  "return": "json",
  "sessions": [ /* ...N sessions... */ ],
  "output_root": "logs",
  "narration_style": "Consult your narration voice skill. Weave brief in-character asides between thematic sections where they add warmth or wit -- interleaved, never forced, never all at the end.",
  "exemplars": "docs/log-style-exemplars.md",
  "closing_remark": null
}
```
