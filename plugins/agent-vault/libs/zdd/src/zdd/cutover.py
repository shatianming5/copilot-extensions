"""Active/passive cutover orchestration for zero-downtime redeploys.

This is the headline of the zero-downtime effort: stand the **new** daemon up
beside the **old** one on a fresh port, confirm it is healthy, flip the routing
table so clients follow it, drain the old daemon's in-flight work, then retire
the old daemon -- with no client ever dialing a dead port and no active turn
hard-killed.

The orchestration is **app-level and OS-agnostic** (the effort's deliberate
conclusion: systemd and Windows Scheduled Tasks share almost no lifecycle
surface, so the drain/handoff logic must not live in the service manager). All
side-effecting collaborators -- spawning the passive daemon, health probing,
the HTTP client, free-port selection -- are injected, so the sequence and its
rollback are exercised by unit tests without real subprocesses. The thin CLI
(`agent-bridge deploy`) wires the real implementations.

Sequence (each step before the commit point is reversible)::

    1. resolve the current active endpoint (routing table)         [reversible]
    2. pick a free port for the new daemon                          [reversible]
    3. spawn the passive daemon (--passive: no self-route, no relay)[reversible]
    4. wait until the new daemon is healthy                         [reversible]
    5. flip the routing table -> new active, old demoted to previous[reversible]
    6. drain the old daemon (busy-oracle wait, optional force)      [reversible]
    -- COMMIT POINT --
    7. shut the old daemon down (clean exit; systemd won't resurrect)
    8. adopt the credential relay on the new daemon (best effort)

A failure anywhere before the commit point rolls back: re-publish the old
endpoint as active, undrain the old daemon, and terminate the freshly spawned
passive. After the commit point the new daemon is the sole survivor, so
remaining steps are best-effort and never roll back.
