"""agent-vault extension: reach a wired *core* over the core-delegation seam.

agent-vault's installed daemon is a light **custody adapter**. When a heavy
**core** is wired -- a remote engine or a container running agent-vault's
own daemon protocol -- this extension lets the CLI reach it as just another client
transport, discovered and dialed by the generic ``core-delegation`` primitive.

It registers a **fallback** transport (consulted only after the built-in
unix-socket / named-pipe / TCP transports), so:

- **No core wired** (no ``AGENT_VAULT_CORE_ENDPOINT`` and no core rendezvous
  file) -> :func:`core_transport` returns ``None`` and nothing changes: the local
  daemon / user-mode path handles the request. This preserves
  ``visions/plugin-services`` §standalone-reachability -- agent-vault never
  *requires* a core.
- **A local daemon is handling the request** -> the built-ins succeed first and
  this transport is never consulted.
- **A core is wired and the local daemon is absent** -> the request is delegated
  to the core over a tokened, newline-framed JSON channel.

Wiring a core is opt-in configuration:

- ``AGENT_VAULT_CORE_ENDPOINT`` -- an explicit ``"<transport>:<address>"`` spec
  (e.g. ``"tcp:127.0.0.1:52731"`` or ``"unix:/path/core.sock"``), or leave it
  unset and let the core advertise itself via a rendezvous file under the core
  runtime dir.
- ``AGENT_VAULT_CORE_TOKEN`` -- an optional bearer token attached to each
  delegated request (token-bind); a core that enforces it validates it, one that
  does not ignores it.

The core runtime dir is deliberately **distinct** from the local daemon's
``~/.agent-vault/run`` so discovery resolves the *core*, not the local daemon
(which the built-in transports already reach).
