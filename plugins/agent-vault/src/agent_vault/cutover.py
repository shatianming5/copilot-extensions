"""Drain-safe cutover: hand off the unlocked master secret between generations.

A routine vault version bump replaces the running daemon. Today that hard-restart
drops the in-memory unlocked master password(s) and the warm credential cache,
forcing the operator to re-unlock. The drain-safe cutover (#743) instead stands up
the new generation, has it **inherit the unlocked state from the outgoing one**,
flips the routing record, and drains the old daemon -- so a version bump costs no
re-unlock.

This module is the *mechanism*: it builds and applies the minimal handoff payload.
The payload carries the unlocked master password(s) in plaintext, so it is
**security-critical** and bound by the invariants in ``docs/architecture.md``.
The handoff crosses TWO distinct legs, each gated differently:

1. **Outgoing daemon -> installer** (`request_handoff_from_running_daemon` /
   the `handoff-export` daemon action): ONLY over a transport we can prove is
   access-gated to the owner -- today the vault's AF_UNIX control socket
   (``0o600``) -- and **never** plain loopback TCP or the network. The
   Windows named pipe is excluded until it carries a hardened owner-only ACL,
   and a host without a qualifying transport (Windows today, or a TCP-only
   WSL layout) safely degrades to the existing re-unlock path.
2. **Installer -> not-yet-running new generation** (`--handoff-stdin`, in
   `service.main`): this is not an inter-daemon crossing (nothing is
   listening yet) -- it is how a parent process hands data to the child it is
   about to launch, so it uses whichever same-user, non-persistent OS carrier
   the launch mechanism supports: stdin for a direct invocation, or the
   ``AGENT_VAULT_HANDOFF_JSON`` env var for a systemd-managed restart
   (`systemctl --user set-environment` immediately before, unset immediately
   after -- never written to the unit file, never persisted past that one
   restart). Neither carrier is a file and neither crosses the network.

In both legs the secret is transferred, applied, and dropped -- this module
never persists it and never logs its value.

Only what is needed to avoid a re-unlock is carried: the unlocked master
password(s) + their TTL bookkeeping. The credential-*value* cache is intentionally
left to re-warm lazily on the new generation, keeping the secret surface minimal.
