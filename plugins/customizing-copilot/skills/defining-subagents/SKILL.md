# Defining Sub-Agents

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-mcp session command catalog for MCP
fallback operations below. Replace `<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]>` with the raw
path and quote it at the shell call site on POSIX; in PowerShell invoke it as
`& "<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]>" <args>`.

Custom agents are specialized profiles Copilot can delegate to. Each runs in its
own subagent process with a separate context window. They are for **delegation**
-- not host/machine identity (which a control harness handles through its own
`AGENTS.md` / host-specific skills).

This skill owns **authoring and review**, not runtime task routing. To decide
whether the current task should be delegated, use
`delegation-guidance:delegating-work`; do not give this skill bare runtime
phrases such as `sub-agent`, `delegate`, or `which agent`.

## Locations

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| Project | `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md` or `.claude/agents/<name>.agent.md` |
| Personal | `~/.copilot/agents/<name>.agent.md` |
| Plugin | `plugins/<plugin>/agents/<name>.agent.md` (shipped by an enabled plugin) |
| In-repo plugin (`.ai`) | `.ai/<name>/agents/<name>.agent.md` — a sub-agent packaged as a plugin in the repo's own **local marketplace** (`directory` source). **Preferred** for a repo's own MCP-owning sub-agents so they travel with the repo and compose across contexts; see `installing-plugins`. |

For same-ID collisions, personal agents load before project and plugin agents,
so a personal agent overrides a project agent with the same file-derived ID.
Plugin agents cannot override personal or project agents.

> **Packaging a sub-agent as an `.ai` plugin.** A sub-agent that owns an MCP
> server (per the per-agent MCP pattern below) is a natural unit to ship as an

## Agent file format

YAML frontmatter followed by a markdown system prompt (max 30,000 chars):

````yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: |
  What this agent does and when to use it.
tools: ['shell', 'read', 'search', 'edit', 'agent', 'skill', 'ask_user']
mcp-servers:
  server-name:
    type: stdio
    command: python3
    args: ['tools/server.py']
    tools: ["*"]

# System Prompt (instructions, personality, domain knowledge)
````

### Frontmatter properties

| Property | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `description` | **yes** | Purpose and capabilities. Drives auto-delegation. |
| `name` | no | Display name (file stem used for dedup). |
| `tools` | no | Allowed tools. Omit or `["*"]` for all. |
| `model` | no | Override the default model. |
| `mcp-servers` | no | MCP servers spun up only for this agent. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | no | If `true`, no auto-delegation. |
| `user-invocable` | no | If `false`, programmatic-only. |

### Tool aliases

Standard aliases: `execute` (shell/bash/powershell), `read`, `edit`, `search`
(grep/glob), `agent` (Task), `web` (WebSearch/WebFetch), `todo`. Grant MCP server
tools with `'server-name/*'` or `'server-name/tool-name'` in the tools list.

## Invocation

- **Slash command:** `/agent` then select from the list
- **Explicit:** "Use the security-auditor agent on src/"
- **By inference:** prompt matches the agent description, Copilot auto-delegates
- **Programmatic:** `copilot --agent agent-name --prompt "..."`

> **Namespacing across plugins.** When you refer to (or delegate to) a sub-agent
> **shipped by another plugin**, use the **`plugin:name`** form — e.g.
> `agent-logger:session-log-writer` or `copilot-extensions-harness:clean-room-judge`
> — including as the `task` tool's `agent_type`. A bare name is reserved for an
> agent defined in the *same* plugin. The identical convention covers cross-plugin
> **skill** references (see the authoring-skills skill).
>
> **Known runtime limitation.** On some Copilot CLI runtime versions, the
> `task` tool's `agent_type` is validated against a fixed built-in allowlist
> with no plugin/marketplace-agent slot at all, so a delegated/background
> sub-agent cannot reach a `plugin:name` agent through `task` regardless of
> qualification, and a freshly spawned nested `copilot` process does not
> inherit the parent session's resolved `enabledPlugins` either. If a
> delegated/background sub-agent needs to reach a plugin-defined agent on an
> affected version, see **`hoisting-plugin-agents`** for a repo-local
> mechanical workaround.

## Execution contract

Author every agent to **execute its assigned scope directly** and return an
integration-ready result. Its prompt should define a bounded responsibility,
inputs, exclusions, and output shape; the agent should return compact findings,
citations, changed-file lists, and validation results rather than raw source,
tool catalogs, or verbose API payloads.

A leaf agent does not create child agents. A coordinator-style custom agent may
delegate distinct child scopes only when its definition and invocation prompt
explicitly authorize that role, but it still must not spawn another copy of
itself. The caller retains final synthesis, integration, and completion unless
the contract explicitly assigns one of those responsibilities.

## Per-agent MCP ownership

Domain or service agents that depend on MCP tools should **define those servers
in their own frontmatter** via the `mcp-servers` block. Copilot CLI starts the
server when the sub-agent is spawned and manages the lifecycle automatically.
The owning agent absorbs the service schema, authentication particulars,
verbose round trips, and raw payloads, then returns only the bounded result its
caller needs.

Project-level `.mcp.json` is reserved for servers the **main coordinator** uses
directly. Keep compact, broadly useful research and orchestration tools there
when their results support decomposition, arbitration, shared history, or task
state and delegating every lookup would cost more than it saves. Domain-specific
service catalogs and calls belong in the domain agent. For the full registration
hierarchy, see the **registering-mcp-servers** skill.

An **agent-mcp-backed** agent needs two authorization-equivalent surfaces over
one bridge config: the primary `mcp-servers` catalog and an explicit materialized
CLI fallback. Both surfaces preserve the same auth source, identity, upstream,
protocol, and top-level `tools:` allow/deny filter. Identity-affecting values
belong in the shared bridge config/overlay, **not** only in
`mcp-servers.env` (shell fallback does not inherit frontmatter-only env).

Decorator-enforced behavior is not equivalent on the one-shot CLI path today.
Static name restrictions must be duplicated in top-level `tools:`. Conditional
authorization (`gate`, or argument-dependent redaction) cannot be represented by
that filter, so those agents must not permit materialized fallback. Shape-only
decorators (`rename`, `defer`, `code-mode`, `transform`, `storage`) also vanish;
their fallback is the wider raw catalog and must be documented honestly. A raw
`curl`/HTTP/product-API bypass is never this fallback.

## Per-toolset ownership: consolidate CLI/REST alongside MCP, not just the MCP

A domain/service agent's job is to be the **one** place the host reaches that
toolset — not only its MCP server. Most real backends are reachable through
more than one surface (an MCP server, a CLI like `az`/`gh`/`kubectl`, a REST
API, a vendor SDK); when the agent wraps only the MCP tools and leaves the
CLI/REST surface unclaimed, the primary agent (or another plugin) ends up
calling that CLI directly for the exact same backend. That reintroduces the
problem per-agent MCP ownership exists to solve: authenticated access and
noisy round-trips back on the primary context, now through a second,
unguarded path alongside the sub-agent's guarded one.

**Design every domain agent to own the whole toolset, not one transport into
it.** Concretely:

- If the domain has a CLI (or REST surface) that reaches the **same** backend
  the agent's MCP server wraps, document and drive that CLI **from inside the
  agent** — the same write-safety rules (bounded writes, confirmation,
  attribution, read-back) apply to a CLI-driven mutation exactly as they do to
  an MCP-driven one. Don't let the CLI surface stay an implicit, undocumented
  side door.
- A direct caller-level CLI/REST call to that backend is a **fallback for the
  owning agent's own unavailability** (its MCP catalog and materialized/
  one-shot recovery paths all failed) — not a routine parallel path a caller
  reaches for merely because a local credential or CLI happens to also work.
  State this boundary explicitly in the agent's own doc, so callers and
  reviewers have one place to check it.
- When review finds the primary agent (or a different plugin) running that
  domain's CLI directly as a matter of routine, that's a signal to **extend**
  the owning agent to cover it — not to leave two co-equal paths into the same
  backend.

**This is about the raw adapter, not every script that happens to call the
backend.** A skill may freely ship (or reference) its own dedicated,
purpose-built script or tool that itself calls the backend's API/CLI directly
— that is not a violation, even when the agent that normally owns the domain
exists and is healthy. The distinction is **raw vs. dedicated access**:

- **Raw access** means the host (the primary agent, or a skill's own prose
  guidance) is handed the backend's general-purpose adapter itself —
  unrestricted `az <anything>`, hand-rolled REST calls built inline from a
  minted token, or equivalent open-ended MCP tool access — and can compose
  arbitrary requests against it. *This* is what a domain agent must wrap: the
  raw adapter should not be something the primary agent (or a skill's
  narrative instructions) reaches for directly, request by request.
- **A dedicated script or tool** is a fixed, narrow, reviewed, checked-in
  artifact that performs **one well-defined operation** against the backend
  (e.g. a script that authors a specific kind of page, or looks up one
  specific relationship) — not a general-purpose way to call the backend.
  It may legitimately use the backend's raw CLI/REST internally (sometimes
  for a good structural reason, like needing to run in an execution
  environment the owning agent cannot reach), and skills may reference such
  scripts without routing through the owning agent.

When you find a skill reaching for the backend directly, the fix depends on
which shape it is: inline raw-adapter guidance (prose instructions to mint a
token and construct ad hoc calls) should either move behind the owning agent
or be converted into its own small, dedicated script — either resolves it. An
already-dedicated script performing one fixed operation needs no further
change on this axis.

**Worked example (generic).** A domain agent that wraps an issue-tracker MCP
server is the natural place to also drive that same tracker's CLI/REST calls
reaching the identical backend — item creation, label updates, link
verification, token minting for a downstream call. The agent's own doc states
this scope explicitly (e.g. "the preferred path for this tracker's CLI/REST
calls too, not just the MCP's own tools"), and a host-level direct CLI call to
that backend is reserved for the agent being genuinely down, not a shortcut
taken because a locally available credential/CLI happens to also work. A
different skill in the same repo may still ship its own dedicated script that
creates one specific kind of linked artifact directly against the tracker's
REST API — that script is not expected to route through the domain agent.

This is a design posture, not (yet) a `reviewing-customizations` machine
check — audit for it by reading a domain agent's actual scope against what
CLI/REST surfaces exist for its backend, and by grepping the consuming repo
for direct CLI calls to a backend an agent already owns.

## Anti-recursion and tool access

Give agents `tools: ["*"]` (or omit the field) so they have full access to file
I/O, shell, grep, and other tools. Do **not** restrict `tools` as an
anti-recursion mechanism -- it cripples agents that need to read docs, inspect
config, or run commands. Narrow tools only when the agent genuinely must not
have a capability. An agent whose explicit tools list omits `agent` / Task is
Task-disabled and exempt from the self-delegation guard.

**A related, now-obsolete pattern: restricting an MCP-owning agent's `tools`
to *only* its MCP surface** (dropping shell/bash) to force MCP usage and keep
the agent from working around a missing/misbehaving tool. That rationale
predates `agent-mcp`'s `materialize`/`call` subcommands: the materialized CLI
fleet is not a workaround, it is a second, equally-authenticated, equally-scoped
invocation surface over the *same* bridge config -- the bridge's own top-level
`tools:` allow/deny filter enforces identical scope on both surfaces (see
*MCP fallback with agent-mcp* above). Restricting an agent to MCP-only tools
no longer buys any safety; it only disables the required `## MCP Readiness`
fallback below, which needs shell access to invoke the materialized fleet
when the native catalog fails to register. Give an MCP-owning agent full
tool access like any other.

Every Task-capable agent -- including a coordinator that may spawn other agent
types -- must include this literal, agent-specific line:

```markdown
Do NOT use the task tool to spawn another `<agent-name>` agent.
```

This prevents recursive copies without forbidding a deliberately authorized
coordinator from delegating distinct scopes. For MCP-owning agents, keep that
line in the required `## MCP Readiness` section beside the readiness and
fallback behavior:

1. **MCP readiness check.** Every agent with MCP servers must probe one tool on
   startup and preserve the exact observed error if the catalog does not load.
2. **Same-bridge CLI fallback.** After a catalog/load failure, use the existing
   materialized fleet named by the agent. Re-materialize when the expected stub
   is missing or `manifest.json.generated_by` differs from
   `<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> --version`;
   config/schema drift needs a deploy-owned digest. Probe a read-only stub with
   `--no-serve` and verify identity/capability before acting. If both surfaces
   fail, report both errors and stop. This fallback does not bypass an auth
   failure, authorization boundary, confirmation gate, or upstream outage.
3. **Plugin-owned troubleshooting path.** When the agent is packaged in a
   plugin, that plugin must ship a discoverable troubleshooting/diagnostic skill
   for the MCP or bridge failure path. Keep detailed setup, authentication,
   catalog, and recovery procedures there rather than bloating the agent body.
   The plugin `README.md` must also contain an explicit Dependencies,
   Prerequisites, or Requirements section naming required companion plugins,
   runtimes/CLIs, authentication, and any operator setup.
Start from this compact body template, then substitute the real fleet, probe,
and identity:

```markdown
## MCP Readiness

1. Probe `<read-only-tool>`.
2. If the catalog did not load, preserve the exact error and use the existing
   `<fleet>` materialized fleet; materialize the same bridge only if the stub is
   absent or its `generated_by` version differs.
3. Probe the fallback with `--no-serve` and verify `<expected-identity>`.
4. Verify `manifest.json.bridge` resolves to the frontmatter's bridge config.
5. If both surfaces fail, report both errors and stop.
6. If fallback succeeds, include the preserved primary error in the final output.

Do NOT use the task tool to spawn another `<agent-name>` agent.
```

For the full bridge YAML, Windows/POSIX commands, request-file invocation, and
drift policy, load **`agent-mcp:agent-mcp`** and read *Reliable MCP-backed
sub-agent*.

### Hard-rule validation checklist

These are **not** suggestions — they are conformance gates. The
**`reviewing-customizations`** scan machine-checks the presence of readiness,
fallback, and anti-recursion text; reviewers must still verify bridge/identity
equivalence. An agent **fails** review if any applicable box is unchecked:

- [ ] **Every Task-capable agent forbids self-spawn.** Agents with omitted
      `tools`, `tools: ["*"]`, or an explicit `agent` / Task grant include the
      canonical line naming their own agent type. A Task-disabled agent is
      exempt. A coordinator may delegate other types when explicitly authorized
      but may not create another copy of itself.
- [ ] **Tools are not narrowed for anti-recursion.** `tools` is omitted or
      `["*"]` (or lists only *additive* MCP grants); it is **never** trimmed to
      "prevent recursion" — that cripples the agent, it doesn't protect it.
- [ ] **Tools are not narrowed to force MCP-only usage.** An MCP-owning agent's
      `tools` is not restricted to its MCP surface alone to compel MCP calls or
      block workarounds -- `agent-mcp`'s `materialize`/`call` subcommands are an
      equally-authenticated, equally-scoped invocation surface over the same
      bridge, not a workaround, and this restriction only disables the required
      MCP Readiness fallback. **If `tools` is restricted for another, legitimate
      reason (a narrower blast radius, a plugin-specific scope contract), it
      must still include `execute` (or `*`)** -- the materialized-CLI-fallback
      recipe shells out to a `.ps1`/`.cmd` stub and is unusable without
      shell/PowerShell execution, no matter how thoroughly the body documents
      it. `reviewing-customizations` flags this combination as
      `mcp-fallback-needs-shell-tool`.
- [ ] **Every MCP-owning agent has a `## MCP Readiness` section.** If the
      frontmatter declares `mcp-servers`, the body must carry the section that
      houses the readiness, equivalent-fallback, and anti-recursion guards.
- [ ] **Readiness probe present.** The section instructs the agent to probe one
      MCP tool on startup and preserve the specific error (or, absent one, name
      the server/tool that failed), then report it even if fallback succeeds.
- [ ] **Equivalent CLI fallback present, always enabled.** Every agent-mcp-backed
      server names its materialized fleet, uses the same bridge config/
      identity/top-level `tools:` filter, probes a read-only stub with
      `--no-serve`, and stops only after both surfaces fail. Raw product/API
      bypasses are not accepted. **A blanket "disabled by the authorization/
      conditional gate" opt-out is never acceptable, regardless of how
      privileged, credential-minting, or destructive-capable the wrapped MCP
      is** -- see *Decorator boundary reviewed* below for why. Without this
      fallback the agent has **zero recourse, not even by the operator**, when
      Copilot's native MCP catalog fails to register in-session (a Copilot
      CLI-side extension/session-registration gap with no in-session repair):
      every request simply fails outright. `reviewing-customizations` flags the
      obsolete marker as `mcp-fallback-disabled`.
- [ ] **Plugin recovery is discoverable.** A plugin-packaged MCP agent has a
      troubleshooting/diagnostic skill that covers its MCP or bridge failure
      modes, and the plugin README explicitly documents dependencies and
      prerequisites.
- [ ] **No frontmatter-only identity.** Auth/identity-affecting env lives in the
      bridge config or overlay, not only in `mcp-servers.env`.
- [ ] **Fleet provenance matches.** `manifest.json.bridge` resolves to the same
      config path used by the primary frontmatter before the fleet is trusted.
- [ ] **Decorator boundary reviewed, never used to justify disabling the
      fallback.** Duplicate static restrictions in top-level `tools:` are
      redundant with the bridge's own decorators. A bridge's `decorators:`
      (`filter`/`transform`/`gate`) run inside **agent-mcp's own bridge
      runtime**, not the invocation transport -- they are enforced identically
      no matter which surface calls them: the native attached catalog, the
      one-shot `call` subcommand, or a materialized stub. A conditional/
      argument-dependent `gate` therefore does **not** justify disabling the
      fallback (the now-obsolete `Materialized CLI fallback: disabled
      (conditional authorization gate)` marker); it is exactly the case the
      fallback must keep working for. Review only that shape-only decorators
      (a static `filter`/`transform` with no runtime branching) yield a wider
      raw catalog than intended, which the agent should document.
- [ ] **MCP anti-self-delegation line present.** The section contains an explicit
      "Do NOT … (task tool / spawn / delegate) …" directive — canonically the
      literal line "Do NOT use the task tool to spawn another `<agent-name>`
      agent" (with the agent's own name substituted). The scan requires that
      *construction*, not the exact sentence; a paraphrase that drops the "do
      not" opener or those anchor words (e.g. "never call `task`", "no sub-agent
      fallback") reads as **missing**, so keep the canonical wording.
- [ ] **No MCP agent silently omits the guard.** An agent with `mcp-servers` but
      no readiness/anti-recursion text is a **blocking** finding, not a nit — a
      single missing guard is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent.

An agent with **no** `mcp-servers` is exempt from the MCP-readiness rows but
still owes the Task-capability and anti-self-delegation rules above.

### Invoking MCP tools from the shell (sanctioned CLI path)

When the MCP server is an **`agent-mcp` bridge** (`command: agent-mcp`, as most
wrapped upstreams in this ecosystem are) **and the agent has shell access**
(`execute` — which `tools: ["*"]` grants), the same catalog is invocable straight
from the CLI, no JSON-RPC by hand. `<bridge>` is the bridge's **registered name or
the exact config path** the frontmatter uses — e.g. the `--config <path>` the
`mcp-servers` block passes, given positionally:

- **`<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> call <bridge> <tool> '<arguments-json>'`** — one-shot: invoke a
  single upstream tool and print the result (pipeable; also reads the args JSON on
  stdin).
- **`<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> materialize <bridge>`** — project the whole `tools/list` catalog
  into a discoverable CLI stub fleet under `~/.agent-mcp/materialized/<server>/` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow doc-example -->
  (each stub forwards through the legacy global `agent-mcp call` management <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow materialized-stub-management -->
  wrapper, so tools are invocable by name and pipe
  like any command; `--windows` emits a `.ps1`/`.cmd` shim farm). Re-running
  rebuilds atomically, so it doubles as a drift refresh.

This is a **first-class, sanctioned path** and the required load-failure
fallback for authorization-equivalent agent-mcp-backed agents: it loads the
same bridge configuration and follows the same upstream auth, protocol, and
top-level `tools:` filtering path. It is the bridge's own CLI face, not an
improvised bypass. Shell fallback does not inherit `mcp-servers.env`; move such
values into the bridge config/overlay rather than exporting them ad hoc.

Decorator stacks are intentionally not applied by `call`/`materialize`. The
fleet exposes raw upstream names/results after the top-level `tools:` filter, so
an agent whose safety depends on decorator-only `filter`/`gate` cannot use this
fallback. See **`agent-mcp:agent-mcp`** →
*Reliable agent-mcp transport and fallback*.

Three boundaries keep this coherent with the readiness rule above:

- **Report the primary failure before falling back.** A probe that fails while
  the same bridge answers on the CLI is an in-process registration fault worth
  surfacing; record it, then continue through the equivalent fleet rather than
  hiding the discrepancy.
- **It cannot rescue a broken bridge.** If the *bridge itself* is broken (upstream
  down, credentials missing, provisioning failed), the generated global
  management call fails
  **identically** — same bridge — so it can't paper over a genuine bridge fault.
  Report the specific error and stop; don't loop.
- **Same bridge, not a raw bypass.** The forbidden fallback (previous section) is
  reaching the upstream by a *different* transport to route around the bridge.
  `call`/`materialize` go *through* the bridge, so they stay inside the policy.

## Wrapping an MCP server: make the agent reachable

The guards above stop a wrapped-MCP agent from *misbehaving*, but a subtler
failure is a request never reaching it. When you wrap an MCP server in a
sub-agent, that agent becomes the **only** path to its tools — so it must be
**unambiguously routable**, or a superficially similar request is silently
captured by a *neighboring capability that operates a different backend*.

The canonical trap: a live-state MCP agent (e.g. one that manages the operator's
**live, signed-in** browser tabs) sits next to an **automation** capability
(e.g. Playwright driving a **separate, dedicated** browser profile). A request
like "organize my browser tabs" reads as browser work, routes to the automation
skill, and drives the *wrong* browser — or dead-ends when automation can't reach
live state. The two operate different backends for a request that sounds like one
capability.

When wrapping an MCP server, therefore:

- **Give the agent a crisp, distinctive description with concrete trigger
  phrases** for the exact live requests it should own ("organize my Edge tabs",
  "find an open tab"), and state its **backend/scope** explicitly (live
  signed-in session vs. a dedicated automation profile) so the router can tell it
  apart from neighbors.
- **Pair it with a routing skill when a neighbor competes.** A short skill whose
  body just delegates to the agent (and names the boundary vs. the neighboring
  capability) is the reliable way to pin routing — an agent description alone can
  lose to a well-triggered sibling skill.
- **Check for capability collisions.** Run the **`reviewing-customizations`**
  scan over the *loaded* set (`--from-settings`); it surfaces **skill↔skill**
  trigger overlaps, including LOCAL↔PLUGIN. Know its limit: it does **not** put
  *agent* descriptions in the collision map, so an **agent-vs-skill** competition
  (exactly the live-tabs-vs-automation trap) will not show up mechanically. That
  is a further reason to give the MCP agent a **routing skill** — a skill *is*
  scanned, so its triggers join the collision map — and to eyeball neighboring
  skills by hand. Two surfaces that both plausibly answer the same phrase but hit
  different backends is a routing bug, even when neither is "wrong" in isolation.
- **State the boundary in both places.** In the MCP agent *and* its neighbor,
  add a one-line "do not use X for this; that's Y's job" so a mis-route
  self-corrects instead of quietly driving the wrong backend.
