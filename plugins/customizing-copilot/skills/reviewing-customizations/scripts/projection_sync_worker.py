"""projection-sync-worker: the one-shot deterministic sync tool.

Phase 2 of ``efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability``: the "given a
consumer repo, do everything a scheduled/non-agentic run needs to decide in
one pass" tool the Plan calls for. ``instruction_projections.py`` provides
the mechanism (render/write/lock via ``sync_repository``, validate/compare
via ``scan_repository``) and ``projection_reflect.py`` provides the policy
(classification, the actionable-change trigger, the trusted-source and
immutable-pin conjuncts). This module is the missing piece that composes
both into a **single deterministic pass with a single outcome**, so a caller
never needs more than one invocation -- and therefore never more than one
PR -- to fully resolve one round of upstream change:

* :func:`run_sync_pass` runs ``sync`` (the only mutation: it writes/locks
  whatever it can safely resolve) then ``scan`` (validates the result and
  reports everything it cannot resolve) exactly once, and returns a single
  :class:`SyncOutcome` that already carries the complete decision --
  whether there is nothing to report, a bypass-eligible diff, or a diff that
  needs conflict-dispatch. A caller branches on that outcome's properties;
  it never has to re-run this tool to "finish" a run that already ran.
  Both ``sync``'s and ``scan``'s own findings feed that one decision --
  a sync-side failure (a rejected ownership conflict, a failed lock
  acquisition, a budget overrun) must never look like a clean, do-nothing
  run just because a subsequent scan has nothing new of its own to report.
  Likewise, a **lock-only update** (e.g. a plugin version bump that renders
  identical content, so no destination appears in ``sync``'s own `changed`
  list) still moves that source's locked identity -- this module diffs the
  lock's entries before and after the pass so the trusted-source and
  immutable-pin conjuncts are evaluated against it too, never silently
  skipped because no file byte happened to change.
* This module still performs **no git or PR/dispatch operations** of its
  own (consistent with ``projection_reflect.py``'s own boundary) -- those
  are the calling scheduler's job (Phase 5, per-adopting-repo, out of this
  repo's own scope). What this module guarantees is that the *decision*
  those git-side actions act on is always complete and final after one call,
  never requiring a second round of this tool's own logic to discover more
  work the first call missed.
* Refreshing installed plugin payloads (fetching whatever a marketplace's
  enabled plugins currently publish) is host/environment-specific and is
  therefore the caller's responsibility too, via the optional ``refresh``
  callback run before the sync/scan pass -- never implicit, and never
  retried mid-pass (a flaky refresh should fail the whole pass rather than
  silently sync against a half-refreshed source set).
* :func:`run_sync_pass` is a general-purpose library function: it takes an
  explicit ``trusted_marketplaces`` value from any caller (a test, or a
  scheduler that has already resolved consent) and performs no consent
  check itself. The CLI entry point (``main()``/``__main__``) is different:
  it is the actual consent-gated scheduled-worker surface, so it calls
  ``projection_reflect_consent.load_consent()`` first and refuses to run at
  all -- no mutation, no trust decision -- when this repo has no live,
  committed opt-in; when consent is present, the CLI derives
  ``trusted_marketplaces`` from that consent object, never from a
  caller-suppliable command-line flag.

    ``sync_repository_locked`` is the only mutation this function performs
    (it writes/locks whatever it can safely resolve); ``scan_repository``
    then validates the result and reports everything sync could not
    resolve. Both run exactly once per call, **inside the same held
    per-repository lock** as the before/after lock-entry reads -- so a
    concurrent worker's own sync can never interleave between this pass's
    sync and its scan/lock-read and get misattributed to this call's
    outcome. This function is otherwise a pure composition of
    ``instruction_projections`` and ``projection_reflect``, so re-running it
    on an unchanged repo is idempotent and produces the same (empty)
    outcome, never an accumulating side effect.

    ``resolve_pins`` (preferred over a precomputed ``pinned_commits``) is
    called with the same ``sources`` list *after* ``refresh`` and *inside*
    the held lock, immediately before the locked sync -- resolving pins any
    earlier (e.g. before ``refresh``, or entirely outside this function)
    leaves a window where a refresh or a concurrent update changes a
    directory-marketplace payload after its commit was captured, so the
    stale-but-well-formed SHA in a precomputed map would still pass
    ``bypass_decision``'s pin conjunct even though it no longer describes
    what this pass actually renders. When both ``resolve_pins`` and
    ``pinned_commits`` are given, ``resolve_pins`` wins for this call (a
    caller doing fresh resolution should not also pass a possibly-stale
    map); ``pinned_commits`` alone remains for callers (tests, or a
    resolver-free scheduler) that accept a caller-supplied map without this
    revalidation. A ``resolve_pins`` call that returns ``None`` is
    normalized to an empty map, never treated as "no ``pinned_commits`` was
    ever supplied": a resolver failure must still leave the pin conjunct
    active (fail-closed, review-only for every changed source), not
    silently disable pin enforcement for a caller that explicitly opted
