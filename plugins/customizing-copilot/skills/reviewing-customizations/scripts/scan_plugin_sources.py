class PluginSource:
    """A loaded plugin with ownership, source, and release identity.

    ``controlled`` is True when the repo under review OWNS the plugin (its own
    in-repo ``.ai`` directory-marketplace plugins, or its ``plugins/*`` suite):
    those get full checks and their findings are actionable in-repo. When False
    the plugin is **external** (installed from another marketplace) -- its skills
    are reference-only for collision detection, while agent safety findings are
    advisory and carry an upstream remediation pointer.

    ``commit`` is a best-effort immutable git commit SHA captured at
    *discovery* time -- when (and only when) the payload lives inside a
    trusted git working tree (this repo's own tree, or a checkout resolved
    via the ``agent-worktrees-repo`` source kind), empty otherwise (e.g. a
    plain installed-plugins payload copy with no local git history, or an
    arbitrary ``directory`` source with no verifiable provenance). It can
    go stale between discovery and use (e.g. across a `refresh` that
    advances the checkout) -- :func:`resolve_pinned_commits` re-probes
    fresh rather than trusting this field for exactly that reason.
    ``is_local_checkout`` marks which sources are even eligible for that
    re-probe: only ``controlled`` (this reviewing repo's own tree) or a
    footprint resolved via ``agent-worktrees-repo`` (a registered, named
    repo looked up through the trusted ``agent-worktrees`` CLI) qualify --
    a plain ``directory`` source is an arbitrary local path declared in a
    marketplace manifest with no provenance guarantee at all (it could
    point at a payload copied into a subdirectory of some entirely
    unrelated git repository), and an installed-plugins footprint is
    always a copied external payload; neither is ever re-probed or pinned.

    the caller's intent.

    **HEAD is read before *and* after the cleanliness check**, and both
    reads must agree: the clean check and a single ``rev-parse`` are two
    separate subprocesses with no shared lock, so a payload modified in the

    and requiring it to be unchanged catches any concurrent commit/checkout
    that moved it during the probe -- it does not eliminate every possible
    race against a payload change (no purely read-only, unlocked probe
    can), but it closes the specific, easily-observable window between this
