"""projection-reflect: deterministic-sync decision layer.

Phase 2 of ``efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability``: a generic
sync-automation recipe modeled on the facility's own proven ``config-reflect``
system (reflect/reconcile split, fail-closed producer, narrow bypass, domain-
deduped conflict dispatch, non-self-merging reconciler).

``instruction_projections.py``'s ``sync_repository()``/``scan_repository()``
already perform the mechanical work (render, write, lock, and detect every
drift/conflict class as a ``Finding``). This module adds the POLICY a
scheduled, non-agentic sync worker needs on top of that mechanism, so it can
decide whether a run is safe to fold into a stamp-labeled, bypass-eligible PR
or must instead route to conflict-dispatch:

* deterministic finding **classification** (fail-closed allowlist: only
  ``projection-missing`` and ``projection-source-update`` are plain drift
  that ``sync`` already resolved -- every other check name, including one
  this module has never seen before, requires conflict-dispatch);
* the **"did anything change" trigger** (``changed or lock_updated``, not
  ``changed`` alone -- a lock-only update, or a `scan` finding with no file
  change, must never be silently treated as a no-op);
* a **trusted-source allowlist** gate, keyed off the lock's own
  ``plugin@marketplace`` identity (never installed-payload trust alone --
  ``discover_enabled_sources`` resolves every repository-enabled
  marketplace, including third-party ones this repo did not author).

This module never renders, writes, or pushes anything itself -- it is a pure
decision layer over an already-produced ``Result`` (or two: `sync`'s and
`scan`'s). It intentionally does not depend on ``instruction_projections``'s
internals: callers pass plain findings/entries, so this stays trivially
testable and reusable if the lock/finding shape is ever renamed.

**Immutable-pin verification: partially closed, gap narrowed.** The existing
lock schema (``instruction_projections.py``'s ``_LOCK_ENTRY_KEYS``) records a
plugin *version* string, not the immutable upstream commit/release a
projection was rendered from, so a byte-exact recompute against it only
proves internal self-consistency (the checked-in file matches its own lock
entry -- which ``scan_repository`` already enforces as
``projection-local-modification``, correctly conflict-routed by this
module's allowlist), not that the *source* a reviewer re-fetches later is the
exact one the PR was rendered from.

Closing this fully needs a marketplace-source resolver that can return a
commit SHA for an installed payload -- no such resolver exists today
(``scan_plugin_sources.py``'s ``PluginSource``/``_plugin_version`` only carry
a mutable version string), and inventing one blind was deliberately left
undone rather than guessed. **Widening the lock schema itself was
deliberately rejected for this slice**: ``_LOCK_ENTRY_KEYS`` is an
exact-match key set enforced on every already-rendered projection's
provenance marker repo-wide, so adding a required key there would force a
disruptive full resync of every managed instruction file in one PR just to
carry a field nothing can populate yet -- exactly the kind of ad hoc,
under-designed move the effort's Journal warns against.

Instead this module accepts an **additive, optional pin map**
(``pinned_commits``: ``"<plugin>@<marketplace>" -> commit SHA``) kept
entirely outside the lock/marker schema. When a caller has no resolver yet,
it simply omits the argument (``None``, the default) and behavior is
unchanged from before this existed. Once *any* resolver -- of any shape --
can populate such a map for some or all sources, a caller passes it and
:func:`bypass_decision` will require a pin for every changed source before
allowing bypass, closing the remaining half of this gap without a schema
migration. Building that resolver remains a follow-up slice of
``efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability`` (see its Journal).
