# Reviewing Customizations

A repeatable review pass over the things that make a harness *behave* — its
skills, sub-agents, instruction files, hooks, and MCP configs. Run it whenever
you author or change these, and as the review step (Phase 8) of the
**`building-harnesses`** runbook. Unlike a one-off code review, this is scoped to
Copilot CLI customization surfaces and checks them against the authoring skills
this plugin ships.

## What to review

Gather the harness's customization surfaces:

- **Skills** — every `SKILL.md` under `.github/skills/` (and any plugin skills
  the harness authors).
- **Sub-agents** — every `.agent.md` under `.github/agents/` and
  `.claude/agents/`, explicitly declared repository-owned agent roots, plus
  agents shipped by the plugins enabled for this repo.
- **Instructions** — root `AGENTS.md` and any nested `AGENTS.md` / custom
  instruction files.
- **Hooks** — `.github/hooks/*.json` (or `hooks.json`).
- **MCP configs** — per-agent `mcp-servers`, project `.mcp.json` /
  `.github/mcp.json`, user `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` if it is relevant to
  the loaded session, plugin `mcpServers`, and any `agent-mcp` bridge configs.

## Method: mechanical scan, then design critique

Run the fast **mechanical scan** first to clear the machine-checkable violations,
then the **design critique** for the judgment calls the scan can't make, and a
**conformance cross-check** against the authoring skills.

### 0. Mechanical scan (repeatable)

Before any hand review, run the bundled scanner over the repo root — it catches
the checkable violations consistently so the human/sub-agent pass can focus on
design:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> [--json] [--strict]
```

Repositories that own agent definitions outside the standard directories name
each directory explicitly:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --owned-agent-root services/example/agents
```

`--owned-agent-root` is repeatable, repository-relative, non-recursive, and
limited to immediate `*.agent.md` children. Those agents receive the same
blocking ownership checks as `.github/agents`; absolute paths, traversal,
missing directories, and symlink escapes are rejected. The same roots join
`--context-budget` metadata accounting.

It reports (BLOCKING vs WARNING) on: **skill frontmatter** (`name` +
`description`), **name/folder match**, **trigger collisions** across skills,
**anti-recursion** (a Task-capable agent without an agent-specific
anti-self-delegation line), **agent manifest declaration** (a plugin shipping
`agents/*.agent.md` whose manifest does not declare a truthy top-level
`agents` field -- explicit is more robust than the runtime's implicit
`plugin_root/agents` default), **MCP readiness** (an MCP-owning agent without a
`## MCP Readiness` section), **agent-mcp fallback** (an agent-mcp-backed agent
without an equivalent materialized CLI fallback), **MCP plugin recovery** (a
plugin-packaged MCP agent without a discoverable troubleshooting skill, or
without an explicit dependency/prerequisite section in the plugin README),
**inline secrets** in config files, **raw IPs** in ssh/scp/rsync commands, and,
with `--from-settings`,
**session-start context composition**, including ambiguous stacks with more than
one possible non-empty output.
`--strict` exits non-zero on any BLOCKING finding, so it drops into a hook or CI
gate. It is a **heuristic aid, not a proof** — it deliberately under-flags rather
than cry wolf; feed its findings into the design critique, don't treat a clean
scan as a full review.

The ordinary scan also validates checked-in static instruction projections and
`.github/copilot/context-projections.json` offline. With `--from-settings`, it
uses the same enabled-plugin payload resolution as the rest of the scan to
compare each explicit `instruction-projections.json` declaration with the
checked-in result. Findings cover missing or stale projections, malformed
declarations/markers/locks, duplicate ids or destinations, conflicting
ownership, safely detectable `applyTo` overlap, orphaned lock/file entries,
legacy marked `AGENTS.md` regions, 4 KiB per-file and 12 KiB aggregate budgets,
and dynamic/session-specific content that cannot be checked in safely.

### Static fail-safe projection sync

Until the supported Copilot CLI version floor proves native composition of every
plugin-owned `sessionStart` `additionalContext` value, checked-in projections
plus exact-session guidance files are the reliable ambient-policy path. A plugin
declares a bounded, data-only pointer or fallback template and, when guidance is
dynamic, uses an output-free `sessionStart` hook to write the exact session's
file. Synchronize enabled declarations with the companion manager:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py sync <repo-root>
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py scan <repo-root>
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py \
  scan <repo-root> --from-settings --json
```

`sync` reads committed repository settings independently of interactive folder
trust, then reads only the explicit declaration and canonical template from
each enabled payload (personal activation does not change a shared checked-in
projection). Malformed settings and unavailable enabled payloads block the
operation. It creates or updates only the declared
`.github/instructions/<plugin>/` destination, writes deterministic UTF-8/LF
bytes with machine-readable provenance, and commits all changed projections and
the deterministic lock as one serialized, compare-before-replace,
rollback-protected transaction. It refuses
unmarked files, malformed or missing ownership, different owners, local body
edits, nonportable or case-conflicting destinations, path escape, and
symlink/reparse indirection. It never deletes repository-owned files; orphaned
projections and old managed regions are review findings for a human or ordinary
repository change to remove.

### `projection-reflect`: automating the sync (deterministic worker policy)

`sync`/`scan` above are the mechanism; a scheduled, non-agentic worker that
runs them unattended for a consumer repo needs an additional **policy** layer
before it may fold a run's diff into an auto-mergeable PR --
`scripts/projection_reflect.py` provides exactly that layer (pure functions,
no rendering/writing/pushing of its own):

- **The "did anything happen" trigger is `changed or lock_updated`, never
  `changed` alone** (`has_actionable_change`) -- `sync` can report an empty
  `changed` list with a lock-only update, and a no-op sync can still pair
  with a `scan` that finds something.
- **Deterministic, fail-closed finding classification** (`classify_findings`):
  only `projection-missing` and `projection-source-update` are plain drift
  `sync` already resolved. Every other check name -- including one not yet
  invented -- is conflict-routed by default; a newly added
  `instruction_projections.py` check must be reviewed and explicitly
  allowlisted here before a worker may silently fold it into a bypass.
- **Trusted-source allowlist** (`marketplace_of` + `bypass_decision`), keyed
  off a lock entry's own `plugin@marketplace` identity -- `sync`'s
  `discover_enabled_sources` resolves every repository-enabled marketplace,
  including third-party ones this repo did not author, so byte-exact
  reproducibility alone is never sufficient to bypass review.

A worker composes these with `sync_repository`/`scan_repository`'s own
`Result.findings` and the lock's changed entries to get a single
`BypassDecision`; `eligible=False` names every violated conjunct (not just
the first). See `projection_reflect.py`'s own module docstring for the
immutable upstream-commit pinning conjunct (`pinned_commits`, additive and
optional). `scan_plugin_sources.resolve_pinned_commits()` is a real,
honestly-partial resolver for it: it re-probes each `is_local_checkout`
source's commit **fresh at call time** (never trusting the informational-
only `PluginSource.commit` field captured at discovery, which can precede
a `refresh` that advances the checkout) via `git rev-parse HEAD` inside
that source's own payload root -- a plain installed-plugins payload copy
(the common case for an externally-installed marketplace plugin, and
never marked `is_local_checkout`) has no local git history to read, and is
simply absent from the resulting map rather than guessed at (see its own
docstring, and issue #3132 for that remaining half). See
`efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability`'s Journal for status on
the
externally-installed-source resolver described just above -- the only
remaining piece; the scheduler wrapper (`projection_sync_worker.py`) and
the setup skill (`setting-up-instruction-sync-worker`) are both already
implemented. A conflict a worker cannot bypass routes to
`agent_dispatch.conflict_dispatch`'s generalized dispatch primitive, naming
the
[`projection-reconciler` agent template](references/projection-reconciler-agent-template.md)
-- report-only on a hand-edited managed projection, re-derive-fresh on an
ordinary git-level conflict, never a self-merge.

### `projection_sync_worker.py`: the one-shot deterministic sync tool

Composing `sync`, `scan`, and `projection_reflect`'s policy by hand every
run risks exactly the failure mode this effort exists to close: a worker
that discovers more work on a second pass and needs a follow-up PR to
finish resolving a single upstream change. `scripts/projection_sync_worker.py`
wraps that whole recipe into **one function, one call, one outcome** per
run:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/projection_sync_worker.py <repo-root> --json
```

`run_sync_pass()` acquires `instruction_projections`'s per-repository sync
lock once (`repository_sync_lock()`), then runs `sync_repository_locked()`
(the only mutation -- it writes/locks whatever it can safely resolve,
assuming the caller already holds the lock) then `scan_repository()`
(which validates the result and reports everything it could not resolve)
exactly once, keeping the same lock held across both calls and the
before/after lock-entry reads -- so a concurrent worker's own sync can
never interleave and get misattributed to this pass's outcome (plain
`sync_repository()`/`scan_repository()` remain available for a caller that
only needs one operation standalone, without this atomicity guarantee).
It returns a `SyncOutcome` whose `needs_pr` / `bypass_eligible` /
`needs_conflict_dispatch` properties are already the complete decision --
a caller branches on that outcome directly; it never needs to re-invoke this
tool to discover more work from the same run, so a scheduler wired to it
opens at most one PR per invocation. `needs_conflict_dispatch` is true only
for a real conflict-classified finding (a hand-edit, a failed sync); an
untrusted-marketplace source or a missing/malformed immutable pin refuses
the bypass but opens a normal review-only PR instead, since there is
nothing there for a reconciler to act on. It performs no git or PR/dispatch
operations of its own (that remains the calling scheduler's job, per-adopting-
repo and out of this repo's own scope -- see Phase 5); refreshing installed
plugin payloads is similarly the caller's job, via an optional `refresh`
callback run once before the pass (never retried mid-pass).

### Worktree-scoped local cache -- the consent-free, permissionless read path

`sync`/`scan`/`run_sync_pass()` above mutate the checked-in projection and
its lock -- privileged, PR-gated, consent-gated by design (see Phase 5).
`instruction_projections.render_local_cache(repo_root, discover_sources)` is
a deliberately **un**privileged sibling: it renders each enabled source's
*current* projection into a gitignored `<sourceId>.local.instructions.md`
file next to its checked-in destination
(`local_sibling_destination()` computes the path) -- no consent check, no
mutation of any checked-in file, lock, or git history. It *does* hold its
own dedicated lock (`_local_cache_lock`, separate from `sync`'s own) so
concurrent callers for the same repository can't interleave their
render/write/cleanup passes -- distinct from the checked-in sync's lock in
purpose and lifetime. A caller must handle contention: a locked-out call
returns a blocking `projection-local-cache-lock` finding and refreshes
nothing at all, rather than assuming every call updates the cache: retry
later, or treat it as a benign no-op if this call was only ever a
best-effort refresh. `discover_sources` is a callable, resolved only after
the lock is acquired -- never a precomputed list -- so no call can act on a
source set a more recent call has already superseded. See
`docs/patterns/worktree-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`: any session, regardless
of push rights or scheduled-worker opt-in, can always see a fresh render of
what's currently installed without a privileged sync. Call it
unconditionally -- worktree create/resume, `sessionStart`, or any read path --
since a failure on one source never blocks another and nothing it does
mutates a checked-in file or git history.

The CLI (`main()`/`__main__`) is the actual consent-gated scheduled-worker
surface: it calls `projection_reflect_consent.load_consent()` first and
refuses to run at all -- no mutation, no trust decision made -- without this
repo's own live, committed opt-in, deriving its trusted-source allowlist
from that consent object rather than any command-line flag. There is
deliberately no `--installed-root`-style override on this CLI: letting the
bypass-eligible path source projections from a caller-chosen payload root,
rather than the repo's own settings-resolved, consent-trusted sources,
would let a substituted, unverified payload tree ride the same auto-merge
surface a real trusted source gets. `run_sync_pass()` itself stays a
general-purpose library function that takes `trusted_marketplaces`
explicitly from any caller (including a test or an already-consent-resolved
scheduler); the consent gate lives at the CLI boundary, not inside the pure
composition.

The committed consent file's `requireImmutablePin` (default `false` when
absent) gates whether the CLI enforces the pin conjunct at all: most
adopters sync externally-installed marketplace plugins, which
`resolve_pinned_commits()` cannot pin -- enforcing it unconditionally would
silently disable the bypass path entirely for that common case. A repo
opts in explicitly only once it understands today's tradeoff (only
self-hosted/directory-marketplace sources can ever be pinned). When
enabled, the CLI passes `resolve_pinned_commits` to `run_sync_pass()` as
`resolve_pins` (a callback), never a precomputed map: `run_sync_pass` calls
it after `refresh` and inside its own held lock, immediately before the
locked sync -- resolving pins any earlier would leave a window where a
refresh or a concurrent update changes a payload after its commit was
captured, letting a stale-but-well-formed SHA pass the pin conjunct even
though it no longer describes what that pass actually renders.
`resolve_pinned_commits()` itself pins only a clean checkout:
`_plugin_commit()` rejects any modified, untracked, or ignored file inside
the payload (forcing full untracked enumeration regardless of a
`status.showUntrackedFiles` config), re-reads `HEAD` before and after that
check and requires them to agree, and runs every git subprocess with
`GIT_*` environment variables stripped so an inherited `GIT_DIR`/
`GIT_WORK_TREE` override can never redirect the probe at an unrelated
repository.

### Troubleshooting-category coverage registry

A plugin may additionally ship a `troubleshooting-index.json` at its payload
root, declaring the "what do I do when X happens" failure-mode categories it
claims to own an ambient answer for (e.g. `agent-worktrees` claiming
`claims-ledger`, `resource-obligations`):

```json
{
  "schema": "copilot-extensions.troubleshooting-index",
  "version": 1,
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "claims-ledger",
      "summary": "Inspect or release an outbound claim on another worktree.",
      "pointer": "`claims` command / `tracing-claimant-graphs` skill",
      "markers": ["claims-ledger", "tracing-claimant-graphs"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This registry is opt-in, independent of `instruction-projections.json`, and
targets exactly the gap the
`efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability` audit found: skills are
pull-only, so a category with no ambient pointer is undiscoverable to an
agent that doesn't already know the skill exists. The suite's guard test
(`plugins/customizing-copilot/tests/test_troubleshooting_index.py`, backed by
`scripts/troubleshooting_index.py`) fails closed the moment a plugin declares
a category with no matching `markers` string present in any of that plugin's
own static instruction-projection templates -- a category claimed but not
actually indexed anywhere ambient. See
[`docs/patterns/agents-md-vs-instructions-split.md`](../../../../docs/patterns/agents-md-vs-instructions-split.md)'s
fourth audit question for when a category belongs in this registry.

### Session guidance conformance

For a complete migration rather than a point-in-time scan, follow
[`references/session-guidance-conformance.md`](references/session-guidance-conformance.md).
It has two modes:

- **adopting repository** -- update payloads, disable the retired authority at
  repository precedence, remove its config, synchronize every enabled
  projection, scan the settings-derived roster, and run blind launch probes;
- **plugin suite** -- classify every marketplace plugin, migrate dynamic
  guidance to exact-session writers, preserve static-only/output-free hooks,
  remove retired machinery, and enforce the complete roster mechanically.

The runbook also owns the later native-host transition gate. It never treats a
custom cross-plugin aggregator as a migration option.

The manager exits nonzero for every blocking conflict. Its `--json` result is a
stable versioned object for automation. A plugin remains independently usable
without this manager: its hook and skills do not import a sibling plugin. The
manager is the suite's reference consumer of the optional inert projection
contract.

Add `--context-budget` for a reproducible, counts-only inventory:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --from-settings --context-budget \
  --owned-agent-root services/example/agents
```

It counts Unicode characters, UTF-8 bytes, words, and estimated tokens using the
fixed heuristic `ceil(Unicode characters / 4)`. It separates always-loaded repo
instructions, nested/conditional `AGENTS.md`, standard personal Copilot
instructions, `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` payloads, enabled skill/agent
frontmatter metadata upper bounds, `additionalContext`-capable command-hook
registrations, prompt-hook registrations, and other hook registrations. Dynamic
payload size remains unknown by default; prompt-hook payloads are reported
separately and are not counted as `additionalContext`.
JSON output includes a stable `context_budget` object.

Add `--capture-dynamic` to also measure the real session-scoped
`instructions/**/*.instructions.md` files each plugin's `sessionStart` command
hook writes (see `docs/patterns/session-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`), turning
the "unknown" additionalContext row into real byte/token counts:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --from-settings --context-budget --capture-dynamic
```

This runs only **plugin-owned** `sessionStart` command hooks (never
repository- or user-level hook files), once each, with a synthetic session
payload and a disposable sandbox `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` -- every facility
session-guidance writer resolves its session-state root via `Path.home()`,
so the override fully redirects the write; the real
`~/.copilot/session-state` tree is never touched, and the sandbox is removed
afterward. A hook that fails or times out is named in a per-plugin `errors`
list rather than silently reported as zero. Because it executes already-
installed, already-trusted plugin code (the same hooks a normal session runs
on every launch), this is a materially different -- and lower-risk --
operation than running arbitrary untrusted marketplace hooks; it is still
opt-in given it executes code at all.

The report prints paths and counts only. It never dumps instruction contents or
hook commands, and it **never executes hooks merely to measure them unless
`--capture-dynamic` is given**. The token
estimate is a comparison heuristic, not a tokenizer result; metadata is an upper
bound, and dynamic context remains unknown until runtime. The budget excludes
runtime MCP tool schemas unless an authoritative runtime measurement is
available. MCP configuration bytes are not rendered tool-schema cost and must
not be reported as though they were.

**Scan the plugin set actually LOADED for the repo — `--from-settings`.** Trigger
collisions are computed from both the structured `Trigger phrases include:` list
**and** inline prose (`Use when asked to "…"`) — a skill hides no triggers by
choosing prose. But the bigger blind spot is *which skills are even in scope*: a
harness that *consumes* plugins can mis-route when a **local** skill collides
with a **plugin** skill, and (for a repo that packages its own skills as in-repo
`.ai` plugins) the repo's *own* owned skills live outside `.github/skills`.
`--from-settings` resolves the repo's `.github/copilot/settings.json` (+ user
settings) `enabledPlugins` / `extraKnownMarketplaces` into the concrete loaded
set and brings each into scope:

```bash
# review against exactly what this repo loads (in-repo .ai plugins fully
# checked; external marketplace plugin agents advisory + source-classified):
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> --from-settings
```

> **`agent-worktrees-repo` marketplace sources.** If any `extraKnownMarketplaces`
> entry declares `{"source": "agent-worktrees-repo", "repo": "<name>"}`, add
> `--agent-worktrees-path "<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>"` to either
> `scan-customizations.py --from-settings` or `manage-instruction-projections.py
> sync` (no flag needed) / `manage-instruction-projections.py scan
> --from-settings` -- all share the same resolver, and ambient `PATH` could
> otherwise select a different marketplace/cell's install.

- An **in-repo `directory` marketplace** plugin (e.g. `./.ai`) is *owned* — it
  gets the full frontmatter / name-folder / trigger checks, closing the gap
  where a repo's own `.ai` skills were invisible to the scan.
- An **external marketplace** plugin is *advisory*: its skills join the
  collision map (so a `LOCAL ↔ PLUGIN` clash is visible), and its Task-capable
  agents receive anti-self-delegation / MCP-readiness / agent-mcp-fallback
  checks. Plugins that package MCP-owning agents are also checked for one
  discoverable MCP troubleshooting skill and a README dependency/prerequisite
  section. Findings are warnings tagged with plugin origin, installed version,
  source, and the upstream contribution path because the consumer cannot edit
  the installed payload.
- When an editable `plugins/*` suite skill or agent matches an installed copy
  by plugin and item name, the editable source wins. The scanner does not
  report stale installed copies as external collisions or agent advisories.
- A Task-disabled agent whose explicit `tools` list omits `agent` / Task is
  exempt from the anti-self-delegation check. A coordinator agent is not exempt:
  it may delegate other types when authorized, but it must still forbid another
  copy of itself.

The same loaded-set pass inventories each active command `sessionStart` plugin
without executing hooks. It reports plugin identities and these roles only:

- **complete declared output-capable** — a complete declaration says the hook
  may emit context;
- **proven output-free** — a complete `context: none` declaration or a
  suite-standard exact-session writer/bootstrap/registration shape proves the
  hook does not emit model context; and
- **legacy direct or unknown** — no complete declaration proves the hook
  output-free.

Stacks containing only side-effect-only exact-session writers, bootstrap hooks,
registrations, and other output-free work are valid without a composition
authority. One possible non-empty output is also valid. More than one possible
non-empty result is BLOCKING unless the runtime version floor has a separately
proven merge contract for that event and field. An unavailable external payload
is a warning by itself, but joins collision detection when another possible
output is present. Reports never include hook commands, contributor argv, or
emitted context.

The version-1 `sessionContext` declaration remains useful as static proof that a
side-effect hook returns only `{}`. Existing output-capable declarations are
treated conservatively as possible non-empty output; they do not establish
execution order or composition. The current contract and the future native-host
composition seam are in `authoring-skills`'
[`references/hook-output-composition.md`](../authoring-skills/references/hook-output-composition.md).

Collision owners are tagged with their origin (`skill [marketplace/plugin]`).
(The older `--include-installed` / `--include-plugins DIR` still work — they add
a raw installed-plugin tree the same advisory way — but `--from-settings`
is preferred because it scopes to the *enabled* set, not every installed
plugin.)

**A finding that touches an external plugin is outside your repo's control.**
The scan says so, names the upstream `source` and version, and points at the fix
path. You can't edit the plugin in-repo, so choose:

1. **In-repo workaround** — reclaim the phrase with a local authority-override
   skill, disable the offending plugin for this repo, or narrow *your* trigger.
2. **Upstream fix** — file an issue / open a PR on the plugin's source repo. If a
   **`<repo>-harness`** plugin is enabled for that source, use its
   **`contributing-to-<repo>`** skill as the concrete fix path (for the
   copilot-extensions suite that's **`copilot-extensions-harness` →
   `contributing-to-copilot-extensions`**). This `<repo>-harness → contributing`
   hop is the **skill bridge**: it turns "this is broken in an external plugin"
   into "here is exactly where and how to fix it."

Some collisions are intentional (an authority override that deliberately
reclaims a phrase); judge each in the design critique rather than "fixing" it
blindly. And **never edit an external plugin's installed payload in place** — it
is overwritten on update; fix it in-repo or upstream.

### 1. Design critique (rubber-duck)

Hand the gathered files to a **reviewer** — the Copilot CLI **`/rubber-duck`**
critique command where available, a harness-provided review sub-agent, or an
equivalent independent reviewer. Ask it for **bugs and design flaws, not style**:

- ambiguous, overlapping, or colliding **trigger phrases** across skills;
- **duplicate or redundant** skills that should merge (context-budget waste);
- **ambient-guidance skills that restate standing rules one-shot** instead of
  respecting the authoritative owner — a skill whose body *is* a
  persona/style/safety rule meant to hold for the rest of the session decays
  after its turn. Repository-owned invariants stay in `AGENTS.md`; plugin-owned
  policy should be injected by the plugin as a concise context kernel; detailed
  procedures stay in the skill (see `customizing-copilot:authoring-skills`
  § *sessionStart context injection*);
- **contradictory rules** between `AGENTS.md`, skills, and hooks;
- hook or plugin designs without explicit context ownership and composition;
- Task-capable sub-agents missing the agent-specific **anti-recursion** guard,
  and MCP-owning agents missing readiness / equivalent fallback behavior;
- plugin-packaged MCP agents with no discoverable troubleshooting skill, or a
  plugin README that leaves runtime/plugin/authentication dependencies implicit;
- **footguns** — destructive commands without confirmation, hardcoded paths,
  raw IPs in SSH, secrets in config;
- instructions that tell the agent to *do* something no surface can express
  (e.g. expecting a hook to originate a turn).

Feed it the actual file contents (not summaries) and act on high-signal
findings.

### 2. Conformance check (authoring skills)

Cross-check each artifact against the skill that governs its format:

| Artifact | Check against | Look for |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Skills | **`authoring-skills`** | frontmatter (`name`, `description` with triggers), folder convention, description length, discoverable triggers |
| Sub-agents | **`defining-subagents`** | `.agent.md` frontmatter, bounded direct-execution contract, Task-capability, per-agent MCP ownership, anti-recursion pattern |
| MCP servers | **`registering-mcp-servers`** | registration scope (per-agent vs project vs global), config shape, env substitution, no inline secrets |
| Plugin registration | **`installing-plugins`** | repo `settings.json` (`extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`), payload-vs-runtime, no "just in case" plugins |
| Instructions | this skill + `authoring-skills` | `AGENTS.md` is a lean map with repository-owned invariants/fail-safes; plugin ambient policy uses config-backed injection; declared static projections are locked, provenance-marked, bounded, and free of dynamic state; skills hold detailed procedures |

## Output and follow-through

Produce a **prioritized findings list** (blocking vs non-blocking), each with the
file and the concrete fix. Then:

- **Fix the minor issues in place** — trigger tweaks, missing frontmatter,
  format nits, obvious contradictions — with atomic commits.
- **Surface the structural ones** to the operator — skills that should merge,
  a missing anti-recursion guard, an instruction that needs a new surface —
  before acting, since they change design.
- **Treat external-plugin findings as upstream work.** Do not edit the installed
  payload. Configure/disable it locally or use the reported source and
  contribution path to fix the owning repository.

Re-run after fixes until the design critique is clean and every artifact
conforms.
