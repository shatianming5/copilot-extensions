# Authoring Skills

How to write Copilot CLI **skills** -- task-specific instruction bundles loaded
on demand -- plus the two always-/lifecycle-adjacent surfaces that pair with
them: **hooks** and **custom instructions**. This supplements knowledge the
Copilot CLI does not ship natively.

> **Declarative first.** Skills, custom instructions, hooks, sub-agents, and MCP
> servers are *declarative* surfaces -- prefer them. The CLI also has an
> *imperative* **Extensions API** (a JS `extension.mjs` calling `joinSession`),
> but it is heavier and **may be on its way out**: the native runtime (1.0.66+)
> already **removed extension SDK callback hooks**, and the declarative hook
> system below now covers what they did -- including injecting `additionalContext`
> into the model. Reach for an extension only when no declarative surface fits.

## Two ways to add an in-repo skill or agent — prefer the local-plugin model

Before writing a skill or sub-agent for a repo, decide **how it is packaged**:

| Approach | What it is | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Local plugin** (preferred) | The skill/agent is a plugin in the repo's **in-repo `.ai` local marketplace** (`.ai/<name>/skills/...` or `.ai/<name>/agents/...`), declared via a `directory` marketplace source in `.github/copilot/settings.json`. | **Default.** Whenever it should be modular, individually toggleable, travel with the repo, and compose across contexts (repo launched directly, consumed by another harness, or dispatched to via agent-bridge). |
| **Loose local skill / agent** | A bare `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md` (or `.copilot/…`). Loaded directly by the runtime, no marketplace. | A quick one-off / experiment, or a repo that deliberately wants a single flat set with no plugin packaging. Simplest to create; loads **only** for the launch repo. |

**Prefer the local-plugin model when practical.** It costs one extra `plugin.json`
+ a `marketplace.json` entry, but it makes each capability independently
enable-able, reviewable, and portable — and it is the only form that loads when
the repo is *consumed* rather than *launched* (a bound data/knowledge repo, an
a bridge dispatch target). Use a loose skill/agent only when that portability
genuinely doesn't matter.

> **The two are otherwise identical to author.** A skill is the same `SKILL.md`
> and a sub-agent the same `.agent.md` either way — the *only* differences are
> **where the file lives** (`.ai/<name>/skills/<name>/` vs `.github/skills/<name>/`)
> and, for a plugin, the small `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`
> entry + the `directory` marketplace declaration. See the `installing-plugins`
> skill (§ *the `.ai` local marketplace*) for the packaging + **required
> marketplace declaration** mechanics; this skill covers authoring the SKILL.md
> itself.

## Skills

A skill is a SKILL.md file (and optional companion resources) in a named
subdirectory. Copilot auto-discovers skills from known locations and loads them
when relevant.

### Locations

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| Project | `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, or `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` |
| Personal | `~/.copilot/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` or `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` |
| Plugin | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (shipped by an enabled plugin) |
| In-repo plugin (`.ai`) | `.ai/<capability>/skills/<capability>/SKILL.md` — a plugin in the repo's own **local marketplace**, enabled via a `directory` source in `.github/copilot/settings.json`. **Preferred** for a repo's modular, individually-toggleable, travels-with-the-repo skills; see the `installing-plugins` skill. |

Add extra search paths with `/skills add`.

> **Choosing a home for a repo's own skill.** See § *Two ways to add an in-repo
> skill or agent* above — prefer the **`.ai` local-plugin** model over a loose
> `.github/skills/<name>/` (which loads only for the launch repo), and remember
> the `.ai` marketplace **must be declared** in `.github/copilot/settings.json`
> (`installing-plugins` → *the `.ai` local marketplace*).

### SKILL.md format

YAML frontmatter (`name` required, `description` required, `license` optional)
followed by markdown instructions. The description drives auto-matching -- be
specific about trigger conditions.

- **`name`** -- lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only; max 64 chars; no
  reserved words (`anthropic`, `claude`). Prefer gerund form (`authoring-skills`,
  `processing-pdfs`).
- **`description`** -- non-empty, max **1024 characters**, third person, no XML
  tags. State both **what** the skill does and **when** to use it, with concrete
  trigger terms.

### Per-skill folder convention

Lay every skill out the same way so companion files are discoverable and the
SKILL.md stays a lean table of contents:

```
<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md            # required: frontmatter (name + description) + body
  references/         # companion docs the SKILL.md points to, loaded on demand
    <topic>.md
  scripts/            # executable utilities the agent RUNS (not loaded as text)
  assets/             # templates / fixtures the skill copies or fills in
```

Rules:

- **Only `SKILL.md` lives at the top level.** Everything else goes in
  `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` -- don't scatter loose `.md` siblings.
- **`references/`** holds prose the SKILL.md links to (progressive disclosure).
  Keep links **one level deep** from SKILL.md -- no nested reference chains.
  **Decompose liberally:** SKILL.md is loaded whole when the skill triggers, but a
  `references/` doc is fetched **only when the agent follows the link**. So bias
  toward a lean SKILL.md that links out to focused reference docs — pull each large,
  self-contained topic (a deep procedure, a full schema, a worked example set) into
  `references/<topic>.md` and leave a one-line pointer. That keeps per-trigger
  context small; the trade is an extra read on demand. Link out *and* back; no
  orphan references. The same bias applies to any long doc a skill owns.
- **Keep the skill body target-agnostic — factor target-specific reactions into a
  linked "troubleshooting"/"errata" reference, indexed by target.** A skill teaches a
  *general* procedure; the specific ways one downstream **target/project** reacts to it
  (a build target that fails on stderr, a service that rejects a header, a repo whose CI
  flags a warning) are **errata**, not general guidance — inlining them into the body
  bloats it, dates it, and privileges one target over the skill's general audience.
  Instead keep a `references/errata/` (or `references/troubleshooting.md`) **index
  broken down by target/project**, add a row + a focused file per quirk, and give the
  skill body a single neutral *"Troubleshooting specific errors"* pointer to the index.
  The body then stays stable and general as targets come and go.
- **`scripts/`** holds code the agent **executes by path** ("run `scripts/x.py`")
  rather than pasting inline -- more reliable, fewer tokens.
- **`assets/`** holds templates/fixtures (e.g. a `TEMPLATE.md` the skill copies).
- **Use forward slashes** in skill-internal references so they resolve on every
  platform (documenting an OS-specific *command* path is fine).
- **Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines — and split *before* that when a topic can
  stand alone.** 500 is the ceiling, not a target; move detail into `references/`
  proactively at a natural seam and leave a pointer.

### Validation checklist

When creating or modifying a skill, validate against Anthropic's best practices:

- **Description:** specific, third-person, includes key trigger terms, under
  1024 chars. Avoid "I can" / "You can use this".
- **Body:** under 500 lines. Split into companion files if larger.
- **Conciseness:** only add context the agent doesn't already have. Challenge
  each paragraph: does it justify its token cost?
- **Degrees of freedom:** match specificity to fragility -- exact commands for
  fragile ops, high-level guidance for flexible tasks.
- **No time-sensitive data.** Use "old patterns" sections if needed.
- **Progressive disclosure + folder structure:** per the convention above.
- **Consistent terminology:** one term per concept throughout.

### Invocation & CLI

- **Explicit:** `/skill-name` in a prompt. **Auto-match:** Copilot matches the
  prompt against skill descriptions and loads relevant skills automatically.
- Commands: `/skills list`, `/skills info`, `/skills` (toggle), `/skills add`,
  `/skills reload`, `/skills remove DIR`. The same list/add/remove operations
  are available outside an interactive session as `copilot skill list`,
  `copilot skill add <FILE|URL|DIRECTORY>`, and `copilot skill remove ...`.

### Referencing skills or agents from another plugin

When a skill (or its docs/references) refers to a skill or sub-agent **shipped by
a different plugin**, name it in the **namespaced `plugin:name` form** — e.g. the
`agent-bridge` skill in the agent-bridge plugin is `agent-bridge:agent-bridge`,
agent-worktrees' worktree skill is `agent-worktrees:worktree`, and the
the logger writer agent is `agent-logger:session-log-writer`. This disambiguates
same-named skills across plugins and tells the reader (and the agent) exactly
which plugin owns it. **Within the same plugin, keep the bare name** — only
*cross-plugin* references are namespaced. The same rule applies to a sub-agent's
`agent_type` (see the defining-subagents skill).

### Skills vs custom instructions

Use **custom instructions** for simple, always-on guidance (coding standards,
repo conventions). Use **skills** for detailed, task-specific instructions
Copilot should load only when relevant.

### Action-sequence skills vs ambient-guidance skills

A skill's guidance applies **most strongly during the turn it is invoked**, and
fades on later turns. Author with that grain, not against it:

- **Action-sequence skills** — a procedure the agent runs *now* (setup steps, a
  deploy flow, a review pass). These fit the model perfectly: the sequence is
  consumed in-turn. Write them as concrete, ordered steps.
- **Ambient-guidance skills** — standing rules meant to hold for the *rest of
  the session* (a voice/persona, a style bar, a safety discipline). A one-shot
  skill body decays after its turn, so the guidance quietly stops applying.
  Put the durable guidance in its authoritative always-on channel: genuinely
  repository-owned invariants stay in `AGENTS.md` / custom instructions, while
  generic plugin-owned policy is injected by that plugin as a concise
  `sessionStart` context kernel. Keep detailed mechanics in a skill or linked
  file and have the kernel point at them with a faux-link. The skill's job is
  the task-time procedure, not a transient or materialized copy of ambient
  policy.

This preserves one owner for each rule and prevents both skill decay and
`AGENTS.md` bloat. Follow *sessionStart dynamic guidance* below when a plugin
owns the ambient policy.

## Custom Instructions

Always-on context injected into every prompt.

| Scope | File |
|-------|------|
| Repo (always loaded) | `AGENTS.md` in git root and cwd |
| Repo (always loaded) | `CLAUDE.md` in git root and cwd |
| Repo (always loaded) | `GEMINI.md` in git root and cwd |
| Repo (always loaded) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Repo (always loaded) | `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` |
| Personal (all repos) | `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Personal (all repos) | `~/.copilot/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` |
| Host/machine-scoped (deployed) | a generated instructions directory loaded via `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` |

Suppress with `--no-custom-instructions`.

> **Static instructions dir vs. a dynamic `sessionStart` hook.** The
> `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` row is a **static** delivery: a plugin
> deploys `*.instructions.md` files into a directory and the launcher injects the
> dir path, so the *same bytes* load into every session for that project. When the
> guidance is **computed at session start** or must be **targeted by which repo
> the session is in**, an output-free `sessionStart` **hook** that writes an
> exact-session guidance file (see *sessionStart dynamic guidance* below) is the
> better delivery: the hook runs a script that can read
> live state and the session's `cwd`, so a single globally-installed plugin writes
> *different* context per repo -- something a fixed instructions dir cannot do. It
> also removes the launcher's `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`-injection
> dependency for launch paths that load plugin hooks. Some headless/cloud paths
> do not load plugin hooks, so irreducible safety and publication rules still
> need a minimal static fail-safe there. Prefer the static dir for truly
> fixed, always-identical text; reach for the hook when the payload is dynamic,
> conditional, or repo-scoped. Hook output is bounded, and injected text shares
> the model's context budget, so keep it lean:
> inline only what every turn needs and **point at a file** (a backtick faux-link
> the agent reads on demand) for the rest.

**Avoid auto-load in AGENTS.md:** Copilot follows valid Markdown links in
custom-instruction files and auto-loads them. Reference docs with backtick code
spans (`` `docs/tools.md` ``), not `[text](path)` links, so Copilot reads files
on demand instead of loading them into every session.

**Build `AGENTS.md` as a waypoint, not a dumping ground.** The root `AGENTS.md`
is the first thing an agent reads on entering a repo -- including one arriving
from *another* repo (see the **`agent-worktrees:working-cross-repo`** skill) -- so it should read
as a **map**: orient the reader and link out (backtick faux-links) to the
detailed homes (`docs/`, `visions/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the connective-tissue
skills) rather than inlining reference detail that has a home elsewhere.

**What stays inline vs links out depends on the repo's *purpose*** -- `AGENTS.md`
is the always-on instruction file, so keep what the session genuinely needs
*every turn* and link the rest:

- A **control harness** (the agent *is* the operator) keeps repository-owned
  identity, irreducible local invariants, and minimal fail-safes inline. Generic
  plugin-owned ambient policy is injected by its owner; the repository should
  configure or override it rather than copy it. `AGENTS.md` still faux-links
  reference material instead of pasting it.
- A **product / library / marketplace** repo (the agent is a *contributor*, not
  a persona) carries little always-on guidance, so its `AGENTS.md` is a
  mostly-navigational contributor guide -- a lean map with a few contribution
  invariants.

The shared failure mode is an `AGENTS.md` bloated with *reference* detail agents
must crawl, or that auto-loads the tree every session. Factor *reference* detail
out; keep repository-owned ambient guidance and fail-safes inline, and inject
plugin-owned ambient policy from its owner.

## Hooks

Shell commands that run at agent lifecycle points. The `preToolUse` hook can
**block** tool execution -- the primary mechanism for guardrails and policy
enforcement. Config lives in policy, user-level `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\hooks\*.json` on Windows), repository/project
`.github/hooks/*.json`, inline `hooks` blocks in Copilot settings, and
plugin-declared `hooks.json`. Cloud agent reads only `.github/hooks/*.json` from
the cloned repository.

### Config format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "./scripts/check.sh",
        "powershell": "./scripts/check.ps1",
        "cwd": ".",
        "env": { "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO" },
        "timeoutSec": 15
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Events

Configure events in **camelCase** (native, fields camelCase) or **PascalCase**
(VS Code / Claude-compatible, fields snake_case). Command hooks are the default;
**`http`** hooks POST the payload to a URL, and **`prompt`** hooks (`sessionStart`
only, and **new interactive sessions only** -- not resume, not `-p`) auto-submit
text or a slash command.

| Event | Fires when | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `sessionStart` | New or resumed session begins | Can inject **`additionalContext`** |
| `sessionEnd` | Session completes or terminates | Ignored |
| `userPromptSubmitted` | User submits a prompt | Command/HTTP output ignored; SDK programmatic hooks can rewrite |
| `userPromptTransformed` | Prompt is transformed into model-facing content | Can rewrite `modifiedTransformedPrompt` |
| `preToolUse` | Before any tool invocation | **Allow/deny/modify** -- `{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}` or `modifiedArgs` |
| `postToolUse` | After a tool completes successfully | **Inject `additionalContext`** (appended to the result, same turn) or `modifiedResult` |
| `postToolUseFailure` | After a tool fails | Recovery guidance via **`additionalContext`** |
| `notification` | Async CLI notification (`shell_completed`, `agent_completed`, `agent_idle`, `permission_prompt`, ...) | Can inject **`additionalContext`**; fire-and-forget, never blocks |
| `permissionRequest` | Before the permission service runs | `{"behavior":"allow"|"deny"}` (CLI only; great for `-p`/CI) |
| `preCompact` | Before context compaction (manual/auto) | Ignored |
| `agentStop` | Main agent finishes a turn | **Block** -- `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` forces another turn |
| `subagentStart` | A sub-agent is spawned | `additionalContext` prepended to its prompt |
| `subagentStop` | Sub-agent completes | **Block** (force another turn) |
| `errorOccurred` | Error during agent execution | Ignored |

> **`additionalContext` is the declarative way to talk to the model.** Several
> events (`postToolUse`, `notification`, `sessionStart`, `postToolUseFailure`)
> let a hook write `{"additionalContext": "..."}` to stdout and the string is
> surfaced to the model. This is the supported replacement for the **removed**
> extension SDK `onPostToolUse` callback: a command hook can read a small
> **state file** (e.g. a sidecar maintained by a background process) and inject
> a nudge when some condition holds -- no `extension.mjs` required. Multiple
> `postToolUse` hooks' `additionalContext` values are joined with a double
> newline and capped at 10 KB. `sessionStart` has no documented 10 KB cap; the
> command-hook output envelope is bounded at 10 MiB, but startup context should
> still use an intentional, much smaller budget. Output composition is
> event/field-specific: all matching hooks running does not imply that duplicate
> output fields survive. See
> [`references/hook-output-composition.md`](references/hook-output-composition.md)
> for the ordering contract and the open `sessionStart`/`subagentStart`
> `additionalContext` work.

> **Hooks are reactive -- they can't originate or schedule a turn.** Every hook
> fires in response to activity the session is already producing. The only hook
> that injects a *follow-up prompt* is `agentStop` with
> `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` (the `reason` becomes a new user turn,
> verified) -- but it fires only at a turn boundary, so it's a continuation
> loop, **not a scheduler**, and never fires once the agent is idle. No hook
> fires on a clock or from an external/async event; `notification` is
> fire-and-forget, has no turn-forcing output, and does not fire in
> non-interactive mode. Waking an idle session asynchronously (callbacks, peer
> messaging, scheduled prompts) still needs `session.send()` (an extension) or
> the runtime's own scheduled prompts -- not a hook.

### Plugin-contributed hooks

A plugin ships hooks in a **`hooks.json`** (or `hooks/hooks.json`) at the root of
its install dir, same `{ "version": 1, "hooks": { ... } }` format as a repo's
`.github/hooks/*.json`. The runtime collects matching hooks by supported source
tier -- **policy -> user -> repository/project -> plugins** -- and every
matching entry runs. Entries within one event array retain authored order.
Relative order among plugins is not alphabetical and is not an author-facing
priority contract. `enabledPlugins` is an enablement/precedence map, not a hook
queue; its JSON key order must never arrange a winner. Full ordering and output
composition guidance is in
[`references/hook-output-composition.md`](references/hook-output-composition.md).
Two further consequences shape how a plugin author writes hooks:

- **A plugin hook fires for every session the plugin loads into** -- there is no
  per-repo `matcher` on `sessionStart`. A repo-scoped plugin's hooks fire only in
  its repo, but a **globally**-installed plugin's `sessionStart` hook fires in
  *every* repo. So the hook **script must self-gate**: read the payload's `cwd`
  (and `source`) from stdin and decide whether -- and what -- to emit. This
  cwd-gating is what lets one plugin **target its emission at the calling repo**
  (the whole premise of using a hook to replace a per-project instructions dir).
- **Resolve the plugin's own files from the plugin root, not the session
  repository.** Copilot CLI supplies `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `PLUGIN_ROOT`, and
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to plugin command hooks, and an absent/empty hook `cwd`
  defaults to that plugin payload root. Prefer `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT`, keep the
  aliases for compatibility, and build the script's absolute path from that
  root. This works for installed marketplace payloads and in-repo
  directory-source plugins without hardcoding
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/...`.
  The hook's **process CWD is therefore not the session target**: read `cwd` and
  `sessionId` from the JSON payload on stdin, and use `COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR` when
  the repository root is needed. Guard the resolved script with `Test-Path` /
  `[ -f ]`, diagnose a missing root or script to stderr, and emit `{}` so a
  partial install fails open. A deployed runtime sidecar under `~/.<tool>/bin/`
  remains appropriate when the hook intentionally calls runtime code rather
  than payload code. Keep it under the perf budget below; do expensive work in
  a background process and have the hook read a cheap state file.
- **ACP is trust-gated.** Repo-scoped plugin hooks need a persisted-trusted cwd;
  user-scoped hooks do not. Repository `.github/hooks` do not load over ACP; use the runtime-context reference below and keep the static fail-safe.

The complete path/CWD/session-ID contract for hooks, stdio MCP servers,
JavaScript extensions, and plugin LSP servers is
[`references/plugin-runtime-context.md`](../../references/plugin-runtime-context.md).
Use that matrix whenever a plugin script needs both its payload location and the
repository Copilot is targeting.

### sessionStart dynamic guidance

`sessionStart` is the declarative replacement for a deployed
`COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` instructions dir: a command hook reads the
start payload from stdin and writes `{"additionalContext": "<guidance>"}`, and the
string is injected into the session as context -- **dynamically computed, and
targeted by `cwd`**. Unlike a **`prompt`**-type `sessionStart` hook (new
interactive sessions only -- not resume, not `-p`), the `additionalContext`
mechanism also applies on **resume**, so it can carry the always-on guidance an
instructions file used to.

#### Start-hook composition rule

Do not make a plugin last by name, `enabledPlugins` key position, marketplace
order, or observed inventory. Plugin authors cannot safely rely on running last,
and harness owners must not use ambient plugin order as arbitration. The current
supported runtime floor does not reliably preserve every plugin-owned
`sessionStart` `additionalContext` value, so do not assemble critical ambient
guidance through several direct output hooks.

Use a checked-in static instruction pointer plus an output-free `sessionStart`
writer for dynamic guidance. The writer validates `sessionId`, writes beneath
that exact session's `instructions/<plugin>/` directory, and emits only `{}`.
Declare the hook as `sideEffects: restart-safe-idempotent`, `context: none` so
the customization scanner can prove that a stack of independent writers and
other side effects has no competing model output.

A single direct non-empty `sessionStart` output remains composition-safe. More
than one possible non-empty output fails the scanner unless the supported host
version floor has proven native merge semantics for that event and field. When
that proof exists, direct plugin-owned output becomes the preferred fully
dynamic path; remove the static compatibility pointer only through an explicit
migration. Do not introduce a custom cross-plugin authority, rendezvous,
resolver, wrapper, cache, or spill engine in the meantime. The current and
future contracts are documented in
[`references/hook-output-composition.md`](references/hook-output-composition.md).

For an output-free plugin hook, publish a complete `session-context.json`
declaration from `plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "copilot-extensions.session-context-contributors",
  "version": 1,
  "complete": true,
  "contributors": [],
  "sessionStart": {
    "sideEffects": "restart-safe-idempotent",
    "context": "none"
  }
}
```

The historical schema name is retained for compatibility, but an empty
`contributors` list plus `context: none` is now the useful contract: it proves
the hook cannot participate in an output collision. Keep real bootstrap,
registration, and exact-session file writes direct, bounded, idempotent, and
restart-safe.

Hook payload/writer shape:

```json
{"sessionId":"<runtime-provided value>","cwd":"/path/to/repository","source":"<runtime-provided value>"}
```

```text
read one JSON payload from stdin using the platform standard library
validate sessionId against the runtime session-identifier shape; if invalid, emit {} and stop
extract cwd and source without assuming a source vocabulary
resolve cwd and applicable repository markers/config to canonical paths
if cwd/config proves applicability and source is not explicitly excluded:
    render "[owner: example-plugin@1.2.3]\n<concise kernel>"
else:
    render nothing
atomically write the rendered content (or an explicit "unavailable" status) beneath
    that exact session's instructions/<plugin>/session-guidance.instructions.md
emit {} unconditionally
```

Reference output (always, regardless of what the writer rendered to the file):

```json
{}
```

Discipline (context is a **shared, intentionally budgeted** resource):

- **Inline only what every turn needs**; for the rest, inject a short pointer -- a
  one-line summary plus a **backtick faux-link** to a file the agent reads on
  demand (`` `~/.my-tool/notes.md` ``) -- rather than pasting the whole document.
- **Split the exact-session file itself: computed facts only, explainer stays
  static.** A writer's content is rarely all dynamic. Field meanings, why a
  summary is bounded/curated rather than exhaustive, and which live commands to
  run for the complete picture are **not** computed this session -- they're
  identical every time. Put that prose in a second, ordinary static projection
  (its own `instructions/<topic>.instructions.md` + `instruction-projections.json`
  entry, checked in and reviewed like any other static fail-safe); let the
  exact-session file carry only the values that had to be resolved this session
  (paths, bindings, a live command's `argv`, a config-derived summary). Both
  files load independently and automatically -- neither depends on the other's
  presence. See `docs/patterns/session-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md` §2a for the
  worked example.
- **Mark ownership.** Begin every injected kernel with a stable owner marker:
  the plugin name, preferably plus its version. Budget reports and diagnostics
  need to attribute the emitted bytes.
- **Self-gate hard on applicability.** Render nothing (an explicit "unavailable"
  status, not a partial nudge) when resolved cwd/config does not prove the
  policy applies. Prefer a capability or repository marker; use configured
  target-root lists only as a fallback. Never use substring matching or
  repository-name inference.
- **Allow source by default.** Source is an opaque runtime value. Exclude only
  explicitly documented incompatible sources; do not invent an allowlist. An
  exact-session writer file applies on resume, so preserve resume behavior.
- **Treat configuration as data with bounded delegation.** Apply documented
  repository-over-operator-over-default precedence only for an explicit
  plugin-declared allowlist of repo-delegable keys. Reject unknown keys and
  unauthorized repository overrides. Safety, publication, attribution, and
  sanitization policy remains operator/plugin-owned and non-overridable. Never
  source, import, or execute configuration.
- **Fail open.** Missing optional config or writer errors leave the writer
  emitting `{}` and may log to stderr; they do not block startup. Retain a
  minimal static fail-safe for critical rules on launch paths that do not load
  plugin hooks.
- **Own written fallbacks.** If setup writes compatibility/fallback prose into
  `AGENTS.md` or custom instructions, idempotently reconcile it inside a stable
  region naming the plugin (or a dedicated plugin-named rule file). Future setup
  versions use the same marker to update, shrink, or remove the fallback without
  duplicate text or collateral edits.
- **Prefer exact-session files over direct startup output** when the guidance is
  dynamic (machine/account/state-derived), conditional, or repo-scoped; keep
  static projections for the load-before-action pointer or genuinely identical
  fallback text.

This section is the portable normative summary for installed skills. The suite
design rationale remains in the copilot-extensions repository's
`docs/patterns/session-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`.

### Script I/O

- **Input:** read all of stdin as JSON (`jq` in bash, `ConvertFrom-Json` in
  PowerShell). Tool hooks also receive `toolName` / `toolArgs`; post-tool hooks
  include `toolResult`.
- **Output:** a single JSON object on stdout. Decision/injection events read it
  -- `preToolUse` (`permissionDecision`/`modifiedArgs`), `postToolUse` /
  `postToolUseFailure` / `notification` / `sessionStart` / `subagentStart`
  (`additionalContext`),
  `permissionRequest` (`behavior`), `agentStop` (`decision`). Emit **exactly
  one** final JSON object (progress lines `{"type":"progress",...}` are stripped
  first; two decision objects concatenate into invalid JSON and are ignored).
  Other events ignore stdout.
- **Stderr:** debug logging, ignored. **Exit code:** 0 = success.
- **Performance:** hooks run synchronously and block the agent -- keep them under
  5 seconds; background expensive work.
