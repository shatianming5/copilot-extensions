  Ship an operator-harness plugin for a repo -- the <repo>-harness standard. A
  payload-only plugin, authored by a repo's owner, that provides the skills to
  work ON that repo (contribute + diagnose), portable to any control repo that
  enables it. Use when a repo should ship its own operator skills instead of
  every consumer hand-writing a per-repo narrative.

# Authoring Harness Plugins

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
the related-repository operation below. Replace
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with the raw path and quote it at the shell
call site on POSIX; in PowerShell invoke it as
`& "<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>" <args>`.

The **`<repo>-harness`** standard: a repo ships its own *operator harness* — a
payload-only Copilot CLI plugin that teaches an agent how to work **on** that
repo. Instead of every downstream control repo hand-writing a per-repo narrative,
the repo owner authors the operator skills **once**, versions them with the repo,
and any consumer adopts them with one `enabledPlugins` line.

The reference implementation is **`copilot-extensions-harness`** in the
copilot-extensions repo — read it as the template.

## When to author one

Ship a harness plugin when a repo is **operated on by agents from other repos**
and the "how to work on it" knowledge is worth centralizing — a shared library,
a service, a plugin suite, a tool others deploy or debug. If only one control
repo ever touches it, a plain related-narrative is enough; the plugin earns its
keep when the knowledge is reused or safety-critical.

## Harness plugin vs related-narrative

| | Harness plugin (`<repo>-harness`) | Related narrative |
|---|---|---|
| Authored by | the repo **owner**, once | each **consumer**, per control repo |
| Ships from | the target repo (marketplace) | the consumer's control repo |
| POV | neutral, portable | that consumer's POV |
| Versioning | tracks the repo it describes | tracks the consumer repo |

They **compose**: a consumer enables the harness plugin for the authoritative
operator skills and keeps a thin narrative (or trigger-redirect skill) only for
consumer-specific facts (which machines deploy it, local policy, adoption
status). Substance in the plugin; keep the narrative thin.

## The standard

1. **Name it `<repo>-harness`** — e.g. `copilot-extensions-harness`,
   `my-service-harness`. This is the repo-scoped **suffix** family; the token
   placement carries meaning, so name to the taxonomy:

   | Pattern | Means | Installs where |
   |---------|-------|----------------|
   | `agent-<thing>` | adds capability `<thing>` to the **general agent** | broadly (infra) |
   | `harness-<thing>` | adds capability `<thing>` to the **general harness** | broadly (infra) |
   | **`<repo>-harness`** | **harness-side** plugin to work ON / **control** `<repo>` from a control plane | the **control harness**, never `<repo>` itself |
   | `<repo>-agent` | **in-repo** agent capabilities for `<repo>` | `<repo>`'s own venue, never outside it |

   A harness plugin authored here is the **`<repo>-harness`** case: it targets a
   *specific repo* (not a general capability of the harness), so the repo name
   leads and `harness` is the suffix. Leading with the repo name also groups a
   repo's plugins together (`<repo>-agent`, `<repo>-harness`, …) in a `plugins/`
   listing and an `enabledPlugins` map. Two propagation rules follow from the
   family:
   - **Never install a `<repo>-harness` into `<repo>` itself** — it's control-plane
     side, for an *external* operator of the repo.
   - **Never install a `<repo>-agent` outside `<repo>` itself** — it's in-context,
     only meaningful inside that repo's venue.
2. **Payload-only.** No runtime, no venv — it ships skills. Enabling it is the
   whole install. (See `installing-plugins` for the payload-vs-runtime model.)
3. **POV-neutral.** Write for *any* adopter, not one control repo. Don't bake in
   a specific machine, operator, or multi-machine system. Resolve the checkout path at
   runtime; never hardcode it.
4. **Point at the repo's own authoritative docs.** The skills are the operator's
   map; the repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `AGENTS.md` / architecture docs remain the
   versioned source of truth. Reference them rather than duplicating detail that
   drifts.
5. **Own generic ambient policy.** If the harness plugin carries policy that
   must remain active throughout a session, keep it config-backed and inject a
   concise `sessionStart` context kernel from the plugin. Leave repository
   identity, local invariants, and minimal safety/publication fail-safes in the
   target repository's lean `AGENTS.md`; keep detailed procedures in skills.
   The dividing line between the two surfaces is not "static vs. dynamic" by
   itself -- it's audience and resolvability: `AGENTS.md` is the universal
   visitor contract, correct for any agent regardless of home base, while
   `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` is where a harness resolves facts
   that are only correct *this session* (a resolved config value, current
   branch-protection state, a live topology fact). See
   [`docs/patterns/agents-md-vs-instructions-split.md`](../../../../docs/patterns/agents-md-vs-instructions-split.md)
   for the full heuristic and a worked precedent.
   Hard-gate the hook by resolved cwd/config applicability, treat source as
   allow-by-default with documented exclusions, preserve bounded
   operator-versus-repo precedence, provide Bash/PowerShell parity, and fail open. Some
   launch paths do not load plugin hooks, and over the **ACP transport**
   repo-scoped plugin hooks are folder-trust-gated (they fire for
   worktree-manager-trusted sessions, but not an untrusted ACP `cwd`), while repo
   `.github/hooks` never load over ACP at all. Do not remove or shrink a fuller
   static policy until the plugin's stable marked fallback is installed and
   every known hook-less or trust-gated launch path is validated. Follow
   `customizing-copilot:authoring-skills` § *sessionStart context injection*.

## README & documentation standard (every plugin)

A plugin's `README.md` is its entry point — the #1 cause of "usage isn't clear" is a
README that lists features without setting expectations. This applies to **any** plugin
(harness, agent, skill, or runtime), and mirrors the agency-microsoft
[`plugin-eval`](https://github.com/agency-microsoft/.github-private/tree/main/plugins/plugin-eval)
quality rubric (structural checks + LLM-as-judge dimensions). Every README must give a
coherent narrative covering five things, in order:

| # | Requirement | Section |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | What the plugin is **for** | Title + one-line `>` purpose + a 1–2 paragraph intro (state the `-harness`/`-agent` role if applicable). |
| 2 | What it **does** & how to **use** it | **What it does (and how to use it)** — a table of entry points (skills + trigger phrases, agents `@name`, commands) + a short usage walkthrough / concrete example. |
| 3 | What it **depends on / assumes** | **What this plugin provides — and what it doesn't** (Provides / Does NOT provide-delegated / Assumes) + **Dependencies & assumptions**. |
| 4 | Pointer to an **inventory** | **What's in this plugin** — one line per skill/agent/script/reference; note the SKILL.md files are the source of truth for behavior. |
| 5 | **Issues / contributing** | **Troubleshooting, contributing & issues** — top 2–3 failure modes + fixes; how to contribute (the repo's PR flow); where to file issues. |

Non-negotiables:

- **Set expectations honestly.** The *"provides — and what it doesn't"* section is the
  fix for unclear usage: name what the plugin **delegates**, leaves **manual**, or only
  **partially** does. A `-harness` plugin especially must state which config/artifacts it
  **produces** vs. **assumes** — an operator should never discover after install that
  "set up X" silently required hand-writing three config files.
- **Document real dependencies explicitly.** Current Copilot CLI plugin
  manifests do not enforce transitive plugin installation, so if a skill *cannot
  function* without another plugin's sub-agent/MCP/skill, the README and adoption
  snippet must say that the consumer must enable both plugins. Every
  `@sub-agent` / MCP a README mentions is either a required companion that is
  shown in `enabledPlugins`, or an explicitly-documented optional companion with
  graceful degradation.
- **MCP-owning agents need a troubleshooting skill.** If the plugin packages an
  agent with `mcp-servers`, ship a discoverable troubleshooting/diagnostic skill
  for setup, authentication, bridge/catalog, and upstream failure modes. Keep
  the plugin README's dependency/prerequisite section explicit enough that an
  operator can satisfy those requirements before invoking the agent.
- **No dead references** — every file/skill/plugin you link must exist.
- **Bump the manifest + marketplace catalog version together** on any change (README
  included).

`reviewing-customizations` checks structural coherence; this section is the content bar it
can't fully see.

## Structure

```
plugins/<repo>-harness/
  plugin.json                                  # payload-only manifest
  README.md                                    # overview + the <repo>-harness standard note
  skills/
    contributing-to-<repo>/SKILL.md            # how to change + land work in the repo
    diagnosing-<repo>/SKILL.md                 # symptom -> cause -> action for its deployed artifacts
```

`plugin.json` mirrors any payload-only plugin — `name`, `description`,
`version`, and `"skills": "skills/"` (skills auto-discover from the folder). See
`authoring-skills` for `SKILL.md` frontmatter and the folder convention.

### Contribute the target repo's locus by-install (`.agent-worktrees/related.yaml`)

A `<repo>-harness` plugin **may ship a `.agent-worktrees/related.yaml` in its own
payload** to contribute its target repo's related entry — `role`, `locus`
(e.g. a CodeSpace/container venue), and `delegate` — so that **merely installing
the plugin** makes `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> related resolve <repo>`
work, with no
hand-authored config in the operator's control plane. agent-worktrees discovers
these by convention: it sweeps installed plugins for a shipped
`.agent-worktrees/related.yaml` and grafts them in as the **lowest-precedence**
config layer (see agent-worktrees `related.installed_plugin_related_anchors`).

Rules for a plugin-shipped `related.yaml`:

- **Ship only your own repo's entry** (or entries you own) — one `related:` block,
  keyed by the global-registry name. Don't ship other repos' entries.
- **Never set `primary:`** — a plugin contributes *named* entries but must never
  dictate the harness's primary project. Any `primary:` in a plugin payload is
  ignored by the grafter.
- **Lowest precedence:** the operator's own base/knowledge/user `related.yaml`
  entry of the same name **overrides** the plugin's wholesale, so an operator can
  always tune or replace it.
- **Provisioning is separate.** This brings *discovery/resolution* (locus +
  delegate); a venue's own provisioning config (e.g. a CodeSpace's
  `.agent-codespaces/` vessel block) is a separate concern owned by that venue's
  plugin — see the next section.

### Provision a CodeSpace venue by-install (repo provenance + in-venue plugins)

When your repo's venue is a **GitHub CodeSpace** (no local checkout — the harness
dispatches into a `<product>-codespaces` vessel), the harness plugin can also carry
the venue's **provisioning** so a consumer gets a working `codespace:<name>`
dispatch by *just enabling three plugins* — `agent-bridge` + `agent-codespaces` +
your `<repo>-harness` — with **no control-plane repo**. `agent-codespaces` is the
honorer; declare it as a dependency, and use its two convention-discovered seams:

1. **Repo provenance via the `config.d` config-provider drop-in.** Ship a
   supplementary `.agent-codespaces/config.yaml` fragment under your
   `references/agent-codespaces/`, and add a `sessionStart` hook
   (`register-config-provider.{sh,ps1}`) that drops a **pointer** to it into
   `~/.agent-codespaces/config.d/`. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow doc-example --> The crux is
   `repos.<vessel>.workspace_repo: <product>` — it makes the dispatched agent land
   in `/workspaces/<product>` (not the vessel folder) and sets its ACP cwd. The
   drop-in merges at **lowest precedence** (a consumer's adopted config still wins)
   and writes into no repo.
2. **In-venue plugins via `codespacePlugins`.** In `plugin.json`, declare the
   plugins to inject **into** the CodeSpace on connect — your `<product>-agent` and
   friends — scoped with `forWorkspaceRepo`. `agent-codespaces` reads this custom
   field and installs them into the CodeSpace's user settings.

The full mechanism, the worked `example-web-harness` example, and the anti-patterns
are in the copilot-extensions pattern
[**docs/patterns/codespace-repo-provenance.md**](../../../../docs/patterns/codespace-repo-provenance.md).
(A heavier `setup-venue` that scaffolds config + tools into a control-plane repo,
for a full build-capable venue, is an optional add-on — **not** required for the
golden path.)

### What the two skills should contain

**`diagnosing-<repo>` is the harness's primary, hard-guidance skill** — every
consumer needs it, whether or not it ever contributes. It must give an agent
two things unconditionally:

1. **Where the deployed artifacts live** — installed payload paths, runtime
   roots, binstubs, config/enablement files — so an agent can tell at a glance
   which local scripts, processes, and files belong to this system before it
   reasons about any of them.
2. **The no-monkey-patch rule.** Never hand-edit an installed/deployed copy or
   a running runtime to work around a bug — that fix is invisible to every
   other consumer and is silently overwritten on the next update. When
   something is wrong, there are exactly two sanctioned responses: **file a bug
   upstream** (sanitized per the repo's own publication rules — no PII,
   internal paths, hostnames, or proprietary context) **or run the repo's
   auto-update/reset path**. A **symptom → cause → action** table, the key
   diagnostic commands, and a reset/baseline escape hatch round this out. Lead
   with **diagnose-before-remediate** discipline throughout.

**`contributing-to-<repo>` is secondary** — it exists for the subset of
consumers who choose to become contributors with a local checkout. It covers
repo layout; the contribution flow (branch/PR or worktree, per the repo's
policy); the **gotchas that silently swallow work** (for a marketplace repo,
the mandatory version bump); test/lint/contract gates; deploy-after-merge; and
the "edit the source, never the deployed copy" rule — the contributor-side
mirror of the no-monkey-patch rule above, for the case where the agent *is*
about to make a real, versioned fix rather than a throwaway local patch.

Two focused skills beat one sprawling skill: contributors and diagnosers arrive
with different triggers.

## Wire it into the marketplace

Register the new plugin like any other: add a `plugins[]` entry in the repo's
marketplace catalog and bump the catalog version (a new plugin is a catalog
change). Follow the repo's own release rules — the harness plugin is versioned by
the same pipeline as everything else it ships.

## How consumers adopt it

In the consumer's `.github/copilot/settings.json` (see `installing-plugins`):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "<marketplace>": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "<owner>/<repo>" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "<repo>-harness@<marketplace>": true }
}
```

Then any local `repo-<repo>` redirect skill and related-narrative can slim to a
pointer at the plugin — the operator substance now lives with the repo it
describes.

## Overlap & precedence (multiple marketplaces enabled)

Once a consumer enables several marketplaces (copilot-extensions, a team catalog,
a repo's own `/.ai`), two skills can answer the same request. **Copilot has no
precedence setting** — every enabled marketplace exposes the same root
`marketplace.json`, and enabled skills are surfaced to the model by their
**description/trigger**; the model selects by match. So you can't *declare* "my
skill wins." You engineer it, with four levers:

1. **Narrow, specific triggers beat broad ones.** Write each skill's
   `description` + trigger phrases to the *exact* task, and add explicit
   **disambiguation** — "use this for X; **not** for Y (use Z)". A precise match
   is chosen over a vague "ALWAYS invoke on all changes" skill, and the negative
   clause tells the model when to defer. Broad, imperative triggers ("ALWAYS
   invoke on ANY edit") are an anti-pattern: they shadow narrower peers — don't
   author them, and be wary of enabling plugins that do.
2. **Your `enabledPlugins` set is the availability/precedence knob.** The
   surest way a competing skill doesn't win is to **not enable it** — or to
   enable it only where it's wanted. Curate deliberately; don't blanket-enable
   a broad-trigger catalog globally. The map's JSON key order has no priority
   meaning and must never be used to arrange plugin hooks or output winners;
   see `authoring-skills`' hook ordering guidance.
3. **Scope by settings layer.** Settings compose additively across **user → repo →
   workspace** (`~/.copilot/settings.json`, a repo's `.github/copilot/settings.json`,
   a workspace file). Keep your always-on harness skills at **user** scope so
   they're present everywhere; enable a broad or repo-specific tool **narrowly**
   (repo/workspace) so it's only in play where it belongs. Narrow-trigger +
   narrow-enable *is* the precedence mechanism.
4. **Name-prefixing keeps identities unambiguous.** A plugin is addressed as
   `<plugin>@<marketplace>`, and an aggregating catalog may prefix names (e.g. a
   synced team catalog surfaces `<catalog>-<name>`). Enable the specific prefixed
   plugin you want so there's no ambiguous bare name.

**Don't encode precedence as per-skill "prefer me" notes.** A line in a skill
body that says "prefer this over the other plugin's skill for now" is a smell —
the model doesn't read one skill while choosing another, so the note never fires
at selection time. Fix overlap at the source instead: tighten your triggers
(lever 1) and curate what's enabled (levers 2–3). If two of your *own* skills
overlap, split or merge them so each has a clean, non-colliding trigger.
