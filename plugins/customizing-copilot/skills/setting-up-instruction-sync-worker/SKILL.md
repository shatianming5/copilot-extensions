  Scaffold the `projection-reflect` deterministic sync worker for a repo that
  wants its enabled plugins' static instruction-projection content kept
  current automatically, instead of only at the next session's proactive
  resync. Requires the adopting repo's own explicit, committed opt-in before
  scaffolding the scheduler, bypass profile, or reconciler agent -- never
  merely an operator request in the current session. (The `.gitignore`
  local-cache convention is the one exception -- see its own section below.)
  Use when a repo asks to automate instruction-projection sync, add a
  scheduled projection-reflect worker, or enable a projection bypass profile
  for its review gate.
  Trigger phrases include:

# Setting Up the Instruction Sync Worker

Scaffolds `projection-reflect` (`efforts/2026/10/02
ambient-guidance-navigability` Phase 2) for a repo that wants its own scheduled, non-agentic worker to keep
enabled plugins' checked-in static instruction projections current, closing
the sync-freshness gap the immediate/proactive resync trigger
(`copilot-extensions-harness:cross-repo-debug-tracking`) only covers when a
session happens to be active.

This skill is a **scaffolder**, not a turnkey installer: the scheduler
mechanism (a systemd timer, a scheduled GitHub Action, a cron entry) and the
review-gate bypass mechanism (branch protection exceptions, a labeled-PR
auto-merge rule) are unavoidably repo-specific. What this skill provides is
generic across any adopting repo: the decision layer
(`projection_reflect.py`), the conflict-dispatch primitive
(`agent_dispatch.conflict_dispatch`), the reconciler agent template
(`projection-reconciler-agent-template.md`), and -- the piece unique to this
skill -- the **consent gate** that must guard all of the above, plus templates
for the two repo-specific pieces to adapt.

## The consent gate comes first -- always

**Never scaffold the reconciler agent, scheduler config, or bypass profile
without the adopting repo's explicit, committed, in-repo opt-in already
present.** (The `.gitignore` local-cache convention is the one exception --
see its own section below, which carries its own, different authority
requirement instead.) Per
[`docs/patterns/install-vs-adopt-boundary.md`](../../../../docs/patterns/install-vs-adopt-boundary.md):
granting a scheduler repo-write authority and a review-bypass profile is repo
mutation, not a machine-local install/update concern -- and "the operator
asked for it in this session" or "the repo is PR-gated" are **not**
ownership signals (a repo you only contribute to is often PR-gated too).

The ownership signal is a committed `.github/copilot/projection-reflect.json`
matching this schema (validated by the sibling
`reviewing-customizations` skill's
`scripts/projection_reflect_consent.py`'s `load_consent`):

```json
{
  "schema": "copilot-extensions.projection-reflect-consent",
  "version": 1,
  "enabled": true,
  "reconcilerAgent": "projection-reconciler",
  "dispatchLabel": "projection-conflict",
  "trustedMarketplaces": ["copilot-extensions"],
  "requireImmutablePin": false
}
```

`requireImmutablePin` is optional (defaults to `false` when absent). Most
adopters sync externally-installed marketplace plugins, which
`scan_plugin_sources.resolve_pinned_commits()` cannot pin at all today (only
a self-hosted/directory-marketplace source resolves a commit, via `git
rev-parse HEAD` inside its own payload root) -- setting this `true`
unconditionally would silently disable the bypass path entirely for that
common case. Only set it `true` once you understand that tradeoff (see
issue #3132 for the still-open externally-installed-source half of this
gap).

- **No file present, or `enabled` is not literally `true`:** decline to
  scaffold the reconciler agent, scheduler, or bypass profile. You may
  still report what drift exists (`scan --from-settings`) -- report-only
  mode never requires consent -- but never open an auto-mergeable PR or
  install a scheduler. (The `.gitignore` convention below is unaffected by
  this.)
- **A repo genuinely wants this:** its own maintainer commits this file
  through the repo's normal contribution flow (a PR, reviewed like any other
  change) *before* asking this skill to scaffold the reconciler, scheduler,
  or bypass profile. If the file is missing, walk the operator through
  authoring and landing it first -- do not write it yourself as a side
  effect of "setting up the worker."
- **Consent is rechecked live, not only at setup time.** Both the scheduled
  worker and the bypass profile call `load_consent` on every run/every PR --
  there is no cache. The moment the file is deleted, edited to
  `"enabled": false`, or otherwise fails validation, both the worker and the
  bypass fail closed on their very next run, without a second `setup`
  invocation. Withdrawing consent is exactly: edit or delete the file.

## The `.gitignore` convention -- not gated by this skill's consent file, but still a repo mutation

This scaffolding step is **not** gated by the `projection-reflect.json`
consent file above: `render_local_cache()` (Phase 7,
`docs/patterns/worktree-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`) is permissionless by
design -- a local, gitignored file write, no commit, no PR -- regardless of
whether a repo ever adopts the scheduler/bypass pieces this skill otherwise
scaffolds. So scaffolding this rule never needs that specific opt-in file
to exist first.

But committing a `.gitignore` rule is still an ordinary **repo mutation**,
not a machine-local concern -- per
[`docs/patterns/install-vs-adopt-boundary.md`](../../../../docs/patterns/install-vs-adopt-boundary.md):
repo-write authority comes from the repository's ownership and its own
contribution flow, never merely from an operator's in-session request. Only
propose this rule through that repo's normal PR flow, as you would any
other change to a repo you don't unilaterally own -- never commit it
directly as a side effect of an unrelated session. Keep the *render*
permissionless; gate the *ignore-rule commit* like any other repo change.

Scaffold, from
[`references/templates/gitignore-rule.md`](references/templates/gitignore-rule.md):
`**/*.local.instructions.md` under `.github/instructions/` (a dedicated
`.github/instructions/.gitignore`, or an equivalent repo-root recursive
rule). This rule does not make the orphan scan's git-tracked check work --
`git ls-files` already excludes every untracked file regardless of ignore
matching, so a freshly rendered, unignored local-cache file is still
excluded correctly without it. What the rule actually prevents is a later
`git add -A` (or an editor's "stage all") turning that file into a *tracked*
one by accident -- and only a tracked file is no longer excluded from the
checked-in orphan scan
(`instruction_projections._iter_projection_files`), where it is instead
caught and reported as `projection-orphan-file` rather than hidden. Add the
rule to close off that accidental-staging path up front, not because the
scan depends on it.

## What to scaffold, once consent is present

1. **A `projection-reconciler` agent** for the adopting repo, from
   [`projection-reconciler-agent-template.md`](../reviewing-customizations/references/projection-reconciler-agent-template.md).
   Copy it to that repo's `.github/agents/projection-reconciler.agent.md`,
   filling in its own PR-review/merge tooling reference (per the template's
   own "Adapting this template" section) and wiring any MCP servers its own
   review flow needs -- the template ships with none, since PR/issue tooling
   is repo-specific.

2. **A scheduler config**, adapted from
   [`references/templates/scheduler-config.md`](references/templates/scheduler-config.md)
   to whichever mechanism the repo already uses for scheduled automation
   (a systemd timer, a scheduled Action, cron). It must: call
   `load_consent` first and exit immediately (no PR, no scheduler action) if
   it returns `None`; refresh enabled plugin payloads; then call
   `projection_sync_worker.run_sync_pass()` -- never hand-roll the
   sync/scan/decide sequence separately, which risks dropping a lock-only
   change, a sync-side failure, or a race between two workers, exactly the
   failure modes `run_sync_pass` exists to close. When
   `outcome.bypass_eligible`, open or update the stamp-labeled PR. When not
   eligible, distinguish *why*: only `outcome.needs_conflict_dispatch` (a
   real conflict-classified finding) is dispatched to the reconciler via
   `agent_dispatch.conflict_dispatch.build_dispatch`, naming the consent
   file's own `reconcilerAgent`/`dispatchLabel` -- an otherwise-clean change
   from an untrusted source alone stays review-only and is never dispatched
   to an agent (the reconciler is only authorized to resolve real
   conflicts).

3. **A bypass-config profile**, adapted from
   [`references/templates/bypass-profile.md`](references/templates/bypass-profile.md)
   for whichever review gate the repo already uses. It must re-check
   `load_consent` on every PR (not cache a prior check), and restrict itself
   to: the stamp label present, every changed path inside
   `.github/instructions/**` and the lock file, a diff shape of regular-file
   adds/modifies only, a byte-exact recompute match, and every changed
   source's marketplace inside the consent file's own
   `trustedMarketplaces` -- the same conjunction `projection_reflect.py`'s
   `bypass_decision` already proves, never identity alone.

4. **Reuse the repo's existing trusted deterministic identity** for this
   reflect kind, per the Plan's own requirement -- never mint a new one as a
   side effect of this skill. If the repo has no existing reflect-style
   identity, this skill must **decline outright** (report-only mode still
   available) until that identity is provisioned and registered through the
   repo's own normal, reviewed account/credential process -- or walk the
   operator through that one-time registration explicitly. Never do it as an
   automatic side effect of "set up the instruction sync worker."

## Validation before calling it done

- A negative-proof check: with no opt-in file present, confirm the worker
  refuses to scaffold (see `test_projection_reflect_consent.py`'s own
  no-file/`enabled: false` cases for the pattern to replicate against the
  live scheduler/bypass code once built).
- A live-revocation check: opt-in present at setup, then removed -- confirm
  both the worker and the bypass fail closed on their very next run without
  a second `setup` call.
- Re-run `customizing-copilot`'s own test suite
  (`tools/run-plugin-tests.py customizing-copilot`) and this repo's
  `check-version-bump`/`check-version-consistency`/`check-docs-consistency`.
