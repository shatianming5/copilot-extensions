  already reverse-import (the __main__.py "_core()"/monkeypatch-safe
  cross-call idiom), extracting a module safely with tests intact, landing on
  a fast-moving base branch, refreshing the shrink-only module-size baseline,

  prioritize which already-grandfathered files to tackle first.
  Trigger phrases include:

# Componentizing Modules

A runbook for breaking a large or growing source/test file into smaller,
single-responsibility pieces. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s Componentization bullet
for the policy (1,000-line hard cap, shrink-only baseline, "a couple of
related classes/functions per module" as the working ceiling); this skill is
the *how*.

## When to use this

- A module you're already editing is approaching, at, or past its cap/ceiling
  (`python tools/check-module-size.py`).
- You're picking the next item off a componentization backlog and want the
  current worst offenders (`python tools/rank-module-size.py`).
- A test module has grown into a runner covering several unrelated behavioral
  contracts.
- **Proactively**: you're adding a new responsibility to a module that already
  has one or two unrelated ones, even if it's nowhere near the cap yet. Don't
  wait for the guard to fail — by the time it fails, the responsibilities are
  usually already entangled.

## Step 1 — find the seams, not just a line to cut at

A module rarely needs a syntactic mid-point split; it needs its distinct
responsibilities pulled apart. Look for:

- **A CLI/route/handler registration table.** If the module is a `__main__.py`
  (or any dispatcher wiring subcommands, routes, or event handlers to
  implementations), each subcommand/route family is almost always independent
  of the others and only shares a thin registration surface. Extract each
  family into its own module (`<verb>_cli.py`, `<area>_routes.py`, …) and leave
  behind a thin registrar that imports and wires them — this is exactly what
  `agent-dispatch` did extracting `producers_cli.py`, `recipes_cli.py`, and
  `supervise_cli.py` out of its `__main__.py`; read that extraction as a
  worked example before inventing a new shape.
- **A policy table vs. its evaluator.** Static data (allowed transitions,
  effect matrices, default configs) belongs in its own module separate from
  the code that interprets it.
- **An adapter per external system/shell.** Code branching heavily on
  "which backend/shell/platform" is a sign each branch wants its own adapter
  module behind a shared interface.
- **A single large class with many methods, all sharing instance state
  (a connection, a lock, a cache).** Free-function extraction doesn't fit
  here — the methods need `self`. Split via **mixin classes** instead: group
  methods by responsibility into `_XMixin` classes in separate files, then
  compose them back with `class Foo(_AMixin, _BMixin, ...): ...` in the
  original module. This is safe without call-graph tracing because
  `self.<method>()` resolves through the instance's MRO at runtime
  regardless of which mixin file defines it — unlike splitting a CLI's
  free functions, you don't need to prove which module each caller should
  import from. Keep `__init__` (and any other state-establishing method) in
  whichever mixin comes first in the base-class list. `agent-bridge`'s
  `db.py` (one `Database` class, ~75 methods) split into `db_core.py`,
  `db_schema.py`, `db_sessions.py`, `db_live_sessions.py`, `db_events.py`,
  `db_prompts.py`, and `db_maintenance.py` this way — read that split as the
  worked example.
- **A vendored/synced copy.** Before splitting a file, check whether it's one
  of several *identical* copies kept in sync by a tool like
  `tools/sync-installation-context.py`, `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py`, or
  `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py`. If so, split the **canonical** source
  (see that tool's `CANONICAL_DIR`/`_lib_copies()`), not a downstream copy —
  the sync step propagates the split to every adopter automatically.
- **A framework app-factory with routes/handlers closing over local state**
  (e.g. a FastAPI `create_app()` building routes inline that close over
  `queue`, `bus`, or similar locals). This is the hardest shape — neither
  free-function extraction nor mixins apply cleanly, since each route needs
  that closed-over state. Don't rush it: design an explicit way to carry the
  state across the split first (e.g. an `APIRouter` factory function taking
  the state as constructor arguments), and treat it as its own dedicated
  slice rather than reusing another shape's mechanics by rote.

This same seam-finding logic applies to `.sh`, `.ps1`, and `.ts` sources, even
though the automated cap currently only scans `*.py` (see CONTRIBUTING.md) —
don't let that tooling gap be an excuse to let a large shell/PowerShell/
TypeScript file keep growing unsplit.

- **A compatibility root many siblings already call back into.** A large
  `__main__.py` (or any module several sibling `*_cli.py`/`*_runtime.py`
  files already reverse-import via `from . import __main__ as core`) is a
  DIFFERENT shape from a plain CLI registration table: the functions you
  want to move are frequently called *both* externally (other modules,
  already going through `core()`) *and* internally (by sibling functions in
  the same band you're about to move, currently calling each other by bare
  name since they're all still in one file). See **"Splitting a
  compatibility root"** below before starting this shape — naive extraction
  silently breaks monkeypatch-based test compatibility in a way `ruff`/a
  partial test run will not catch.

## Step 2 — extract

1. Create the new module(s) with only the moved code plus the imports it
   actually needs; do not drag along unrelated helpers "just in case".
2. Update the original module to import from the new location. Keep a
   re-export only if external callers depend on the old import path and
   updating every caller isn't part of this change; otherwise update callers
   directly and skip the indirection.
3. Keep the diff mechanical wherever possible (move + import fixups) —
   behavior changes belong in a separate commit/PR from a pure split, so a
   reviewer (or a future bisect) can tell "moved" from "changed" at a glance.
4. **Check every method/function you moved for decorators that don't show up
   in a plain `^def ` grep** — `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, `@property`,
   `@cached_property`, and similar sit on the line(s) *above* the
   `def`/`async def` and are trivially dropped when moving code by hand or
   copy-paste. A dropped `@staticmethod` in particular fails loudly (a
   `TypeError: takes N positional arguments but N+1 were given`) but only
   when something actually calls it through `self.` — which a partial test
   run can miss (see Step 3). Grep the *original* file for
   `@staticmethod|@classmethod|@property|@cached_property` before you start
   and confirm every one of those decorated definitions still carries its
   decorator in its new home.

## Splitting a compatibility root

**Design invariant: new code should migrate *off* this idiom, not perpetuate
it.** A `core()`/`_core()` accessor is a trap, not a shortcut — every future
split has to keep preserving it to stay monkeypatch-safe instead of actually
decoupling anything. See
`docs/patterns/compatibility-root-decoupling.md` for the full rationale and
the incremental (one-name-at-a-time) migration approach, and
`efforts/active/` for the dedicated tracking effort. The rest of this section
is the safe way to work *with* an existing, not-yet-decoupled root while
that migration is in progress — not a recommendation to introduce a new one.

A big `__main__.py`-shaped module usually already has this idiom in play:
sibling modules define `def _core(): from . import __main__ as core; return
core`, then call `core.<name>(...)` for anything still living in the root —
this is how `resolve_launch_cli.py`, `worktree_creation.py`, and
`handoff_cutover.py` all call back into `agent-worktrees/__main__.py`. When
you extract a new band OUT of that same root, two things you'd otherwise
miss both stem from the same cause: tests monkeypatch functions **directly on
the root module object** (`monkeypatch.setattr(m, "_some_func", fake)`,
where `m` is the imported root module), and that monkeypatch must still be
observed no matter which file's code path actually calls `_some_func` next.

- **Every cross-call between functions in the band you're moving — and every
  call out to a helper that stays resident in the root — must go through
  `core()` (or an equivalent `_core()`/`_self_override()` accessor), never a
  bare local name.** A bare name resolves through the *new* module's own
  globals at call time, silently ignoring a monkeypatch applied to the root.
  This is easy to get wrong exactly where it matters least visibly: a
  function you moved calling ANOTHER function you moved in the same PR, with
  no immediately obvious external caller — grep the test suite for
  `monkeypatch.setattr(m, "<name>"` (or your project's equivalent alias) for
  every name in the band before assuming a bare call is safe. This is *not*
  only about functions: it applies identically to **module-level constants**
  a test overrides (e.g. a retry-count/delay tunable) — moving the constant's
  *definition* to the new module without routing every read through `core()`
  means a test's `monkeypatch.setattr(m, "_RETRY_COUNT", 1)` silently stops
  affecting the code that reads it.
- **Compatibility re-exports aren't only about functions.** Before removing
  an import that looks unused in the root after your move, check whether a
  test accesses it directly as an attribute on the root
  (`monkeypatch.setattr(m.<module>, ...)`, `m.<constant>`, `m.<ClassName>`) —
  a shared module object, a constant, or a class can all be part of the
  compatibility surface just as much as a function, and `ruff`'s "unused
  import" signal has no visibility into a test file's attribute access.
- **A source-string regression test needs updating, not just re-exporting.**
  Some regression tests assert a literal code string is present in a
  specific file's own text (a `Path(...).read_text()` + `assert '...' in
  src` guard, usually protecting against a specific historical bug
  reintroducing itself) rather than exercising behavior through a
  monkeypatch. If the literal moved with your split, point that test's file
  path at the new module — the guard's *intent* survives the move, but the
  test itself does not update automatically the way a monkeypatch-based test
  does.
- Once the split lands, the pattern is self-reinforcing: the next person
  extracting yet another band from the same root inherits the same
  `core()`-everywhere discipline already visible in every sibling file.

## Landing on a fast-moving base branch

If the target repo has an active promote/release automation (a bot
periodically fast-forwarding one branch from another, or squash-promoting a
`dev` branch to `main` on a schedule), a componentization PR's base can move
out from under it mid-review — expect this, don't treat it as an anomaly:

- **Refresh onto the current base right before your final push, not just
  once at the start — and prefer cherry-pick over a full rebase as the
  mechanism.** A `git rebase origin/<base>` that replays many unrelated
  intervening commits is slow and conflict-prone when the branches have
  diverged far (version bump files, shared changelogs, and any other file
  BOTH branches touch for unrelated reasons all become potential conflicts
  on every intervening commit). Prefer resetting your branch onto the
  current tip and cherry-picking your own commit(s) back on top instead:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin <base>                       # get the CURRENT tip, not a stale tracking ref
  git branch backup-$(git rev-parse HEAD) HEAD   # cheap safety net before any reset
  git checkout -B <branch> origin/<base>         # move the branch pointer, don't just merge
  git cherry-pick <your commit(s)>               # replay only your actual change
  ```

  This replays only your actual change against the current tip, not the full
  commit-by-commit history between your old base and the new one. Always
  `fetch` immediately before the `checkout -B` — resetting onto a stale local
  `origin/<base>` silently defeats the entire point. The backup branch costs
  nothing and means a botched cherry-pick/reset is trivially recoverable
  (`git checkout -B <branch> backup-<sha>` undoes it).
- **Re-run `--refresh-baseline` (or your project's equivalent generated-file
  refresh) against the POST-rebase tree, every time, not the value you
  computed before rebasing.** A baseline/lockfile snapshot taken before a
  rebase reflects a base that no longer exists; carrying it forward
  reintroduces exactly the drift the refresh exists to catch, sometimes in
  the opposite direction (a ceiling that's now *too low* for the merged
  tree, failing the guard on unrelated files).
- **Don't pin an exact line count in a PR description or journal entry if the
  base branch is still moving.** State the source of truth instead ("run
  `check-module-size.py` against the checked-in files") — a pinned number is
  guaranteed to go stale by the time of merge and invites a review round
  trip over a non-issue.
- **A polite, single self-merge window beats waiting indefinitely on an
  advisory-only automated review.** If the repo's contribution policy names
  automated review as non-blocking (check its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` before
  assuming otherwise — the wait/nudge/self-merge policy is project-specific
  and does not generalize), give it its stated window, address anything it
  actually found, and merge — don't leave a mergeable, checks-green PR idle
  waiting for a verdict the policy already says isn't required.

## Step 3 — re-validate

```bash
python tools/run-plugin-tests.py <plugin>        # the plugin(s) you touched
ruff check --select F,E9 <every file you touched or created>
python tools/check-module-size.py                # must still pass
```

Prefer `python tools/run_tests_in_devcontainer.py <plugin>` over the first
line above when Docker + the devcontainers CLI are available (Linux only;
`git add` any newly created files first — see `AGENTS.md` § *Test Before PR
Publication*).

**`run-plugin-tests.py` groups a plugin's tests into sub-suites and stops at
the first sub-suite that fails** — including a pre-existing, unrelated
failure already in sub-suite 1 that has nothing to do with your change. A
green run only proves sub-suite 1 passed; it does **not** prove your change
is safe if an earlier, unrelated failure means later sub-suites (2, 3, ...)
never ran at all. This masked a real regression during this effort's own
`db.py` mixin split (a dropped `@staticmethod`, see Step 2) until CI's
differently-shaped run surfaced it. Do not trust a local run that stops at
sub-suite 1 as full coverage of your change:
- If the plugin has **any** pre-existing failure, target the actual
  files/behavior you changed directly, e.g.
  `python tools/run-plugin-tests.py <plugin> -k "<area you touched>"`,
  and confirm that filtered run is fully green (it bypasses sub-suite
  grouping and reaches every matching test regardless of unrelated
  failures elsewhere).
- Compare the *total counts* (`N passed, M failed, K skipped`) your run
  reports against what you expect for the whole suite, not just "did it
  print PASS" — a truncated early-exit run reports a smaller, misleadingly
  clean-looking number.
- CI is the authoritative, full-matrix confirmation — treat a passing CI
  run (with only already-known, unrelated pre-existing failures) as the
  real gate before merging, not a substitute for your own targeted check.

If a **baselined** file shrunk below its prior grandfathered ceiling:

```bash
python tools/check-module-size.py --refresh-baseline
```

This only ever *lowers or removes* entries — never raises one — so it's safe
to run any time after a shrink. Commit the updated
`tools/module-size-baseline.json` alongside the split.

If you extracted from a vendored-sync canonical source, also run that source's
sync check (e.g. `python tools/sync-installation-context.py --check`) and
`python tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` before pushing.

## Splitting a large test module

Follow `TESTING.md`'s directive: split by **behavioral contract**, not
arbitrary line count. Prefer one parameterized/scenario-style test per
contract over many near-duplicate process-launching micro-tests. As you split:

- Tag each resulting test (or class) with
  `@pytest.mark.contract("<component>.<behavior>")` naming the contract it
  covers. This is attribution, not enforced policy — its job is to make a
  test's contract a filterable, greppable fact (`pytest -m 'contract("...")'`)
  instead of something only inferable from the file it happens to live in, so
  a *future* re-split can prove no contract's coverage silently moved or
  disappeared.
- Keep the existing `portfolio_tier`/`effect` markers as-is; `contract` is
  additive attribution alongside them, not a replacement.

## Prioritizing what to split next

```bash
python tools/rank-module-size.py                 # biggest offenders overall
python tools/rank-module-size.py --near-cap 25   # closest to failing next
```

The ranking folds identical vendored copies into their canonical source (see
Step 1) so it reflects distinct real work, not duplicated line counts. Treat
the top of that list — and anything with a small `--near-cap` margin — as the
standing backlog; see the `module-componentization-discipline` effort for the
current prioritized phasing.
