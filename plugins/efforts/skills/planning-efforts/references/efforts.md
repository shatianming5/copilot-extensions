# Efforts — Reference Guide

The canonical reference for the **efforts planning system**. This guide ships
as an asset of the `planning-efforts` skill; the skill is the how-to workflow,
this guide is the *why* and the full schema. An adopting repo specializes the
system through a short **addendum** (see *Adoption & the addendum* below) — it
does not fork this guide.

## What an effort is (and isn't)

An **effort** is a comprehensive planning folder representing a *stretch of
work*: its premise, evolving plan, validation plan, running journal, and the
coordination surface for the participants doing the work. One effort, one
folder, one README that humans and agents both read and write.

The name is deliberately **not** `feature`, `bug`, or `task` — those nouns are
owned by issue trackers (GitHub, Gitea, Azure DevOps). An effort is the
planning workspace *around* tracked work; it spawns and references issues and
outlives any single one.

| Construct | Question it answers | Tense | Home |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|------|
| **Effort** | "What are we doing, and how's it going?" | plan + progress | `efforts/` |
| **Doc** | "How does this actually work?" | *is* (truth) | docs |
| **Issue** | "What discrete thing needs doing?" | *to do* | the tracker |

> A doc describing the efforts *system* (like this guide) is truthful "what is"
> documentation. An effort is the temporary plan and coordination record for a
> stretch of work. Don't conflate the two: when an effort establishes durable
> truth about how something works, promote that into a doc — the archived effort
> is a record, not living docs.

### Efforts and issues go hand in hand

An effort typically opens with an **umbrella issue** and breaks down into
**sub-issues**; the README cross-links them. The binding rule:

> **Only issues filed for *this* repo may directly reference effort files in
> this repo.** A cross-repo issue (or mirror) references the *tracked work*,
> not a path it cannot resolve.

## Layout

├── README.md              # the repo's effort index + the local addendum
├── TEMPLATE.md            # the effort README schema (copy when starting one)

└── <YYYY>/...             # archived efforts, dated by completion
```

- **Slug:** kebab-case, descriptive.
- **Decompose liberally.** The `README.md` is loaded whole every time an agent
  resumes the effort, so keep it a navigable map. When a phase or slice grows a
  large self-contained body (detailed sub-plan, deep design notes, its own
  validation matrix), extract it to a sibling sub-doc
  (`<effort-folder>/<phase>.md`) and
  leave the Plan a checklist item with a one-line summary and a link. The agent
  reads a sub-doc only when working that phase — upfront context stays small, at
  the cost of an extra read on demand. Link out *and* back; no orphan sub-docs.
- **Split a large journal by date.** The Journal is append-only, so it is the
  one section that grows without bound. When it (as an inline README section or
  an extracted `journal.md`) approaches the ~800-line soft cap, break it into
  dated files: `<effort-folder>/journal/<YYYY>/MM.DD <title>.md`, one per day
  (or per notable entry), mirroring the archive's date scheme. Leave
  `journal.md` (or the README Journal section) as a **thin chronological index**
  that links each dated file newest-first — so a resuming agent skims the index
  and opens only the day it needs. Link out *and* back; no orphan entries.
- **Grouping (a binding — set by the addendum):**
  - *flat* — `efforts/active/<slug>/` (default; for a repo that is itself the
    primary unit of work).
  - *by-repo* — `efforts/active/<repo>/<slug>/` (for a coordination repo that
    spans many target repos).
- **Archive (a binding — set by the addendum):** dated by when the effort
  closed, e.g. `efforts/<YYYY>/MM/DD <slug>/` (flat) or
  `efforts/<YYYY>/<repo>/MM/DD <slug>/` (by-repo). The archive is a
  chronological record, not a status bucket.

## The effort README — schema

`TEMPLATE.md` is the canonical template. The README is a **shared contract**:
the host agent, any dispatched agents, and the operator all read and write the
same file. It — not the conversation transcript — is the source of truth.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Header** | slug, repo, branch(es), created date, status, umbrella + sub-issues |
| **Guiding Intent** | the north star — what success looks like, why it matters |
| **Participants** | who/what does the work (the executor seam — see below) |
| **Coordination** | optional; multi-agent branch topology + host/delegate roles + PR ownership (the *branches* binding) |
| **Context** | background, source issue/plan/idea, prior decisions, references |
| **Request** | the operator's ask, captured verbatim |
| **Plan** | phased implementation plan with checklists |
| **Validation Plan** | how we'll know it works (efforts are validation-driven) |
| **Proposal** | optional detailed findings once the plan firms up |
| **Journal** | dated, append-only log of what actually happened |

An addendum may rename sections (e.g. **Participants** → **Machines**), add
repo-specific sections, or omit optional sections such as **Coordination** or
**Proposal**. The header, Guiding Intent, Request, Plan, Validation Plan, and
Journal are the irreducible core. **Participants** is the canonical executor
seam, but a single local effort may omit it.

### Validation-driven

Every effort should carry **both** an implementation plan and a
validation/test plan. An effort may legitimately *start* as nothing but a
reproduction — a failing validation captured first, with the fix to follow. The
endgame is test-driven work across whatever participants the effort
coordinates: validate against the real target, feed failures back to whoever
(or whatever) is implementing, and loop until the validation passes.

### Additive and subtractive efforts

An effort is carved from a **delta** — a gap between a requested/desired outcome
and current reality. Most deltas are **additive** (a required capability is
missing → build it), but a delta can equally be **subtractive** (a capability
should *no longer* exist → remove it). The two are not symmetric, and the
distinction is a safety property:

- A **subtractive / removal effort** must trace to an **explicit removal intent**
  — a stated decision to decommission the capability (e.g. a "no X" boundary in a
  north-star source, a deprecation call, an operator directive). It must **never**
  be justified by the *mere absence* of a mention in some source document:
  silence is latitude, not a removal order.
- Its **Validation Plan** proves two things: the capability is genuinely **gone**,
  *and* nothing that depended on it broke — callers, docs, configs, and
  downstream consumers are reconciled. Removal is destructive; the validation is
  what makes it safe.

(Where the delta is sourced from a **vision**, the mapping of positive vs.
negative vision statements to additive vs. subtractive deltas is governed by the
visions system — the effort just consumes the delta it is handed.)

## The participants seam

The `## Participants` section is the **pluggable seam** that makes efforts
reusable. It catalogs *who or what does the dispatched work*, and each adopting
repo binds it to its own executor provider:

| Binding | Participant | Reached via |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| machine fleet | a workstation / server | SSH alias, agent-bridge |
| CodeSpaces | a GitHub CodeSpace | `agent-codespaces` |
| containers | a local dev container | `agent-containers` |
| branches | a shared feature branch several agents build on | git; in an agent-worktrees repo, the **`agent-worktrees:git-collaboration`** skill provides turn-key `git sync` / `feature-branch` / `merge-to-feature` helpers; delegates may be dispatched via **agent-bridge** |

When the binding is **branches**, the effort README's `## Coordination` section
holds the topology: a **shared feature branch** (delegates ff-push slices; the
**host** owns PRs) for interdependent work, or **independent worktrees with
per-slice PRs** when each PR leaves the default branch green on its own. In an
a repo managed by agent-worktrees, the mechanics are turn-key helpers in the
`agent-worktrees:git-collaboration` skill -- the effort records only the plan and who owns what.

The effort README is where multi-participant coordination is planned and
journaled, so a fresh agent can pick up the effort from the file alone. Keep
everything else in the schema **executor-neutral** — participant specifics
belong in this section and in the repo's addendum, nowhere else. That
separation is what lets one plugin serve many repos and many executor plugins.

## Lifecycle

1. **Start** — point at an existing issue, plan, roadmap, or idea. Derive a
   kebab-case slug, copy the repo's `efforts/TEMPLATE.md` to the grouped active
   effort path (for example, `efforts/active/<slug>/README.md`), and capture the
   **Request** verbatim plus the **Guiding Intent**. Open an umbrella issue if
   the work warrants tracking, and cross-link it.
2. **Plan** — fill in Context, Plan, and Validation Plan. File sub-issues for
   discrete tracked work and link them. Once the README declares the exact
   participant table label and Plan heading, a managed worktree may bind with
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus bind <repo-relative README>
   --participant <declared> --slice <declared>`. A missing command/untracked
   worktree degrades to the standalone lifecycle. A validation refusal means the
   declaration is absent or mismatched: correct the real plan or remain unbound;
   never invent a declaration or hand-edit the record.
3. **Review gate** — before executing, route the *plan* through review. After the
   operator's own review rounds, **if the control repo offers automated PR
   review**, submit the effort as a PR (with auto-merge), let it be approved +
   merged, then **pull the worktree forward onto the merged plan** (the
   repo's normal pull-forward command; in an agent-worktrees repo this is the
   `agent-worktrees:git-collaboration` skill's `git sync` helper) and execute on top. The operator
   may waive their own review; the agent's gate is non-optional when automated
   review exists. It guarantees a reviewed plan, makes the effort visible to other
   agents (dedupe / co-work), and leaves a crash-recovery point. Where no
   automated review exists, the gate collapses to "commit the plan, then execute."
4. **Execute** — do the work on a working branch; keep the **Journal** current.
   Record participant dispatches, decisions, and blockers. The README stays
   ahead of the conversation, but **batch effort edits** (each upstream edit costs
   a PR) to direction changes, phase boundaries, or commits that need pushing
   anyway. By **code-complete**, the README reflects the done state and names the
   *next* carry-forward effort; record **merged** PRs only (never the in-flight
   one the current commit is opening). For **cross-repo / tracking-only** efforts,
   propose-before-you-do: PR the not-yet-done plan first, make the external
   changes after it clears, then report completion as a separate delta.
   A resumed managed worktree first inspects
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus show --json` and binds its
   declared slice if necessary. An open binding derives the existing
   worktree `follow_up` cleanup gate and effort summary; it is not a second
   responsibility flag. Context handoff while bound links the effort README and
   carries only the immediate next slice, in-flight work, blockers/decisions,
   and required confirmations; it does not copy the Request, Plan, Validation
   Plan, or Journal. A successor reads the effort first and consults predecessor
   history only when the relay delta is insufficient.
5. **Archive and release** — resolve every Plan and Validation Plan item. A
   transferred item uses the machine-checked form
   `- [x] Deferred to \`<tracked objective>\`: <original item>` or
   `- [x] Blocked; transferred to \`<tracked objective>\`: <original item>`.
   Then set
   **Status: Done**, move the active folder to the addendum's standard flat or
   by-repo dated archive path, write a closing Journal entry, update the active
   index, promote durable truth, and land that archive change through the repo's
   review/merge gate. Then release the still-bound managed worktree with
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus release --completed`; silent
   release is refused and the command verifies `Status: Done` plus every
   resolved Plan/Validation Plan checkbox at either the active or standard dated
   archive path. If responsibility moves instead, use
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus release --transfer "<tracked
   objective>"`.

### Worktree-local active focus

`active_effort` is an optional structured value owned by the worktree record:
repository-relative README path, declared participant, and declared slice. It
is independently validated against the authoritative worktree checkout, so two
worktrees in one repository can bind different efforts without collision.
Several worktrees may bind one effort only through distinct declared slices;
participants identify actors but do not make duplicate slice ownership safe.
A canonical effort outside the current repository remains standalone unless a
declared local sub-effort exists. A missing runtime, malformed/stale pointer, completed
effort, or unavailable checkout simply omits dynamic orientation; it never
blocks session startup.

The existing agent-worktrees session-conduct owner adds only a bounded pointer
to its record-first history digest. It does not embed the effort, duplicate
handoff state, or create another `sessionStart` producer.

## Cross-repo placement

An effort frequently touches a repo other than the one it lives in. Before
placing any effort in the target, resolve an authoritative local checkout or
worktree through the target's owning repository tool. Resolve the efforts plugin
root by walking two parents up from the loaded `planning-efforts` skill base,
then run the platform-native read-only capability probe:

```bash
bash <efforts-plugin-root>/scripts/emit-policy.sh --check-adoption <absolute-target-path>
```

```powershell
& <efforts-plugin-root>\scripts\emit-policy.ps1 -CheckAdoption <absolute-target-path>
```

Only exact JSON
`{"version":1,"capability":"efforts","adopted":true}` proves compatible
adoption. `{}`, malformed output, an absent checkout, or a remote-only target
means capability is unproven and orchestration stays in the host. The probe
resolves the Git root and reads the bounded adoption JSON without executing
target code or trusting a repository name.

With that decision made, there are **three placement models**:

1. **Local / tracking-only (default).** The effort folder lives in the control
   repo and *coordinates* work that lands in one or more target repos. The folder
   tracks; the real changes happen elsewhere. This is the right model when the
   stretch spans several targets, or the target has not adopted `efforts/`. The
   binding rule still holds — **only same-repo issues may link the effort's
   paths** — so a cross-repo issue references the *tracked work*, not a path it
   can't resolve.

2. **Build directly in the target repo.** When the exact probe reports
   compatible adoption and the stretch is genuinely *about that repo*, author
   one canonical target-owned effort **in the target**, through that repo's own
   flow (grouping, tracker, review gate, addendum). The host retains its private
   orchestration context and a one-way reference to the target effort. The
   target effort never points back into host-private state.

3. **Hybrid (split public/private).** Keep a **generalized** effort in a
   **public / portable** repo and a **fuller, downstream-private** effort in the
   control repo that **links to it**. This buys portability *and* private depth
   without leaking. The load-bearing rule that keeps it from becoming two sources
   of truth: **the public generalized effort is canonical** — it is what other
   agents cite, and the version the plan is reviewed as — while the private effort
   *elaborates* it (private names, hosts, downstream wiring) and **links back**.
   Keep the public artifact **generic**, per the repo's public-artifact rule; put
   anything downstream-private only in the private effort.

**Several hosts, one compatible target:** the first host creates or claims the
target-local effort through the target's normal public coordination flow.
Later hosts discover and reference that same effort while retaining only their
own host orchestration context. The target effort is canonical for target-local
scope. Do not create cyclic references, reciprocal ownership, drifting peer
copies, or multiple target-local efforts for the same objective. A malformed
target config, including unknown keys or a value that attempts to weaken
required enforcement, is not adoption and cannot change plugin-owned policy.

**Ordering (all three models):** *propose before you do* — PR the not-yet-done
plan, let it clear review, make the external changes, then report completion as a
separate status-only delta. When the effort lives in a **review-gated** repo and
also drives a **directly-pushed** target, the reviewed intent (the effort/plan
PR) lands **before** the unreviewed change that realizes it.

## Keep internal specifics out of a public-facing effort

An effort's Journal is a natural place to record *how* a decision was reached
— what was investigated, what broke, what the fix was. When the effort's own
repo is **public or externally-shareable**, that narrative can't carry the
same level of concrete detail a private knowledge repo's effort would — this
holds regardless of any private relationship between that repo and the
systems being discussed; what matters is that the repo itself is public. A
real **private/internal** repo or system name, a **private** cross-organization
issue reference, device or account naming conventions, or a blow-by-blow
internal-investigation narrative is exactly the kind of content that leaks
when it's committed to a public tree, even inside an effort folder that
otherwise looks like ordinary engineering notes. This is **not** a rule
against cross-repo references in general — a fully-qualified reference to a
genuinely public repo (upstream, downstream, a public dependency) is
legitimate traceability and belongs in the Journal exactly as this guide's own
*Cross-repo placement* and the skill's *Issues and sources* sections already
expect; narrow the caution to references that would themselves reveal a
private repo, system, or organization's existence or internals.

- **Abstract, don't omit.** The *decision* and its *rationale* are still
  worth capturing — generalize the specifics instead of deleting the entry.
  "Investigated whether a dependent service could host X directly; confirmed
  it couldn't without upstream changes, so built the control layer here
  instead" preserves the lesson without naming the dependent service,
  quoting its internal issue number, or walking through its source.
- **Route the un-abstracted record to where it belongs.** If a precise,
  unabstracted account is genuinely useful to keep somewhere, that record
  belongs in a private knowledge repo (per that repo's own conventions), not
  in the public effort — note generically, in prose, that a fuller private
  record exists ("see the private incident record") rather than reproducing
  it **or linking to it**: the one-way linking rule above (private links to
  the canonical public effort, never the reverse) applies here too, and even
  a "generic" resolvable link can expose the private repo's existence or
  location to a public reader.
- **This isn't unique to Journal entries.** The same bar applies to Context,
  Request capture, and any sub-doc the effort links out to — anywhere an
  agent might be tempted to paste a real cross-repo reference, an internal
  codename, or incident specifics because that's what actually happened.
- **Redaction is the one safety exception to verbatim capture** (Request, and
  the `inception-transcript.md` sidecar) — but a name swap alone is not
  always enough. Capture everything else verbatim and generalize only the
  private part: replace the identifier with a generic placeholder *and*, if
  the surrounding sentence would still describe the private system's
  specific internals even with the name removed (its architecture, a
  specific mechanism it lacks, an implementation detail), generalize that
  narrative too using the same *abstract, don't omit* technique above —
  never drop, paraphrase, or soften the surrounding *intent* to work around
  it, only the private specifics that intent doesn't depend on. A verbatim
  exchange that necessarily contains such content is captured in full in a
  private knowledge repo's own sidecar instead of the public repo's
  `inception-transcript.md`, with the public README noting generically (in
  prose, no link) that a fuller private record exists elsewhere.
- **When in doubt, treat the repo's own leak-guard conventions as the
  bar**, if the repo has one (an identifier denylist, a scrub tool, a
  stated acceptance boundary) — abstract anything that convention would
  flag, not just what you personally recognize as sensitive.

## Adoption & the addendum

The `planning-efforts` skill governs the canonical pattern above. An adopting
repo writes a short **addendum** that specializes only the bindings:

- **Grouping** — flat or by-repo.
- **Archive layout** — the dated path pattern.
- **Participants binding** — the concrete label and how participants are
  reached (machines via SSH, CodeSpaces, containers, branches).
- **Section additions/renames** — any deltas to the README schema.
- **Repo-local rules** — e.g. which tracker holds issues, where sources of new
  efforts live (a `plans/`, `ROADMAP`, or backlog).

The addendum lives **in the adopting repo** — typically a `## Local
conventions` section of its `efforts/README.md`, or a dedicated binding doc
(e.g. `docs/efforts.md`) that `efforts/README.md` links to. The
`efforts-setup` skill scaffolds the `efforts/` tree and the addendum.

> Keep the addendum small. If you find yourself re-explaining the core pattern,
> it belongs in this guide, not the addendum. The addendum is deltas only.

## For executor plugins

An executor plugin (e.g. `agent-codespaces`, `agent-containers`) can integrate by
**owning the participants seam** for repos that adopt it. The efforts plugin does
not require those plugins; when present, they provide the concrete binding:

- Provide the concrete participant binding the addendum points at (how a
  CodeSpace / container is named, created, reached, and torn down).
- When the executor manages leases/claims, provide the commands or skills that
  commission and reclaim participants, and journal those transitions in the
  effort README.
- Leave the planning document and lifecycle to the efforts plugin — do not
  embed planning structure in the executor.
