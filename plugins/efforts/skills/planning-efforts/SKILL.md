# Planning Efforts

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
state-root and worktree operations below. Replace
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with the raw path and quote it at each
shell call site on POSIX; in PowerShell invoke it as
`& "<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>" <args>`.

An **effort** is a planning folder under `efforts/` representing a stretch of
work. It is the workspace *around* tracked work — deliberately not named
feature/bug/task (those belong to issue trackers). The effort README is a
**shared contract** read and written by the operator and every agent/participant
involved; it, not the conversation, is the source of truth.

This skill governs the **canonical effort pattern**. Each adopting repo adds a
short **addendum** that specializes only the bindings (grouping, participants,
extra sections). The full reference is
[`references/efforts.md`](references/efforts.md); the README template is
[`assets/TEMPLATE.md`](assets/TEMPLATE.md).

## First: resolve the effort home, then read its addendum

Efforts are standalone. If no external state-root binding is in play, the
effort home is simply the current repo root; the repo does **not** need to be
registered as an agent-worktrees harness. If `agent-worktrees` is installed,
ask it whether this repo redirects personal state to a bound knowledge repo:

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> state-root        # optional; prints the effort home when available
```

- **Command unavailable** → use the current repo root as the effort home.
- **Exit 0** → use the printed state root. In the default case this is the
  current repo; for a stateless harness / `requires_external_state_root: true`,
  it is the bound knowledge repo.
- **Non-zero exit** → if the repo requires an external state root, stop and bind
  the knowledge repo first; otherwise use the current repo root.

`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> state-root --json` gives the full resolution (`source`, `repo`,
`stateless`, `requires_external`, `bound`) when you need to explain where the
effort landed. All `efforts/` paths below are relative to the resolved effort
home.

Before acting, find the effort home's **efforts addendum** — it overrides the
defaults below for this repo. Look in `<effort-home>/efforts/README.md` (a
`## Local conventions` section) or a linked binding doc (e.g.
`docs/efforts.md`). The addendum sets:

- **Grouping** — flat (`efforts/active/<slug>/`) or by-repo
  (`efforts/active/<repo>/<slug>/`).
- **Archive layout** — the dated path pattern.
- **Participants binding** — the concrete label (machines / CodeSpaces /
  containers / branches) and how each is reached.
- **Section deltas** — any renames/additions to the README schema.
- **Repo rules** — which tracker holds issues; where new efforts are sourced.

If no addendum exists, the effort home has not adopted efforts yet — use the
`efforts-setup` skill there first.

## Bind the active worktree when agent-worktrees is available

The efforts plugin remains standalone, but an agent-worktrees-managed worktree
can durably bind its current objective to one canonical effort. Use the exact
`argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for every
`effort-focus` operation below. Replace
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with that raw path and quote it at the shell
call site on POSIX; in PowerShell invoke it as
`& "<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>" <args>`.

After the effort's Participants/Coordination and Plan/Validation Plan are filled
in, use the participant exactly as its table label and the slice exactly as its
Plan heading:

```
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus bind efforts/active/<slug>/README.md \
  --participant "<declared participant>" \
  --slice "<declared phase or slice>"
```

- **Command unavailable or worktree untracked** → continue with the standalone
  effort lifecycle; optional integration must not block planning.
- **Validation refused** → correct the effort's real declaration or continue
  unbound. Never invent a participant/slice merely to satisfy the command, and
  never hand-edit the worktree record.
- **A binding already exists** → inspect it with
  `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus show --json`. Reuse it when it
  names this objective; pass
  `--replace` only when the effort records an explicit replacement or slice
  transition.
- **Several worktrees share one effort** → each binds a distinct declared slice;
  participants identify the actors, but changing participants does not permit
  two worktrees to own the same slice.
- **The canonical effort is outside this worktree's repository** → do not bind
  the external path. Continue the standalone lifecycle, or bind a declared local
  sub-effort when the adopting repo's addendum defines one.
- The binding is repository-relative and record-local. Never create a
  repository-global "current effort" file.

An open binding derives the existing worktree `follow_up` gate and concise
summary. Do not clear it with `status --resolved`; release responsibility
through the effort lifecycle below.

While bound, use compact context handoffs: effort README pointer,
participant/current slice, immediate next slice, material blockers or
decisions, in-flight work, and required confirmations. Do not copy the durable
Request, Plan, Validation Plan, or Journal into the handoff. Standalone
objectives with no valid open effort retain the full handoff shape.

## When to use efforts vs. other constructs

| Use… | When the thing is… |
|------|--------------------|
| an **effort** (`efforts/`) | a stretch of work to plan and drive — plan + progress |
| a **doc** | truth about how something works — *what is* |
| an **issue** (tracker) | a discrete tracked item — *to do* |

Efforts and issues go hand in hand: an effort opens an umbrella issue and
breaks into sub-issues. **Only issues in *this* repo may directly link effort
files in this repo.**

## Start an effort

1. **Find the seed.** An effort starts pointing at something that already
   exists — an issue, a plan/roadmap doc, or a stated idea. Identify and cite
   it.
2. **Derive a kebab-case slug** and confirm it with the operator.
3. **Create the folder** at the grouped path (per the addendum): copy the
   effort home's `efforts/TEMPLATE.md` to the new effort's `README.md`. If the
   repo template is missing, run `efforts-setup`; that template is scaffolded
   from this skill's `assets/TEMPLATE.md`.
4. **Fill the header + Guiding Intent + Request** — capture the operator's ask
   **verbatim**; don't paraphrase the premise away. Then **validate the
   capture** before moving on (see *Validate the capture* below) — this
   requirement applies here and at every later rewrite.
5. **Catalog participants.** If the work spans machines/CodeSpaces/containers,
   fill the `## Participants` section (binding + how each is reached, per the
   addendum).
6. **Track it.** If the work warrants tracking, open an umbrella issue and
   cross-link it in the header.
7. **Commit** the effort file on the working branch.

## Validate the capture, then demarcate enhancements

Every write to an effort's `README.md` that captures or updates operator
intent — at creation, and at any later point where new operator guidance
lands (a follow-up round, a resumed session, a direction change) — carries an
explicit obligation: **before treating the write as done, re-read it back
against the operator's actual words and confirm nothing was paraphrased away,
softened, or silently added.** A captured effort that quietly drifts from
what the operator actually said is worse than no capture at all, because it
reads as authoritative.

- **Validate against the source, within reason.** Compare the README's
  Request/Guiding Intent/Plan against the operator's literal input for the
  round just captured. Flag it back to the operator, in the same turn, when
  you: omitted a stated constraint, softened a firm decision into an open
  question, or added scope the operator didn't ask for.
- **Demarcate agent-recommended enhancements.** Anything in the Plan,
  Validation Plan, or Context that originated from the agent's own analysis
  rather than the operator's stated request must be visibly marked as such —
  an inline `_(agent-recommended)_` tag, or a dedicated subsection — so a
  later reader (the operator, a reviewer, a resuming agent) can tell "the
  operator asked for this" from "the agent proposed this and it was
  accepted." Don't let recommended and requested content blend into one
  undifferentiated list.
- **Accumulate, then summarize.** A short back-and-forth (a clarifying
  question, one follow-up round) can be captured verbatim inline in
  **Request**, appended in sequence. Once operator input spans several rounds
  or the verbatim text would dominate the README, stop accumulating inline:
  write a **gist** in Request/Context (the settled premise, in your own
  words, clearly labeled as a summary) and move the full back-and-forth to a
  sidecar file.
- **The sidecar: `<effort-folder>/inception-transcript.md`.** When the
  verbatim record no longer belongs inline, create this file holding the full
  operator-agent exchange that produced the effort (or a later major
  direction change), and link it from the README's Request/Context section
  (e.g. "Full inception exchange: `inception-transcript.md`"). This keeps the
  README a navigable map — its own stated purpose — without losing the
  authoritative record of what was actually said.
- **Redaction is the one safety exception to verbatim capture** when the
  repo is public/externally-shareable and the operator's own words name a
  real private/internal identifier — never drop or soften the surrounding
  *intent* to work around it, only the private specifics it doesn't depend
  on. See *Keep internal specifics out of a public-facing effort*
  (`references/efforts.md`) for the full technique, including why a name
  swap alone is sometimes not enough and why the public README never links
  to a private sidecar.

## Plan an effort

- Fill **Context** (background + sourced issues/plans), **Plan** (phased,
  checklisted), and **Validation Plan**.
- **Decompose large phases/slices into linked sub-docs.** The README is loaded
  whole every time an agent resumes the effort, so keep it a navigable map. When a
  phase or slice grows a big self-contained body — a detailed sub-plan, deep design
  notes, its own validation matrix — extract it to a sibling sub-doc
  (`<effort-folder>/<phase>.md`) and leave the Plan a checklist item with a
  one-line summary and a link. The agent reads the sub-doc **only when working that
  phase**, cutting upfront context (the trade is an extra read on demand). Link out
  *and* back; no orphan sub-docs. This is the same *decompose-liberally* bias docs
  and visions follow.
- **Split a large journal by date.** The Journal is append-only — the one section
  that grows without bound. When it (inline or an extracted `journal.md`) nears the
  ~800-line soft cap, break it into dated files
  `<effort-folder>/journal/<YYYY>/MM.DD <title>.md` (one per day / notable
  entry, mirroring the archive's date scheme) and keep `journal.md` (or the README
  Journal section) as a **thin chronological index** linking them newest-first. Link
  out *and* back; no orphan entries.
- **Be validation-driven:** every effort carries an implementation plan *and* a
  validation/test plan. An effort may *start* as a pure reproduction — a
  failing validation captured first, fix to follow.
- **Additive or subtractive.** Most efforts *build* something (an additive delta:
  a required capability is missing). An effort can equally be **subtractive** —
  its goal is to **remove** a capability. A subtractive effort must trace to an
  **explicit removal intent** (a stated "no X" / decommission decision), never to
  the *mere absence* of a mention in some source — silence is not a removal order.
  Its Validation Plan proves the capability is **gone** *and* that nothing
  depending on it broke (callers, docs, configs, downstream services).
- File **sub-issues** for discrete tracked work; link them in the header.

## Submit for review, then execute (the review gate)

Between **planning** and **execution** sits a gate: an effort's plan should be
*reviewed* before work starts against it. After the operator's own review rounds
(this is where a rubber-duck pass normally lands), **if the control repo offers
automated PR review**, submit the effort itself as a PR and let it clear that
gate before executing:

1. **Submit the effort PR** — open a PR for the effort folder, with the
   provider's **auto-merge** enabled so an approving review lands it hands-off.
2. **Await approval + merge** — the automated reviewer (and/or the operator)
   approves; auto-merge merges it.
3. **Sync forward** — pull the worktree onto the merged (squashed) default branch
   so execution builds *on top of* the reviewed plan. In an agent-worktrees repo,
   use `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git sync` (see the
   `agent-worktrees:git-collaboration` skill); otherwise
   use the repo's normal pull-forward command. Then begin executing the Plan.

**The operator may waive their *own* review — but the agent's review-gate is
non-optional when automated review is available.** Always route the plan through
it before starting the project: it guarantees a reviewed plan, cross-agent
visibility (others can dedupe/co-work instead of starting parallel work), and a
crash-recovery point if the driving agent dies.

**Graceful degradation:** if the repo has no automated PR review (or isn't
PR-gated at all), the gate collapses to "commit the plan, then execute" — there
is nothing to wait on. Don't block on a gate the repo doesn't provide.

## Keep the effort current (while executing)

The README is the shared contract — keep it **ahead of the conversation**. But
**every effort edit that lands upstream costs its own PR**, so don't thrash it:

- **Batch updates** to moments that matter — a **major research or direction
  change**, a phase boundary, or when there are **other concurrent commits that
  need pushing anyway**. Routine checkbox ticks can ride along with the next
  substantive change.
- **Annotate as you go:** mark Plan items complete, adjust pending designs,
  re-prioritize on feedback, and journal decisions/blockers/dispatches. A
  feedback round that changes the Request/Plan is itself a rewrite —
  re-apply *Validate the capture, then demarcate enhancements* above before
  moving on.
- **By code-complete**, the README reflects the coding-done state and, at most,
  names the *next* effort that carries the work forward (deploy / smoke-test /
  delegation) — it does not try to own that next stretch.
- **Record merged PRs, not in-flight ones.** Listing a PR that the *current*
  commit is itself opening is a catch-22; record a PR only once it has merged.
  Remark open issues the effort spawned or still blocks on.

## Keep internal specifics out of a public-facing effort

When the effort's own repo is public/externally-shareable, its Journal,
Context, Request, and any linked sub-doc can't carry the same concrete detail
a private knowledge repo's effort would — a real private/internal repo or
system name, a private cross-organization issue reference, or a blow-by-blow
internal-investigation narrative is exactly the kind of content that leaks,
even inside an effort folder that otherwise looks like ordinary engineering
notes. This is not a rule against cross-repo references in general — a
fully-qualified reference to a genuinely *public* repo remains expected
traceability. See *Keep internal specifics out of a public-facing effort* in
`references/efforts.md` for the full technique (abstract the specifics
rather than omitting the lesson, route the un-abstracted record to a private
knowledge repo without linking to it from the public side, and apply the
same bar everywhere, not just Journal entries).

## Drive to completion, relentlessly

A durably-journaled effort is what makes relentless driving safe: because the
README and its Journal — not the conversation or a single session's memory —
already carry the plan, the decisions, and what happened, the head session can
keep selecting and executing the next Plan item across phases, PRs, and
session boundaries **without waiting to be re-prompted for each step**. This
is the `continue-until-closed` behavior the `efforts` vision commits to: the
rightful head keeps driving until the effort's own completion gate is
satisfied, not until one relay leg, PR, or checklist item happens to finish.

In particular, **opening or pushing a reviewable change is not a stopping
point** — it's mid-flight. Once a PR (or equivalent reviewable gate) exists,
stay on it: watch for the verdict, and act on it immediately — once the
target repo's own documented verdict/merge gate is satisfied (read that
repo's own CONTRIBUTING-equivalent doc for what "satisfied" actually means
there; many repos' automated reviewers never render a literal `Approve` on
certain PRs — e.g. a repo owner's own self-merge PRs — and define a
different passing shape instead, such as a clean non-blocking review with no
Medium/High finding left open), merge; otherwise address requested changes
and re-push, or resolve a conflict — through to merge, then continue with
the effort's next Plan item. Do not assume "wait for Approve" as a universal
rule, and do not trust a generic tooling field (e.g. a raw `eligible`/
`reason` pair) over that repo's own documented verdict-shape when the two
disagree (`agent-worktrees`'s own `pr-workflow.md` reference, "Default
conduct: drive every PR you open through to merge," covers this in more
detail, including a precedent (`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3638`)
where exactly this confusion stalled *merging* an already-converged PR for
roughly 90 minutes past the point the target repo's own docs already called
done — a separate problem from why that PR's review took 25 rounds to
converge in the first place, which was carried-over review findings not
clearing after being fixed, not this verdict/bypass confusion).
Journal the outcome as you go so the next slice starts from a durable record,
not from memory of what "should" happen next.

**Stop short of driving further only for a genuine blocker:**

- an **error** that needs diagnosis before it's safe to continue;
- a **design crossroads** — a decision only the operator can make;
- a **safety rail** — a destructive action, or anything else, that requires
  explicit confirmation before proceeding;
- a **handoff boundary** where automatic cutover to a successor session isn't
  available (see the `context-handoff` skill, when present) — hand off
  explicitly, naming the blocker and the next actionable step, rather than
  stopping silently.

None of these are satisfied by "this is a suitable stopping point," "the
session has run long," or a completed phase/PR/handoff/session in isolation —
those are exactly the false stops the effort's own completion gate exists to
catch.

## Cross-repo efforts — where the effort folder lives

When an effort touches **another** repo, placement follows validated target
capability, not directory presence, repository names, or private assumptions.
Resolve an authoritative local target checkout/worktree through its owning
repository tool first. Then resolve this skill's owning efforts plugin root by
walking two parents up from this skill's base directory and run the native
read-only probe:

```bash
bash <efforts-plugin-root>/scripts/emit-policy.sh --check-adoption <absolute-target-path>
```

```powershell
& <efforts-plugin-root>\scripts\emit-policy.ps1 -CheckAdoption <absolute-target-path>
```

Only exact JSON
`{"version":1,"capability":"efforts","adopted":true}` proves compatible
adoption. `{}`, malformed output, an unavailable checkout, and a remote-only
target all mean **host-owned orchestration**. Do not execute target code, source
target files, or fetch individual remote files to manufacture a capability
answer.

After that check, choose among the placement models below. **Host-owned
orchestration is the default** — capability permits a target to own one
canonical target-local effort, it does not silently move ownership out of the
host. Full description of each model, and the several-hosts-one-target rule:
[`references/efforts.md`](references/efforts.md) § Cross-repo placement.

- **Local / tracking-only (default)** — the folder stays in *this* repo and
  tracks work landing elsewhere.
- **Build directly in the target repo** — only when the exact probe proves
  adoption *and* the stretch is genuinely about that repo; author it there,
  through that repo's own flow, keeping only a one-way reference back in the
  host.
- **Hybrid (split public/private)** — a canonical public/generalized effort
  plus a private one that links to and elaborates it, never the reverse.

Never create drifting peer copies, reciprocal ownership links, or a second
target-local effort for the same scope: the first host to collaborate on a
compatible target claims it through that target's normal coordination flow,
and later hosts discover and reference that same effort.

**One ordering rule holds across all three: propose before you do.** Reviewers
can't meaningfully comment on external work that's already committed, so:

1. Submit the **proposal** (the not-yet-done plan) to PR first; await review.
2. Make the external changes once the plan clears.
3. Report completion as a **separate delta** ("this is now done"), which reviews
   easily because the only change is status.

When a stretch spans a **review-gated** control repo *and* a **directly-pushed**
target, land the **reviewed intent** (the effort/plan PR) before the unreviewed
change that realizes it.

## Resume an effort

1. Pull latest so the Journal is current, then **read the README** — Status,
   Plan checklists, Blockers, and the latest Journal entries.
2. When agent-worktrees is available, inspect
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus show --json` and bind this
   effort/slice if it is not already the worktree's active focus.
3. Pick up from the last incomplete checklist item / Journal entry. The README
   is self-contained by design — a fresh agent session resumes from the file.
4. For multi-participant work, dispatch via the bound executor (the addendum
   says how) and **journal the dispatch** so the coordination record stays in
   the file.
5. Keep the Journal ahead of the conversation as you work.

## Archive an effort

1. Confirm the effort is done (or abandoned) and the Journal reflects the
   outcome.
2. Resolve every Plan and Validation Plan item. A transferred item must use one
   of the machine-checked forms
   `- [x] Deferred to \`<tracked objective>\`: <original item>` or
   `- [x] Blocked; transferred to \`<tracked objective>\`: <original item>`.
   Then set **Status: Done**.
3. **Move** the active effort folder to the dated archive path (per the
   addendum), using the completion date. Preserve git history with `git mv`.
4. Write a closing Journal entry.
5. Update the active index in `efforts/README.md`.
6. **Promote durable truth:** if the effort established how something now
   *works*, capture that in the repo's docs. The archived effort is a record of
   *what happened*, not living documentation.
7. Land the archive change through the repo's normal review and merge gate.
8. From the still-bound managed worktree, release with
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus release --completed`, then
   finalize the worktree. The command verifies `Status: Done` and every resolved
   Plan/Validation Plan checkbox on the effort README, whether it is still at the
   active path or already at the standard flat or by-repo dated archive path. If
   responsibility moves instead, name the receiving tracked objective with
   `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> effort-focus release --transfer
   "<issue/effort>"`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Acting before reading the repo's addendum (you'll use the wrong grouping /
  participants).
- ❌ New planning docs outside `efforts/` for fresh planning work → start an
  effort.
- ❌ Paraphrasing the premise instead of capturing the **Request** verbatim.
- ❌ Writing or updating an effort README from operator input without
  validating the capture against the operator's actual words before moving
  on — silently dropping a constraint, softening a decision into an open
  question, or adding unrequested scope.
- ❌ Letting agent-recommended Plan/Validation Plan/Context items blend in,
  undemarcated, with operator-requested ones.
- ❌ Letting a multi-round verbatim Request balloon inline instead of
  summarizing the gist and moving the full exchange to
  `inception-transcript.md`.
- ❌ Letting the conversation, not the README, hold effort state.
- ❌ Journaling a real **private/internal** repo or system name, a private
  cross-org reference, or unabstracted incident narrative into a
  public-facing effort — abstract the specifics or route the precise record
  to a private knowledge repo instead. (A fully-qualified reference to a
  genuinely *public* repo remains expected traceability, not a leak.)
- ❌ Clearing `follow_up` manually while an open effort remains bound, or
  dropping the binding without verified completion or a named transfer.
- ❌ Cross-repo issues linking this repo's effort paths.
- ❌ Duplicating the *same* effort in two repos with no canonical source — in a
  hybrid split, the **public generalized** effort is canonical and the private,
  fuller one links to it (don't let two copies drift into two sources of truth).
- ❌ Authoring an effort **here** for work that is genuinely *about a target repo
  that has adopted `efforts/`* — build it in the target (as a good citizen) or
  use the hybrid split, rather than reflexively keeping it local.
- ❌ Naming an effort `feature-*` / `bug-*` / `task-*`.
- ❌ Putting participant-specific mechanics in the core schema — keep them in
  `## Participants` and the addendum, so the pattern stays portable.
- ❌ Starting execution before the plan clears its review gate when automated
  review is available (submit the effort PR → merge → sync forward → *then*
  execute).
- ❌ Recording an in-flight PR the current commit is itself opening (a catch-22) —
  record a PR only once it has merged.
- ❌ Thrashing the effort with a PR per checkbox — batch edits to direction
  changes, phase boundaries, or commits that need pushing anyway.
- ❌ Letting the README balloon with every phase's full detail inline — extract
  large phases/slices to linked sibling sub-docs (`<effort-folder>/<phase>.md`) and keep the
  Plan a map, so a resuming agent loads only the phase it is working.
- ❌ Stopping after opening or pushing a reviewable change and waiting to be
  re-prompted — stay on it through review, consent, and merge before moving on
  or ending the turn.
