  Diagnose problems with deployed copilot-extensions plugins -- a plugin update
  that "succeeds" but changes nothing, a missing binstub, a skill that won't
  load, the agent-bridge service not responding, MCP tools unavailable in a
  sub-agent, or a stale runtime. The primary, hard-guidance skill for any
  consumer: identify what belongs to this system, and never hand-patch a
  deployed copy -- file a bug upstream or auto-update instead. Symptom -> cause
  -> action, key paths, diagnostic commands, and the baseline-reset escape
  hatch. Use when something is wrong with an installed plugin or its runtime.
  Trigger phrases include:
  - 'agent-worktrees not found'
  - 'agent-bridge not responding'
  - 'plugin update did nothing'
  - 'already at latest but stale'
  - 'skill not loading'
  - 'binstub missing'
  - 'command not found'
  - 'mcp tools unavailable'
  - 'diagnose copilot-extensions'
  - 'reset copilot extensions'

# Diagnosing copilot-extensions

Something's wrong with a deployed plugin. **Diagnose before remediating** — an
error names a symptom, not a root cause. Read the literal error, form a
hypothesis, gather evidence, and only then act. For an idempotent step a single
retry is a fine first move; never force-deploy or kill a process on a hunch.

## Hard rule: identify it, don't patch it

This is the primary purpose of this skill, and it binds **every** consumer of
the suite, whether or not they ever contribute:

1. **Identify what belongs to this system first.** Before reasoning about any
   local script, process, config file, or running service, check it against
   **Where things live** below. If a path, binstub, or process isn't listed
   there, don't assume it's ours.
2. **Never monkey-patch.** Do not hand-edit an installed/deployed plugin
   payload (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/...`) or a running runtime
   (`~/.agent-*`) to work around a bug, "just this once" or otherwise. A local
   edit is invisible to every other consumer, gets silently overwritten by the
   next update, and leaves the real defect unfixed. There are exactly two
   sanctioned responses when something is actually broken:
   - **File a bug upstream** — open (or find and comment on) a GitHub issue on
     `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions`, written in generic, sanitized terms: no
     PII, internal paths/hostnames, account details, or proprietary/downstream
     context (see `contributing-to-copilot-extensions`'s *Sanitization* rule
     and its worked examples in
     [`references/sanitization-examples.md`](../../references/sanitization-examples.md)). This is the right move even if
     you never intend to fix it yourself.
   - **Run the auto-update/reset path** — `<repo> update` (or `--force`), or
     the baseline reset below, if the deployed copy is simply stale or
     corrupted rather than genuinely buggy.
   - The **only** other sanctioned path is becoming a real contributor: fixing
     the repo source itself and landing it through
     `contributing-to-copilot-extensions`'s worktree/PR flow — never the
     deployed copy directly.

## Where things live

| What | Path |
|------|------|
| Installed plugin payloads | `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/copilot-extensions/<plugin>/` |
| Runtime roots | `~/.agent-*` (for example `~/.agent-worktrees/`, `~/.agent-bridge/`, `~/.agent-codespaces/`, `~/.agent-containers/`, `~/.agent-mcp/`, `~/.agent-logger/`, `~/.agent-dispatch/`, `~/.agent-index/`, `~/.agent-vault/`) <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| **Writable source checkout** | Resolve it, don't assume it's undocumented -- run `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> related resolve copilot-extensions` (the exact `argv[0]` from the session command catalog, never a bare PATH lookup; or the equivalent for another plugin-suite repo). A runtime-only path above is never the only copy; concluding a source-location gap without running this first is the mistake, not a real gap. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| Versioned slots | Python runtimes build immutable slots under `~/.agent-<name>/versions/<version>/`, publish `current-version`, and stamp `deploy-manifest.json` / completion markers |
| Binstubs | `~/.local/bin/agent-*` (`.ps1` primary + `.cmd` fallback on Windows) <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| Enablement | `~/.copilot/settings.json` (`experimental: true`) + repo `.github/copilot/settings.json` (`enabledPlugins` / `extraKnownMarketplaces`) |
| Catalog | `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` in the repo |

## Symptom → cause → action

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `copilot plugin update` says **"already at latest"** but the code is stale | Version not bumped before merge (marketplace compares versions) | Check the plugin's `plugins[N].version` in the repo vs the deployed `plugin.json`; the fix is a version bump on the *source* side (see `contributing-to-copilot-extensions`). |
| `plugin update` **succeeded** but the runtime behaves unchanged | Payload refreshed, **runtime not redeployed** — the CLI's "updated" message is payload-only | Use the unified deploy path: `<repo> update` (normally `agent-worktrees update`) on the machine. If the payload/runtime have the same version but content drift is suspected, use `<repo> update --force`. Per-plugin `install.*` / `init.*` is only a local-testing or recovery path. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployment-management --> |
| `agent-worktrees` / `agent-bridge` **command not found** | Runtime not installed, `~/.local/bin` not on PATH, or an earlier PATH entry shadows the binstub | Check `Get-Command agent-worktrees -All` / `which -a agent-worktrees`; ensure `~/.local/bin` wins; run `<repo> update` to reconcile missing runtime/binstubs. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| A **skill won't load** in a session | `experimental` off, plugin not enabled, or session not restarted (plugins scan at startup) | Confirm `experimental: true` in `~/.copilot/settings.json`; confirm the plugin in `enabledPlugins`; **restart the session**. |
| **agent-bridge not responding** | Service not running, stale routing table, or client assuming an old fixed port | `agent-bridge status` (it resolves the live dynamic port); use `<repo> update` / `agent-bridge status` evidence before restarting. On POSIX check the user service; on Windows current service lifecycle may be user-mode, with legacy scheduled-task artifacts only if installed earlier. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| Bridge runs but a **remote send fails** | SSH transport, not the bridge | Test the SSH alias directly; check topology with `agent-bridge machines` / `agent-bridge agents`; fix the alias/key before touching the service. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| Windows: **two `python.exe` daemons**, or one running from `C:\Program Files\Python3XX\python.exe`, looks rogue | **Normal** stdlib-venv shape, not a bug: the versioned-slot `Scripts\python.exe` is a `venvlauncher.exe` **supervisor** that re-execs the **base** interpreter as its **worker** (the worker is what binds the port). It's still the slot's code. | Confirm one daemon: worker's **PPID = the slot-path supervisor**, same start time, `active.json` names the canonical pid; slot `pyvenv.cfg` `home` = the base. Don't `Stop-Process` the `Program Files` worker as "global/rogue". See `agent-bridge-troubleshooting` § split-brain. |
| **MCP tools unavailable** in a sub-agent | agent-mcp bridge not wired / not ready | Verify the agent's `mcp-servers` entry and the `agent-mcp` bridge config; honor the MCP-readiness pattern (report unavailability, fall back to CLI). |
| Runtime seems **half-upgraded / corrupt** | Interrupted install, incomplete versioned slot, or same-version drift | Run `<repo> update --force`; if still broken, use the runtime's own uninstall/reinstall path or the baseline reset scope below. |

## Diagnostic commands

```bash
copilot plugin list                          # what's installed + enabled
agent-worktrees update --force               # marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics
agent-worktrees --version && agent-worktrees status # marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics
agent-bridge version && agent-bridge status  # marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics
agent-codespaces version                     # marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics
agent-mcp status                             # marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics
```

Compare a deployed `plugin.json` version against the repo's
`marketplace.json` `plugins[N].version` to confirm whether a machine is actually
behind or the source was never bumped.

## Baseline reset (escape hatch)

When the core runtimes are wedged and you want a clean baseline, the repo ships
an idempotent reset that works even when the CLIs are broken. **Current reset
scope is the original core trio**: `agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`, and
`agent-codespaces`; it removes their `~/.agent-*` runtime roots, bridge/relay
service artifacts, project binstubs, and (optionally) marketplace plugins /
per-project configs. Verify `~/.local/bin` afterward, especially on Windows
where current runtimes deploy `.ps1` + `.cmd` binstub siblings. The reset does
**not** claim to reset every newer runtime root (for example agent-mcp,
agent-dispatch, agent-index, agent-vault); use that plugin's uninstall/reinstall
path or remove its `~/.agent-*` root only after verifying it is not running.

```powershell
pwsh -File tools\reset.ps1                       # prompts; -Yes to skip
pwsh -File tools\reset.ps1 -Yes -RemovePlugins   # also copilot plugin uninstall
```
```bash
bash tools/reset.sh                              # prompts; --yes to skip
bash tools/reset.sh --yes --remove-plugins
```

Your source repos and their `.worktrees` are never touched.

## Reference

`docs/architecture.md` (runtimes, ports, the payload/runtime split),
`docs/install-contract.md` (the runtime-plugin contract), and each plugin's own
`docs/getting-started.md`. **Only if you're actually contributing a real,
versioned fix** — not patching the deployed copy — does the path continue to
`contributing-to-copilot-extensions`.
