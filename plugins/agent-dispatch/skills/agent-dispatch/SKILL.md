`agent-dispatch` is a **portable agent task-queue**. A per-host **coordinator**
(a single-writer SQLite/WAL daemon) hands out an **atomic leased claim** over a
queue of *tasks*, so multiple agents coordinate without racing through
`origin/master` pushes or needing a dedicated account each.

A **task** is a graduated handoff: a title + `prompt` + optional Markdown
`payload`. It carries routing (`requires` / `affinity`), targeting
(`target_machine` / `target_worktree` / `target_repo`, `labels`), optional
spawn exclusivity (`exclusive_key`), and moves through a nine-state lifecycle.

## When to reach for it

- You want to **hand work to another agent** (same machine or another) without
  babysitting it -- enqueue a task, let a capable worker claim it.
- **Several agents** could do a piece of work and exactly one should -- the
  atomic claim guarantees a single winner.
- A **crashed/full-auto agent** must not hold work forever -- a liveness GC pass
  returns the task to the queue once its owner worktree is confirmed gone.
- You're **graduating a context-handoff** into durable, browsable, claimable
  work instead of a dead-end paste-prompt.

Not for: cross-machine *conversation* (that's agent-bridge `send`), or spawning
a local sub-agent in *this* session (that's the Task tool). agent-dispatch is
the **durable task loop**; agent-bridge is an optional producer/subscriber
alongside it. It is also not a generic process or service lifecycle manager:
service installers and process supervisors remain with their owning system.

### Responsibility boundary

- Use a native Task sub-agent for bounded work inside the current session.
- Use **`agent-bridge:agent-bridge`** when the caller must converse with,
  steer, wait on, or take over a live agent across a boundary.
- Use agent-dispatch when durable task state is required: a queued handoff,
  deduplicated claim, capability/affinity routing, reactive or scheduled
  production, retry, supervision, or terminal task record.

A dispatched task may launch an agent-bridge-backed worker, but that composition
does not transfer ownership: agent-dispatch owns the task loop; agent-bridge
owns the live session transport. For generic task decomposition and the
decision to delegate at all, use
**`delegation-guidance:delegating-work`**.

**agent-dispatch's four canonical use cases** (they line up with the *Producers*
below): (1) **handoff-prompt storage** for an in-place cutover (same worktree,
next session); (2) **fire-and-forget delegation** to another worktree/machine;
(3) **reactive tasks** on automated events (critical detections / posted reviews
/ outages — tightly scoped, since workers are expensive); (4) **scheduled tasks**
(recurring producers). These four are the standing intent recorded in the
plugin vision (`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/` in the source repo).

## Prerequisite: a reachable coordinator

Every verb except `serve` is a thin client that talks to a coordinator over
HTTP. Point the CLI at one with `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL`; otherwise the client
discovers the local coordinator through the zdd routing table /
`~/.agent-dispatch/run/endpoint.json`, then falls back to legacy <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
`http://127.0.0.1:9847`. Add `AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` if it requires bearer auth. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> health          # confirm a coordinator is reachable first
```

- **Lone dev box:** run a loopback coordinator locally:
  `agent-dispatch serve` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow coordinator-management -->
  (or install it as a service -- see the plugin README). Local client verbs
  lazy-start a detached coordinator when none answers; `health` does not.
- **Shared network:** set `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` to the designated coordinator
  host; don't run a local one.

If `health` fails, start/point at a coordinator before anything else -- don't
retry claims against a dead URL.

### Local + shared: the hybrid (cross-machine) topology

Two coordinators can coexist. Keep your **local** loopback one for same-machine
work (handoffs, local scheduling), and point at a **shared/elected coordinator**
only for **cross-machine** dispatch — the queue every machine claims from. A
client picks per command:

- Set `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_URL` to the shared endpoint (in a multi-machine system, the
  always-on **hosted coordinator**; standalone, whichever mesh peer is elected to host it),
  and `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN` for its bearer (independent of the local
  token — the two authenticate separately).
- Add `--shared` to any client verb to target it:
  `<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> --shared create …`,
  `<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> --shared list`,
  `<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> --shared claim …`, and
  `agent-dispatch --shared supervise --pool …`. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow supervisor-management -->
  Omit `--shared` for the local
  coordinator. An explicit `--url` always overrides both.
- The shared coordinator **binds loopback behind the secured mesh** and
  is reached by **client-initiated outbound** calls + bearer — never a raw LAN
  bind. A tunnel-only machine (reachable outbound only) therefore participates
  natively: it just calls out like everyone else.
- `--shared` with no `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_URL` set **errors loudly** rather
  than silently using the local queue (which would strand a cross-machine task).

Dispatch-for-others and see-and-take-others' both ride this shared queue: enqueue
with `--shared create --target-machine <m>`, and the target machine runs
`--shared list` / `--shared claim` to pick up what's addressed to it.

## Worker identity -- resolved from your CWD

An agent's identity is the **`machine`/`worktree` pair** -- the only durable
agent id available. `claim` and `worktree-status` **auto-resolve it from the
current directory** by delegating to `agent-worktrees` (the same way git finds
its repo). So from inside your worktree you pass **no** identity flags:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> worktree-status     # my inbox: tasks targeted at + owned by me
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> claim               # lease an eligible task; owner is auto-stamped
```

**Inbox before invention.** At session start and before choosing new work, run
`worktree-status`. Resume or claim a task explicitly targeted at this worktree
before self-selecting unrelated work, unless it conflicts with the operator's
current request. A targeted assignment is durable intent; do not overlook it
because a broad backlog query found something newer.

Override (or supply, when `agent-worktrees` is absent) with `--machine` /
`--worktree`. **Do not** invent an identity or type one by hand when the CWD can
resolve it -- let the resolution stand.

**Claim honors targeting:** a worker only leases tasks that are **untargeted**
or **targeted at its own** machine/worktree. That's what makes a bound handoff
stick to its worktree while a portable task floats to anyone.

## Repo lanes -- tasks stay in their own repo

Every task belongs to a **repo lane** -- the canonical remote of the *producing
agent's harness repo*. **Repos stay in their own lanes:** a task made by a
`webapp` agent is for `webapp` agents, and every subcommand is
**scoped to the calling repo by default**. You never see or claim another repo's
tasks. Like identity, the lane is **auto-resolved from your CWD** (via
`agent-worktrees get repo-remote`, falling back to `git remote get-url origin`), <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow agent-worktrees-management -->
so you pass nothing:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "..."      # lane auto-stamped from the calling repo
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> sweep             # dedup corpus for THIS repo only
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> list --status queued
```

- **Cross-repo *code* work stays in the producing lane.** If a `webapp`
  agent wants a change made in a `shared-lib` repo, it files the task in the
  **webapp** lane (optionally tagging the code target with
  `--target-repo shared-lib`). Another **webapp** agent picks it
  up and does the cross-repo work via the **`working-cross-repo`** flow -- it
  does **not** spawn a `shared-lib` harness. (Some repos are edited only as a
  target, never run as a harness.)
- **Targeting another lane is explicit.** `--repo <name|remote>` scopes a command
  to a specific other lane (`--repo webapp` or a full remote URL). `list`,
  `find`, and `sweep` are lane-scoped by default; `inbox` is the intentional
  machine-scoped, cross-lane picker view, and `supervise --all-repos` is an
  explicit service opt-in.
- **Claim fails closed without a lane.** Normal CLI, REST, and MCP claims require
  an explicit or CWD/header-resolved repo. Only an intentional coordinator-wide
  supervisor or administrator sets explicit `all_repos=true` / `--all-repos`.
- **Hybrid keys.** The wire/DB stores a device-independent **canonical remote**
  (so one shared coordinator keys every machine the same); the CLI lets you
  *type* and *reads back* the local repo **name** (resolved through the
  agent-worktrees registry). <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow agent-worktrees-management -->
  Output carries both `repo` (remote) and `repo_name`.

## The nine-state lifecycle

```
proposed -> queued -> claimed -> started -> submitted -> completed
                ^         |          |            |            (terminal)
                +- decline/yield ----+            |
                ^         |                       +-- confirm
                +- owner-gone (liveness GC requeue, attempts++)
started -> suspended -> started
               |                                   (resume; same owner)
               +-----------> queued                (release; replacement)
               +-----------> submitted             (condition resolved)
   (any non-terminal except completed) --> abandoned (terminal, permission-gated)
   (owner-gone past the attempts cap) --> dead_letter (terminal)
```

| State | Meaning | Claimable? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **proposed** | drafted / wording still undecided | No |
| **queued** | ready to be picked up | Yes |
| **claimed** | held; worker may evaluate before committing | held |
| **started** | under active implementation | held |
| **suspended** | previously started, dormant, same owner/session preserved | No |
| **submitted** | provisional completion claim | No |
| **completed** | corroborated done | terminal |
| **abandoned** | discarded (duplicate / dropped priority) | terminal |
| **dead_letter** | requeued too many times (owner kept going gone) -- an actionable failure | terminal |

- **proposed** is a holding state for an idea not yet blessed; `approve` moves it
  to **queued**.
- **claimed -> started** when the worker commits; **claimed -> queued**
  (`yield`, a decline) if it evaluates and passes. The `claimed` window is the
  **evaluation window** (`claim --evaluation`) -- a semantic "evaluating, not yet
  committed" marker; elapsed time alone does **not** recover it (see below).
- **started -> queued** yields **with a note** on a recoverable snag (merge
  conflict, needs a later cycle); **started -> submitted** on success, and **submitted -> completed** once corroborated by `confirm`.
- **started -> suspended** (`suspend --reason <why>`) is owner-gated and parks a
  dormant task without losing its owner/session identity, worktree, generation,
  progress, or card. It clears active lease/activity and is neither claimable nor
  subject to liveness GC/supervisor retry accounting. For an interactive owner,
  `resume` restores **suspended -> started** under that same owner and
  transactionally enqueues a durable asynchronous wake. A supervised owner
  without a captured interactive inbox is released to **queued** for safe
  re-embodiment;
  `release` clears ownership and returns it to **queued** for a replacement.
- **suspended -> submitted** is owner-gated and direct: if an external condition
  satisfies the dormant goal, its resolver calls `complete` under the preserved
  owner without waking a process or manufacturing an active turn.
- Steering a suspended task durably records the steer and atomically either
  restores an interactive task to **started** with a wake outbox row, or
  releases a task without a captured inbox to **queued** for re-embodiment. A newly embodied
  worker consumes pending steering immediately after start. The HTTP path never
  calls the bridge. The coordinator loop drains and retries interactive wakes
  across restarts with exponential backoff and a stable downstream idempotency
  key. Generation/owner-session/status/latest-wake fences retire stale
  operations after the task advances. Inspect `wakes <id>`, task events, or
  health metrics for pending/delivering/delivered/failed/stale state. The steer
  and runnable task state survive every delivery failure. Wakes are
  edge-triggered, so every resumed/replacement worker runs
  `steer take <id> --all` to atomically drain all pending answers; `suspend`
  refuses to park while an untaken steer exists.
- **abandon requires permission** (`--permit`, or `--duplicate-of <ref>` which
  self-permits and records the dedup reference) -- it's not a unilateral agent
  action; it's the discard path for duplicates / dropped priorities.
- **owner-gone -> queued** is automatic and internal (bumps `attempts`): a held
  task is requeued **only when its owner worktree is confirmed gone** by a
  **liveness** garbage-collection pass -- never on elapsed time, so a
  long-running live worker is never disturbed and a momentary bridge blip
  (verdict *unknown*) leaves the task alone. The coordinator runs GC on a timer
  (`AGENT_DISPATCH_GC_INTERVAL`, default 60s);
  `<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recover` forces a
  pass on demand. (There is **no** lease TTL: recovery is reconciled against live
  workers, not a clock.)

## The everyday flow

### 1. Browse & dedup BEFORE creating

Always check for existing work before ideating a new task. The base dedup
mechanism is an **agent-driven sweep**: pull the corpus of live tasks, read
their descriptions, and verify with a normal *explore* pass whether the work
already exists. This is why every task must carry a **self-contained title +
prompt** -- enough for a sweeping agent to judge duplication without extra
context. The coordinator also backstops with a unique `dedup_key`.

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> sweep       # the dedup corpus: every non-abandoned
                                             #   task (proposed/queued/claimed/started/suspended/
                                             #   completed), newest first -- read these,
                                             #   then explore/verify before creating
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> find "narration track"        # quick substring probe over title/prompt
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> list --status queued,started  # filter by status (comma-separate for several),
                                             #   --target-machine/--target-repo/--label
```

> **VEI is a future optimization, not a requirement.** Correctness rests on the
> agent-driven sweep over descriptive task text; a semantic index (VEI) is a
> pluggable *performance* layer over the same corpus that can be added later
> without changing the flow. Keep the plugin portable -- it must dedup fine on a
> lone box with no shared VEI.

### 2. Create a task

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Add narration track" \
  --prompt "segment 42 needs a narration pass" \
  --require logger \                 # hard selector: only a worker advertising 'logger' can claim
  --exclude machine:flaky-box \      # hard anti-selector: that machine can NOT claim
  --affinity worktree=same \         # soft: bias toward the same worktree, never exclude
  --label media \
  --target-repo copilot-extensions \ # OPTIONAL: the cross-repo *code* target (stays in THIS lane)
  --dedup-key narration-seg42 \      # makes create idempotent
  --exclusive-key review:repo:42 \   # optional: one spawned worker for this logical resource
  --goal "segment 42 has a merged narration track" \  # durable objective (see Goal-loop tasks)
  --done-criteria "track rendered, reviewed, merged"  # when --goal is met
```

The **lane** (`--repo`) defaults to the calling repo -- omit it inside your
worktree. `--target-repo` is different: it's metadata naming the *code* a
cross-repo task touches; the task still lives in **your** lane and a same-lane
agent does the cross-repo work via `agent-worktrees:working-cross-repo`.

**Bind tracked bugs to one canonical task.** When work is selected from a
GitHub issue, first look for an existing task with the exact issue key. Reuse a
queued task with `claim --task <id>`; resume one already owned by this
worktree; stop if another live owner holds it. Only when no task exists, create
the first work episode with the issue identity for both provenance and dedup:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Fix owner/repo#42: concise title" \
  --prompt "Work https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42 end-to-end ..." \
  --source github-issue \
  --origin-ref issue/owner/repo#42 \
  --dedup-key issue:owner/repo#42 \
  --claim
```

For a newly created task, `claimed_by_me: true` means the issue is yours. If
create returns an existing row, inspect its `status` and `owner` instead of
treating `claimed_by_me: false` as an automatic loss: queued tasks can be
claimed, this worktree's active tasks can be resumed, another live owner's task
is a collision, and terminal history is not an active claim. A reopened issue
needs an explicit deterministic episode suffix derived from its reopen event,
for example `issue:owner/repo#42:reopen:<event-id>`.

To assign work across machines, use a shared coordinator
(`<argv[0]> --shared create ... --target-machine <m>`) or remote embodiment
(`--target-machine <m> --spawn --spawn-backend embody`). A bare
`--target-machine` against a local coordinator does not deliver an inbox item
to the other machine. When machines use separate coordinators and neither
delivery path is available, pair the local task with the issue tracker's
visible claim/assignment protocol; the queue cannot arbitrate a peer it cannot
see.

**Selectors — include (`--require`) and exclude (`--exclude`).** Both take
tokens over an open namespace; at claim time a worker's identity is folded into
its advertised set (`machine:<m>`, `worktree:<w>`, `repo:<lane>`) alongside its
capabilities, so a selector can target or exclude by **capability *or*
machine/worktree/repo**. A task is claimable only when every `--require` token is
present in the worker's set **and** no `--exclude` token is. Excludes are hard
anti-affinity (unlike soft `--affinity`, which only orders). A declining worker
can **append its own "not me"** on the way back to the queue with
`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> yield <id> --exclude-self {worktree,machine}`
(or `--exclude <token>`);
because excludes only grow, the candidate set shrinks monotonically to a taker or
to unclaimable.

**Atomic create-and-claim (`--claim`).** `create … --claim` inserts the task
**already claimed by your worktree in one transaction** (no queued gap). Combined
with `--dedup-key`, it is the safe **open-ended self-dispatch** primitive: on a
collision the existing (already-claimed) row is returned and `claimed_by_me` is
`false`, so you can tell you lost the race and re-pick. See the **`pick-and-claim`**
skill for the full sweep-then-claim protocol and the `dedup_key` conventions.

Write the title + prompt to be **self-describing** (see the sweep note above):
a producer scanning existing tasks should be able to tell yours apart from
theirs from the description alone.

Create a **draft** instead with `--proposed` (unclaimable until `approve`).
Defer with `--not-before <epoch>` (scheduled creation). Attach a payload with
`--payload-inline` (small), `--payload-file <path>` (reads a file; a large one
spills to a content-addressed blob automatically), or `--payload-ref` (an
external pointer like `pr/123`).

**Spawn exclusivity (`--exclusive-key`).** Use this when several task episodes
represent the same logical resource and only one spawned worker may ever hold it
at a time -- for example a PR review whose task key includes the changing head
SHA, but whose reviewer worktree must stay singular for the PR. The ordinary
`--dedup-key` still answers "is this exact task already present?"; the
`--exclusive-key` answers "is a worker already spawned for this resource?". A
new spawn reservation is refused while any active reservation with the same key
exists, even if it belongs to a different task id. When a prior reservation for
that key recorded a worktree, the next spawn first reuses that worktree so the
worker resumes the same durable context; if that soft reuse is gone/reaped, the
spawner may fall back to a fresh worktree under the same exclusive reservation.
Add `--supersede-exclusive-key` when the latest episode replaces older queued or
proposed episodes with the same key. It never yanks a claimed/started/suspended
worker; the active reservation is the hard no-second-worker guard.

### Goal-loop tasks — a durable goal a worker loops toward *(the norm for delegated work)*

A dispatched task is **not** a fire-once prompt — it is, by default, a **durable
goal an agent loops toward across turns and across embodiments.** Reach for
`--goal` + `--done-criteria` on any delegation that is an *objective* rather than
a single mechanical step; a plain one-shot prompt (no goal) is the exception, for
genuinely atomic work.

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Drive PR #128 to ready" \
  --prompt "review, address feedback, and land the auth-hardening PR" \
  --goal "PR #128 is approved and merged" \
  --done-criteria "review approved, CI green, merged to master"
```

- **`--goal`** is the durable objective; **`--done-criteria`** is the explicit
  test for *done*. Both are stored on the task row and both are optional — omit
  them for a one-shot task.
- A worker treats a goal-bearing task as something to **pursue in a loop**: do one
  unit of work → record a **progress beat**
  (`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> progress <id> …`,
  which *appends* to the task's durable `progress_log`) → re-check the
  done-criteria → repeat until they are genuinely met. Dispatched **autopilot**
  bodies (`embody` / fleet seeds) run exactly this loop; the seed prompt spells it
  out (read the goal + prior `progress_log`, resume, loop, complete only on
  done-criteria).
- **Resume, don't restart.** Because the goal *and* its accumulated progress are
  durable, a worker that vanishes mid-goal is replaced by one that **resumes from
  the recorded `progress_log`** — the fabric loses only the *remainder* of the
  work, never the whole of it. This is why a progress beat is worth emitting at
  every real transition: it is the resume point.
- **Completion is self-judged but corroborated.** The worker completes the task
  **explicitly**, only once it judges the done-criteria met (**deferred
  completion**). For a goal-bearing task the coordinator corroborates the claim
  against a recorded result + progress consistent with the done-criteria before
  treating the goal as closed — a `complete` with no result and no progress toward
  a real goal is **held for attention**, not silently accepted. (A plain one-shot
  task keeps the simple deferred-completion path.)
- **What the layer does *not* do:** it makes the goal durable and resumable; it
  does **not** drive the worker's loop turn-by-turn (fire-and-forget, not driven).
  The supervisor re-embodies a *confirmed-gone* goal to resume it, and nudges an
  *alive-but-quiet* worker rather than yanking its goal away.

### Producers -- scheduled + reactive task creation

The coordinator only owns the queue; anything that *creates* tasks is a
**producer**. Two ship in-box, each driven by a declarative JSON spec:

**Quiesce and hand creation authority over with producer fences.** A managed
scope is permanently one canonical repo lane + exact task `--source`. An
optional immutable `--required-label` binds the protected pool back to that
same source: a task carrying the label cannot evade the fence through an
alternate or omitted source, and a task using the source cannot omit the
label. Label ownership is coordinator-global: no other repo+source scope may
own the same label, and tasks carrying it in another repo are rejected.
Unlabeled work under another source remains ordinary queue work, is not
eligible for the protected label pool, and is not authorized work from that
managed producer. The coordinator requires a separate
`AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN` for every transition; ordinary client auth and a
caller-asserted producer id do not grant authority. The control token is a
superset queue credential, so prefer its environment or command-fetch setting
(`AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND`) over
`--control-token`, which can expose it in process listings. A successful
transition returns a one-time high-entropy capability whose hash alone is
stored:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> producer-fence status \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget --source scheduled
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> producer-fence handoff \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget --source scheduled \
  --required-label nightly \
  --producer-id scheduler-a --expected-generation 0
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Run nightly work" \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget \
  --source scheduled --label nightly \
  --producer-id scheduler-a --producer-generation 1 \
  --producer-request-id scheduled:nightly:<occurrence> \
  --dedup-key scheduled:nightly:<occurrence>
```

`expected-generation=0` activates generation 1 on an unmanaged scope. Every
later handoff retires N permanently and activates N+1 for exactly one producer.
Managed scopes cannot be unmanaged or reopened; use a new source identity to
retire a production domain. Every managed create supplies the returned
capability (prefer `AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY_COMMAND`; the raw
`AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY` is fallback) plus a distinct
`producer_request_id`. Capability lookup is used only when the rest of
the producer fence tuple is present, so ordinary creates are unaffected by an
ambient capability. An accepted exact request retry first proves the named
generation's capability, then returns the same task after completion or
retirement; invalid or missing capability cannot retrieve it. A new request id
may use a dedup key only after ordinary terminal release has made that key
available; it never adopts another request's row. Claim defensively
revalidates protected-label task provenance, leaving legacy or malformed
injected rows unclaimable. `not_before` and `claim_as` are excluded from the
canonical request hash. A lost handoff response may be retried under control
authority for an idempotent `replayed=true` result, but no capability is
revealed again; recover by transitioning to N+2. Structured HTTP/MCP/CLI
rejections and bounded transition/create events contain no task content or
secrets.

Before activation or handoff, the coordinator proves the required-label scope
is quiescent. Any nonterminal task carrying the label without matching accepted
fence metadata returns `scope_not_quiescent` with bounded ids and status counts;
no capability is issued and no generation changes. A new managed request that
collides with any task other than its own accepted replay is rejected as
`unfenced_dedup_conflict` before request-ledger insertion. Claim-time fence
mismatches remain unclaimable and emit a bounded, fingerprinted
`producer.claim_rejected` event once per observed mismatch.

- **`agent-dispatch schedule tick <spec>`** <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow scheduler-management -->
  (and
  `schedule serve <spec>
  --interval N`) -- a scheduler/timer producer. Each tick creates one task per
  due occurrence of every schedule (`interval_seconds`, or daily `at: ["HH:MM"]`
  times), stamping `not_before` and a deterministic `dedup_key`
  (`sched:<id>:<epoch>`) so re-ticks are idempotent. Drive `tick` from cron / a
  systemd timer / `manage_schedule`, or run the built-in `serve` loop.
- **`agent-dispatch webhook --config <cfg>`** <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow webhook-management -->
  -- a reactive producer: an HTTP app
  with `POST /webhook/pr` (a **merged** PR -> follow-up task, `source=pr-webhook`,
  `origin_ref=pr/<n>`, lane from the payload's repo remote),
  `POST /webhook/telemetry` (a **firing** alert -> remediation task,
  `source=telemetry`), and `POST /webhook/issue` (a forge issue event matched
  against a list of independent, config-driven rules -> task,
  `source=issue-webhook`, `origin_ref=issue/<n>`). Deterministic `dedup_key`s
  make redelivery safe while the matching task is still non-terminal (the key
  releases once that task completes/is abandoned).
- **`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> evaluate --spec <cfg>`** -- the *evaluator*: pipe one task
  lifecycle event (stdin or `--event-file`) through a declarative rule set that
  decides what happens next (emit a follow-up task, or nothing). Hook-like; the
  judgment half of emitters-and-evaluators. `--dry-run` prints decisions only.
  For the **service-driven** loop,
  `agent-dispatch supervise --evaluator <cfg>` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow supervisor-management -->
  runs the same rules each cycle over newly-concluded tasks (advancing the loop
  with no bespoke module; idempotent via the emit's `dedup_key`).

See the plugin README (**Producers**) for the spec/config shapes.

### Recipes -- kick a built-in loop archetype ad-hoc

A **recipe** is a packaged *shape* of long-running work -- **reviewer** (drive a
PR to merged-or-abandoned), **conflict-resolution** (unstick a stalled change), or
**goal-driven** (drive an arbitrary goal through PRs). A recipe is directly
kickable: no standing service, emitter, or evaluator is required -- just a
coordinator + a worker body.

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recipes list                                   # available recipes + params
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recipes render reviewer --param repo=o/n --param pr=42   # inspect the fields
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recipes kick reviewer --param repo=o/n --param pr=42 --repo o/n --spawn
```

`kick` reuses `create` (lane resolution, dedup, `--spawn`/`--spawn-backend`;
default `embody` so the worker gets a full checkout). A reserved-work `dedup_key`
is derived from the recipe + params, so re-kicking the same target collides rather
than forking. Use `--dry-run` to preview the create call. See the plugin README
(**Recipes**) and `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch` (§*The recipe*).

**Route a kicked loop onto a supervisor pool with `--label`.** `kick` accepts a
repeatable `--label` (merged after, and de-duplicated with, the recipe's own
labels). This is how you feed a **standing, label-gated supervisor pool** instead
of spawning a one-off body: enqueue the kicked task under the pool's opt-in label
and let a pool slot claim it -- no `--spawn` needed.

```bash
# a persistent pool watches one label, e.g. AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_LABELS=general
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recipes kick goal-driven \
  --param goal="fix the flaky retry in the uploader" --param repos=o/n \
  --label general        # a 'general'-pool slot claims + drives it to a PR
```

Because a label-gated supervisor claims **only** tasks carrying its label, a pool
scoped to a dedicated label (`general`) is a clean **positive opt-in**: it never
picks up system tasks that carry their own labels (reviews, scheduled sweeps).

**Driving the loop** --
`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> recipes drive <name> --signal <s>` maps a
recipe + what-just-happened to the next action: **work** (start / a `suspend_on`
event), **suspend** (`work-done`/`idle` -> hibernate the wait), or **resolve**
(`merged`/`abandoned` -> drive-to-resolution). `--execute` runs the suspend leg
(`--resume <wt> -- <wait-cmd>`, spawns the detached waiter) and the resolve leg
(`--base <b>`, runs the unwind); **work** stays the agent's to perform. This is
the seam that composes recipes + `run` + `resolve` into an executable loop.

### Resolve -- drive your worktree to a clean state when a loop ends

When a loop finishes, drive the worktree to its resolved final state -- landing
verifies clean; abandoning **unwinds to base** and reconciles the source. Run it
on your **own** worktree:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> resolve --outcome landed                                  # verify clean
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> resolve --outcome abandoned --base main --source o/n#42   # preview the unwind
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> resolve --outcome abandoned --base main --execute         # perform it (destructive)
```

Planning is pure and prints by default; `--execute` performs the (destructive)
unwind and a failed reset stops rather than pressing on.
`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> abandon --resolve` surfaces the same plan
alongside the abandon. See the plugin README
(**Drive the worktree to resolution**) and `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`
(§*drive-the-worktree-to-resolution*).

### Hibernate the wait -- hand a blocking wait to the layer

When a loop can only wait on a slow external condition, don't sit on a live
session. Hand the wait to `run`: it executes the blocking command and, when it
resolves, resumes the worktree-affinitied worker via an agent-bridge nudge. A
repeated-timeout (nothing ever changes) backstop caps how long it re-arms in
place before giving up and resuming anyway with an explicit "never resolved"
message -- see the plugin README (**Hibernate the wait**).

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> run --resume <machine/worktree> --task <id> -- agent-worktrees pr-watch 42 # marketplace-isolation: allow agent-worktrees-management
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> run --detach --resume <machine/worktree> -- agent-worktrees pr-watch 42 # marketplace-isolation: allow agent-worktrees-management
```

Everything after `--` is the wait command. `--detach` runs it as a fully detached,
cheap OS-level waiter (no agent, no tokens) so the expensive worker session can be
torn down while it waits, then re-woken with its context intact. See the plugin
README (**Hibernate the wait**) and `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`
(§*hibernate-the-wait*).

### 3. Claim, work, finish

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> claim --capability logger     # atomically leases one eligible task
# note the returned task id + owner, then:
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> start    <id> <owner>
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> heartbeat <id> <owner>        # optional: refresh the last-seen beat
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> complete <id> <owner> --result-ref artifact/123
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> complete <id> <owner> --result-file result.json
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> result <id> [--raw]
```

Completion may record an optional JSON object/array result with
`--result-json` or the cross-platform-friendly `--result-file` (`-` reads
stdin; one leading UTF-8 BOM is accepted on every input path). The canonical
UTF-8 encoding is capped at 64 KiB and is committed atomically with
`status=submitted`, `result_ref`, and the stable completing identity; invalid
input is HTTP 400, oversized input is HTTP 413, and both leave the task
non-terminal. JSON null and scalars are rejected. MCP callers should pass a
decoded object or array; the MCP SDK may normalize a JSON-encoded object string.
`show` retains the full decoded value; bulk `list`/`find`/`sweep`/`inbox` rows
expose only `has_result`. Retrieve the value with `result <id>`,
`GET /tasks/<id>/result`, or `dispatch_result`. SSE events likewise carry only
`has_result`: initial completion emits `task.submitted`, retry-fill emits
`task.result_recorded`, and an identical retry emits no duplicate event.

A client sending a structured result verifies that the coordinator returned the
recorded value and raises an upgrade-required error if an older coordinator
silently ignored it. After upgrading, the same completing owner may retry to
fill a missing result or repeat the identical value; conflicting values and
different owners cannot overwrite it. Omitting it preserves the existing
lifecycle and `result_ref` behavior.

For MCP `dispatch_complete`, omit the `result` argument to complete without a
structured result; explicit JSON null is invalid.

Report progress toward the goal so callers/operator watch the fleet at a glance
(this also refreshes the last-seen beat):

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> progress <id> --phase implementing --summary "wired the verb; tests green"
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> progress <id> --phase "PR open" --summary "opened the PR" --pr pr/2601
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> progress <id> --summary "stuck on a flaky test" --blocker "CI timeout"
```

Set **this worktree's current focus** (for an operator or task-less worktree —
the cockpit shows what each worktree is working on). Post it when you *start
substantial work* and *change direction*, never on a timer:

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> focus "driving live-session-messaging Phase 8 (multi-machine dispatch)"
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> focus            # show this worktree's current focus
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> focus --list     # every worktree's focus (this machine)
```

Recoverable snag -> return it for a later cycle (keep the note!):

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> yield <id> <owner> --note "blocked on merge conflict; retry next cycle"
```

Discard a duplicate / dropped task (needs permission):

```bash
# a duplicate is self-justifying -- --duplicate-of implies permission and
# records the dedup reference in the audit trail (never a silent drop):
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> abandon <id> --duplicate-of pr/123     # or task-id / issue ref
# any other discard still asserts permission explicitly:
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> abandon <id> --worker-id <owner> --permit --reason "dropped priority"
```

### Evaluate before committing (the contract-net window)

`claim` and `start` are **two steps on purpose** — between them is an
**evaluation window** where you hold the task exclusively but haven't committed
to running it. `claim --evaluation` marks the window as an *evaluation* (a
worker signals "assessing, not yet committed"). The row carries lease timestamps
for heartbeats/observability, but recovery is **not** driven by elapsed time:
an evaluator is reclaimed only if its worker is confirmed gone (liveness GC), and
`start` commits the task to `started` while capturing the owner session id when
available.

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> claim --task <id> --evaluation    # win a short exclusive eval window
# ...assess: dup-check (<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> list / sweep), feasibility, is-this-for-me...
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> start   <id>                      # ACCEPT -> commit to doing the work
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> yield   <id> --exclude-self worktree --note "not my capability"  # DECLINE
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> abandon <id> --duplicate-of <ref>                                # DUPLICATE
```

Three ways out of the window: **accept** (`start`), **decline** (`yield
--exclude-self` — returns it and appends a scoped "not me" so you aren't
re-offered it), or **retire** (`abandon --duplicate-of` for a duplicate/obsolete
task). Dispatched **autopilot** workers (`embody`/fleet seeds) run exactly this
loop. Default the decline scope to the **narrowest** true one (`worktree`); widen
to `machine` only when the mismatch is machine-wide.

### Inspect

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> show    <id>       # full task record
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> events  <id>       # append-only audit trail of every transition
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> payload <id>       # resolved payload (inline or blob); --raw prints content only
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> consume <id>       # resume-and-consume: drive to submitted (idempotent) + print payload
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> consume <id> --defer-complete  # TAKEOVER pickup: approve->claim->start + print brief, NO complete
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> watch              # stream task.* events (SSE) as JSON lines
```

## Routing: `requires` (hard) vs `affinity` (soft)

- **`requires`** (repeatable `--require`) -- capability tokens (`logger`,
  `review`, `merge`) or identity tokens (`machine:<m>`, `worktree:<w>`,
  `repo:<lane>`, `agent:review-bot`). A task is claimable only when `requires`
  is a **subset** of the worker's advertised token set. Two machines advertising
  the same capability give
  **cooperative, redundant** coverage: first writer wins; if one worker goes
  away, a liveness GC pass requeues its task and the other reclaims it -- no
  leader election.
- **`affinity`** (repeatable `--affinity key=value`) -- soft *preferences*
  (preferred agent/worktree) that order candidates but **never exclude**.
- **`exclusive_key`** (`--exclusive-key`) -- hard spawn singleton for one logical
  resource across several task ids. It prevents two active spawn reservations
  from existing for that resource and carries the previous worktree as the next
  spawn's reuse target.
- A **hard pin** is just a target promoted into `requires`; `detach <id>` demotes
  a hard worktree pin to a soft affinity (e.g. once local work is pushed, a bound
  handoff becomes portable).

## Spawning a worker: headless (bridge) vs CLI-backed autopilot (embody)

`create --spawn` spawns a worker that claims and executes the task by id. A
**spawn backend** chooses *how* the worker is embodied:

```bash
# Headless agent-bridge ACP worker (default backend)
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Summarize the PR" --require review --spawn              # managed (waits)
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Summarize the PR" --spawn --spawn-agent task-worker --async  # fire-and-forget

# CLI-backed AUTOPILOT session -- "dispatch an agent to do X"
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Refactor the auth module" \
  --prompt "extract JWT handling into src/auth/ …" \
  --spawn --spawn-backend embody
```

- **`--spawn-backend bridge`** (default) -- a **headless** agent-bridge ACP
  worker. Ephemeral; torn down with its caller.
- **`--spawn-backend embody`** -- a **durable, CLI-backed autopilot** session in
  a **fresh parallel worktree on the same machine**, via `agent-worktrees embody
  --new` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow agent-worktrees-management -->
  (launched with `--allow-all --experimental` so prompts stay auto-approved and
  any installed SDK extension can actually load, stamped `--driver
  agent-dispatch` so it's viewable in Neuron Forge with a "driven by" banner).
  This is the **"dispatch an agent to do X"** path: the embodied session claims →
  starts → works the task autonomously → and **completes it explicitly** only
  when it judges the goal reached (**deferred completion** -- the task's
  `submitted` state means the *work is done*, not that a baton was handed over).

**Same body choice in the supervisor, keyed by label.** A persistent
`agent-dispatch supervise` loop <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow supervisor-management -->
is **headless by default**, but can route labels to two other bodies:

- `--cli-label L` -> a durable **CLI autopilot** (`embody`) worktree session.
- `--script-label L` -> a plain deterministic **script subprocess** that never
  invokes an LLM.

The headless body still reuses the **same autopilot seed** as the CLI backend,
so a headless-embodied task is *driven* identically; only its body differs. The
script body is deliberately non-agentic: it drives claim/start/progress/
complete/abandon through the ordinary lifecycle client surface instead of a live
Copilot session. Service knobs mirror the flags in `supervisor.env`. See the
design doc's "Per-label embody body" section.

**Script payload contract.** A script-embodied task carries a JSON
`payload_inline` describing what to launch:

- `{"path":"C:\\absolute\\worker.py","args":["..."],"env":{"K":"V"}}`
  runs the file with agent-dispatch's own runtime Python.
- `{"argv":["some-exe","arg1","arg2"],"cwd":"C:\\absolute\\dir","env":{"K":"V"}}`
  runs the exact argv directly.

`agent_dispatch.script_worker.ScriptTaskRuntime` is the helper contract for such
bodies. It reads supervisor-injected task/coordinator context from environment
variables, wraps claim/start/heartbeat/progress/complete/abandon, and treats a
return without an explicit terminal call as a protocol violation.

**Fleet mode (`--pool`) is fleet-wide, not per-label.** When the supervisor fans
bodies out across a **pool of remote hosts** (`--pool a,b [--origin <alias>]`), the
body choice is a single fleet-wide switch: default CLI/mux embody on the pool
host, or `--headless` (with `--headless-agent`) to embody **every** fleet body as
a headless agent-bridge ACP session there instead -- the reliable remote
embodiment (a kicked CLI/mux body can hit the "Loading…" startup-seed hang and
never claim). `--headless-label` is ignored in fleet mode. See the design doc's
"Headless-fleet body" section.

**Persistent supervisor profiles.** The installer manages a primary supervisor
from `~/.agent-dispatch/supervisor.env` plus named profiles in <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
`~/.agent-dispatch/supervisors/<name>.env` (safe names: letters, digits, `_`, <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
`-`). Each profile uses the same `AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_*` schema and becomes
its own `agent-dispatch-supervisor-<name>` unit/task; `status`/`start`/`stop` and
`uninstall` iterate them, deleted env files remove orphaned profiles, and
`--no-supervisor` / client-only installs remove all supervisors. To run a fleet
headless supervisor persistently, put the watched labels in
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_LABELS`, set any bridge agent with
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_HEADLESS_AGENT`, and put
`--pool a,b --origin <alias> --headless` in
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_EXTRA_ARGS`. See `docs/spawn-supervisor.md` for depth.

Both backends **degrade gracefully**: if the chosen mechanism isn't on PATH
(no `agent-worktrees` for `embody`, no `agent-bridge` for `bridge`) the embody
backend falls back to bridge, and if neither is present the task is simply left
queued for any worker to claim. agent-dispatch stays fully usable standalone.

## MCP tools instead of the CLI

`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> mcp` runs a local **stdio MCP server** exposing the same
operations as tools (`dispatch_create`, `dispatch_find`, `dispatch_sweep`,
`dispatch_producer_scope_status`, `dispatch_producer_scope_handoff`,
`dispatch_claim`, `dispatch_start`, `dispatch_complete`, `dispatch_payload`,
`dispatch_result`,
`dispatch_worktree_status`, ...). It resolves your `machine`/`worktree` identity
from the working directory just like the CLI, so `dispatch_claim` /
`dispatch_worktree_status` are auto-scoped with no arguments when the CWD
resolves both identity and repo. Point a sub-agent's
`.mcp.json` at
`{"command": "agent-dispatch", "args": ["mcp"]}` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow mcp-server-startup -->
(needs the `mcp` extra). The coordinator also hosts the **same tools over HTTP at `/mcp`** for
remote clients that supply identity and lane via
`X-Agent-Machine`/`X-Agent-Worktree`/`X-Agent-Repo` headers. The CLI and MCP
tools are interchangeable — use whichever fits.
`dispatch_complete` accepts an optional JSON object/array `result` argument and
returns it in the completed task record; `dispatch_result` retrieves it later.

## Config quick reference

| Env var | Role |
|---------|------|
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` | coordinator base URL the CLI talks to (point at a remote host) |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` | ordinary bearer token (client sends, server validates) |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND` | superset queue bearer required to activate/transition managed producer scopes (and to register evaluators); prefer env/command over argv |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY_COMMAND` | preferred command that prints the current producer capability on demand |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY` | raw fallback capability for one selected producer generation's managed creates; applied only with the rest of the fence tuple |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_URL` | shared/elected coordinator endpoint for cross-machine dispatch (the hosted coordinator); used only with `--shared` |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN` | bearer for the shared coordinator (independent of `AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN`) |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN` | managed-producer control bearer for the shared coordinator |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN_COMMAND` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND` | command-backed shared credentials that avoid argv exposure |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_HOST` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_PORT` | where the coordinator binds (server side) |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_DB` | SQLite queue file (server side) |
| `AGENT_DISPATCH_GC_INTERVAL` | liveness garbage-collection cadence in seconds (server side; `0` disables). `AGENT_DISPATCH_SWEEP_INTERVAL` is a deprecated alias. |

All CLI output is JSON on stdout, so verbs compose with `jq` and other tooling.
Global flags `--url` / `--token` / `--control-token` override the env per
invocation; `--shared`
routes the command at the shared/elected coordinator instead of the local one.
Bearer scheme matching is case-insensitive. Prefer env or token-command
configuration to token flags where process arguments may be observable.

## Gotchas

- **Most reads are lane-scoped.** By default `list`/`find`/`sweep` show **your
  repo's** tasks. An "empty" sweep or "no claimable task" may just mean *your
  lane* is empty. Use `--repo <name>` to look at a specific other lane; use
  `inbox` for the intentional machine-scoped cross-lane picker view.
- **Lane != code target.** `--repo` is the owning lane (defaults to the calling
  repo). `--target-repo` is the cross-repo *code* a task touches -- the task
  still lives in the producing lane and a same-lane agent does the work via
  `working-cross-repo`. Don't file a task into another repo's lane to "send" it
  there.
- **Check `health` first.** Every non-`serve` verb needs a reachable coordinator;
  a failing claim usually means the URL is wrong or the daemon is down, not that
  the queue is empty (`claim` exits non-zero with "no claimable task" when the
  queue simply has nothing for you).
- **Dedup before create.** `sweep` (then explore/verify) is the primary check;
  `find` is a quick probe; rely on `--dedup-key` as the backstop, not the first
  line of defense. Write self-contained titles/prompts so the sweep can work.
- **Explain suspension and yield.** `suspend` requires a meaningful `--reason`;
  `started -> queued` is only useful to the next agent
  if you say *why* you yielded. A bare suspend always attaches a default
  **cooldown monitor** and auto-resumes once it elapses (round-robin
  time-slicing, not an unwatched idle) -- override with `--cooldown-seconds`,
  or `--no-cooldown` only when you've arranged your own, more specific wait.
- **Don't fake identity.** Let `claim` / `worktree-status` resolve it from CWD;
  only pass `--machine` / `--worktree` to override or where agent-worktrees is
  absent.
For a standing repository issue backlog, prefer one source-controlled
`kind: repository-issue-loop` declaration over a custom schedule plus worker
script. It expands to the stock periodic emitter and a concurrency-one headless
lane, selects quiet label-eligible issues deterministically, visibly reserves
them on the forge, and emits one exclusive goal task for the bounded batch.
Overlapping declarations also compete for one coordinator-atomic
repository/issue reservation, so exactly one loop wins before task creation;
the loser visibly releases its provisional forge marker.
Declare the expected `forge.producer_login`; the runtime verifies the
repository-scoped authenticated identity and ignores marker-shaped comments
from every other author.

```bash
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> repository-issue-loop discover \
  .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> repository-issue-loop doctor \
  .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
```

Use `setup|inspect|status|doctor|disable|enable` for lifecycle controls.
`discover` is the safe dry run. Do not hand-clear another loop's reservation;
steer, release, or abandon a blocked dispatch task explicitly. During host
migration, disable the old declaration, release or hand off its emitter lease,
then transfer declaration placement/producer authority before enabling the new
host. See the plugin README and `docs/repository-issue-loop.md`. Adopting a
new declaration from scratch? Start with
`docs/repository-issue-loop-adoption.md` (schema reference, worker identity
library, worked example) instead.
