"""The **fenced-epoch coordinator lease** -- agent-dispatch federation's standby
failover, layered on top of the Phase-1 rendezvous seam.

Federation funnels the claim plane through a **single coordinator**: peers pull
work through whichever coordinator the directory advertises, so nothing is
double-claimed. This module makes that coordinator *survive its host failing*
without a leader election -- single-user federation has no Byzantine actors, so
crash/partition tolerance plus dedup suffice (see the
``agent-dispatch-federation`` effort and
``visions/agent-fabric/agent-dispatch`` §Behaviors/*coordinator-is-discovered-not-
elected* + *peers-discover-and-federate*).

Two halves of one mechanism, both **backing-agnostic** (they speak only the
:class:`~agent_dispatch.federation.Rendezvous` Protocol, never a concrete queue,
so the hosted-coordinator (Phase 3) and Dev Tunnels (Phase 4) backends drive the *same* code):

* :class:`CoordinatorLease` -- the write-side state machine. A periodic
  :meth:`~CoordinatorLease.tick` renews our own lease, stands by behind a healthy
  peer coordinator, or -- when the active one is stale or gone -- **takes over**
  with the *next* monotonic epoch. The epoch is a **fencing token**: bumping it on
  takeover fences the deposed writer.
* :class:`FencingGuard` -- the authority-side check. A directive presented below
  the current coordinator epoch is the deposed writer's late write and is
  **rejected** (:class:`FencedError`).

This module deliberately holds no transport keepalive/backoff (Phase 4) and no
server-side wiring of the guard onto claim/write endpoints -- there is no shared
external directory in the coordinator-hosted/local backend, so that enforcement
lands with the hosted-coordinator / Dev Tunnels backends where a real multi-coordinator
directory exists. Phase 2 lays only the lease + fence *mechanism*.

.. note::
   A single :class:`CoordinatorLease` is meant to be driven from **one** loop
   (the instance's supervisor tick); it is not internally locked. The directory
   it talks to *is* concurrency-safe -- the lease's single-winner guarantee on a
   simultaneous takeover comes from the directory's total order (see
   :meth:`CoordinatorLease._take_over`), not from local locking.

    * **Renew** -- the discovered coordinator *is us*: refresh our entry at the held
      epoch (re-asserting it if a tight reap race expired it between beats).
    * **Stand by** -- a *different*, still-fresh coordinator holds the role

    fail independently -- e.g. Dev Tunnels' ``list`` vs. ``show``/``update`` -- and
    silently dropping our own heartbeat over a read-only outage would hand a
    healthy standby an undeserved takeover), while a **standby** always propagates
    the failure rather than risk promoting itself without having actually
    confirmed the real coordinator is gone.
