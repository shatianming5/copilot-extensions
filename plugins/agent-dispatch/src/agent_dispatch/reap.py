"""Reap superseded coordinator processes (single-active-coordinator invariant).

A graceful coordinator cutover (``zdd`` ``CutoverOrchestrator``) retires only the
*one* predecessor it replaces -- it sends ``old_client.shutdown()`` to the daemon
whose route it just took over. It does **not** reconcile the *full set* of live
coordinators. Across repeated updates and restarts that gap leaks processes:

- a cutover spawns its replacement as a **detached** ``serve --passive`` process;
  once *that* is superseded by a *later* cutover whose predecessor is a
  **different** process (e.g. a plain ``serve`` restart that re-published the
  routing table over the top), the earlier detached passive is never anyone's
  "old" and so is never sent ``/shutdown``;
- a plain (non-cutover) ``serve`` restart re-publishes routing to itself but does
  not retire the coordinator it displaced.

Each straggler keeps a bound port and tens of MB of RSS, indefinitely, until a
human cleans up. This module closes the gap: given the authoritative active
coordinator (the ``active`` entry of the routing table), it terminates every
*other* live coordinator process.

Design:

- **Pure core, IO at the edges.** :func:`is_coordinator_cmdline` and
  :func:`select_superseded_pids` are pure and unit-tested; enumeration and
  termination are thin, injectable seams.
- **Precise matching.** Only the coordinator (``agent_dispatch serve``) is
  matched -- never the supervisor (``agent_dispatch supervise serve``), the
  scheduler (``agent_dispatch schedule serve``), a worker, or the ``_cutover``
  helper itself. The subcommand token immediately after ``agent_dispatch`` /
  ``agent-dispatch`` must be exactly ``serve``.
- **Fail-soft.** Enumeration or termination failures are logged and swallowed;
  the reaper never raises into its caller (the queue must never fail to serve
  because a stray could not be reaped). It also refuses to act when it cannot
  anchor on an active pid, so it can never terminate the *only* coordinator.
