"""SQLite-backed leased task queue -- the agent-dispatch engine.

A single-writer, WAL-mode SQLite queue providing an **atomic leased claim** over
a set of *tasks*. This module is deliberately transport-free: it is a pure
library that the coordinator process wraps behind HTTP. Everything that must be
*correct under concurrency* lives here, patterned on a proven single-writer
leased-queue design.
Design notes
------------
* **Nine-state model** (see :class:`Status`):
  ``proposed -> queued -> claimed -> started -> submitted -> completed`` plus
  dormant ``suspended`` and terminal ``abandoned`` / ``dead_letter``.
  ``proposed`` and ``suspended`` are never claimable; liveness recovery returns
  only actively held tasks to ``queued``.
* **Capability-gated claim.** A task carries a hard ``requires`` set (capability
  tokens or an ``agent:<id>`` identity pin); a worker advertises a capability
  set at claim time. A task is claimable only when ``requires`` is a subset of
  the worker's capabilities. ``affinity`` is a soft preference that orders
  candidates but never excludes.
* **Cooperative claiming = redundancy.** ``claim_one`` takes a write lock
  (``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``) and re-checks ``status='queued'`` before committing, so
  N capable workers racing for one task yield exactly one winner. A dead worker's
  lease expires and any other capable worker reclaims it -- no leader election.
* **Additive migrations.** ``_migrate`` runs ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` plus
  idempotent ``ALTER TABLE`` column adds, so an existing DB upgrades safely (a
  bare ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` never upgrades an existing table).
