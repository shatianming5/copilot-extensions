"""SQLite-backed leased task queue -- the agent-dispatch engine.

A single-writer, WAL-mode SQLite queue providing an **atomic leased claim** over
a set of *tasks*. This module is deliberately transport-free: it is a pure
library that the coordinator process wraps behind HTTP. Everything that must be
*correct under concurrency* lives here, patterned on a proven single-writer
leased-queue design.

Design notes
------------
* **Eight-state model** (see :class:`Status`):
  ``proposed -> queued -> claimed -> started -> completed`` plus dormant
  ``suspended`` and terminal ``abandoned`` / ``dead_letter``. ``proposed`` and
  ``suspended`` are never claimable; liveness recovery returns only actively
  held tasks to ``queued``.
* **Capability-gated claim.** A task carries a hard ``requires`` set (capability
  tokens or an ``agent:<id>`` identity pin); a worker advertises a capability
  set at claim time. A task is claimable only when ``requires`` is a subset of
  the worker's capabilities. ``affinity`` is a soft preference that orders
  candidates but never excludes.
* **Cooperative claiming = redundancy.** ``claim_one`` takes a write lock
  (``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``) and re-checks ``status='queued'`` before committing, so
  N capable workers racing for one task yield exactly one winner. A dead worker's
  lease expires and any other capable worker reclaims it -- no leader election.
* **Additive migrations.** ``_migrate`` runs ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` plus
  idempotent ``ALTER TABLE`` column adds, so an existing DB upgrades safely (a
  bare ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` never upgrades an existing table).

        so a consumer only sees/claims work for its own repo. (A cross-repo
        *code* target is separate metadata, ``target_repo``; the lane agent does
        that work via ``working-cross-repo``, never by launching another repo's

        singleton across head-specific or otherwise episode-specific tasks. When
        ``supersede_exclusive_key`` is true, older queued/proposed tasks with the
        same key are abandoned in the same transaction as the new insert. Held
        tasks are never yanked; the spawn reservation for the key prevents a
        second live worker while the incumbent finishes or yields.

        ``claim_as`` makes this an **atomic create-and-claim**: a brand-new task
        is inserted already ``claimed`` by that owner in the *same* transaction,
        so there is no queued-and-unclaimed gap for another worker to race into.
        On a ``dedup_key`` collision the existing task is returned **as-is**
        (never re-claimed) -- so a caller can tell it lost the race by seeing the
        returned task's ``owner`` is not itself. This is the lazy-carve
        open-ended-pickup primitive: ``create(dedup_key=<subject>, claim_as=me)``

        :meth:`reconcile_liveness` only recovers *owned* held tasks against their
        owner's session liveness; an **unowned** proposed/queued task has no owner,
        so nothing ever reaps it -- pinned (``--target-worktree``) to a worktree
        that was later pruned, it lingers forever. That is the context-handoff
        leak: a stored handoff whose live-cutover never completed (or a fallback
        the operator never resumed) accumulates one dead task per session. This
        closes it.

        ``live_worktrees`` is the set of worktree ids currently **live** on
        ``machine`` (e.g. ``agent-worktrees list --tracking-status active``). A
        task is reaped iff ALL hold:

        - status is ``proposed`` or ``queued`` (unowned -- no worker holds it);
        - ``target_machine`` case-insensitively equals ``machine`` (we only judge
          against a live-worktree set we actually have -- a task targeting another
          machine is that coordinator's to reap);
        - ``target_worktree`` is set and **not** in ``live_worktrees``;
        - it is older than ``grace_secs`` (a just-created handoff whose successor
          hasn't started yet is never reaped -- mirrors the liveness GC's refusal
          to act on a claim/register race).

        **Degrade safe:** ``live_worktrees is None`` (the caller's probe failed)
        reaps nothing -- never act on ignorance, exactly like the ``unknown``
        liveness verdict. **Fenced:** each abandon is conditional on ``(id,
        status, generation)``, so a task claimed/consumed between the read and the
