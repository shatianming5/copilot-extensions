"""In-process event bus for coordinator SSE fan-out.

Coordinator mutations run in synchronous route handlers (worker threads), while
SSE subscribers live on the event loop. :meth:`EventBus.publish` is therefore
thread-safe: it hops back onto the bound loop before touching subscriber queues.
A slow subscriber drops events rather than back-pressuring producers.
