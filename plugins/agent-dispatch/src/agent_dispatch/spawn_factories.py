"""Default spawn/liveness/conclusion callables and embody-backend factories.

Split out of :mod:`agent_dispatch.supervisor` (see that module's own docstring

**stateless**: every function here is a pure default or a factory that closes
over only its own arguments -- none of it touches :class:`Supervisor` instance
state. That is what makes it a safe, low-risk extraction: nothing here is
monkeypatched via ``self``, and every name is re-exported unchanged from
``supervisor.py`` so existing call sites and tests (which patch

    This is the embodiment for **self-contained, bounded** tasks that need no
    human attach: a scheduled/reactive sweep that claims a task, runs it to a
    deliberate completion, and is torn down. It sidesteps the CLI-start-prompt
    delivery path entirely (a seeded CLI session can race the input caret and
    never deliver its seed), so a headless-marked task never deadlocks on that
    path. ``charter`` optionally overlays a ``.agent.md`` persona.

    It reuses the **same autopilot seed** as the CLI backend
    (:func:`agent_dispatch.embody.autopilot_worker_prompt` -- claim-under-identity,
    contract-net evaluation, deferred completion), so a headless-embodied task is
    driven identically to a CLI-embodied one; only the *body* differs. Degrades
    cleanly: if the ``agent-bridge`` CLI is absent, the spawn reports failure (the
    supervisor fails the reservation, leaving the task queued).

    The supervisor pre-creates and records the headless body's worktree before
    launch, then passes that exact target to agent-bridge. It also records a
    ``local-body:<bridge-session-id>`` recovery handle, so a
    body that ends before completing (crash, or an explicit ``agent-bridge end``
    after a run cancel) is **liveness-recovered**: the supervisor probes the
    session locally and, on a confirmed-gone verdict, settles the orphaned
    ``spawned`` reservation -- freeing the label's concurrency slot instead of
    starving it. Reconciliation still settles the reservation when the task
    reaches a terminal state.
