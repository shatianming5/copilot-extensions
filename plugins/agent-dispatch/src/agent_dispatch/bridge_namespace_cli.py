"""``dispatch:`` namespace-provider CLI commands for agent-bridge (#3389).

Fixes the upward `agent-bridge` -> `agent-dispatch` dependency the
`a-la-carte-independence` plugin-stack layering rule forbids: agent-bridge
used to import an `agent_dispatch_client.py` HTTP client and call the
coordinator directly (`resolve_dispatch_url()`/`fetch_task`/
`fetch_attachments`). Now agent-dispatch is the one that knows how to reach
its own coordinator -- it registers a `dispatch` namespace-provider manifest
into agent-bridge's `providers.d` registry (the same provider-manifest
sub-pattern already proven for agent-codespaces/agent-containers) and
exposes these two commands over the process-boundary contract agent-bridge
already drives every other provider through (`namespace-list`/
`namespace-resolve`, exit 3 = not-found, exit 4 = bad-state).

``namespace-resolve <task_id>`` answers "which worktree is this task bound
to" using the exact same claimant logic ``task_lifecycle_cli._cmd_claimant``
already exposes as a CLI verb, but returns agent-bridge's `type: "worktree"`
namespace-resolve contract (see `agent_bridge.agent_registry_namespace`)
instead of a raw spawn_command -- agent-dispatch only needs to name *which*
worktree a task is bound to; agent-bridge's own already-correct worktree
transport resolution (SSH topology, `agent-worktrees resolve`, etc.) builds
the rest. The task's raw record + durable attachment history are carried
through as opaque `venue` passthrough data (`venue["task"]`/
`venue["attachments"]`) so agent-bridge's own `dispatch_task_resolution
.candidate_session_ids()` ranking -- deliberately pure and agent-bridge-
owned -- keeps working unchanged, just fed from this process boundary
instead of a direct HTTP fetch.

Scope (2026-09-23, `agent-fabric-endpoint-discovery` Phase 2.5a, extended
same day): a task bound to a worktree (claimed, started, or pinned via
``target_worktree``) resolves `type: "worktree"`. A task with no worktree
binding at all -- the normal, permanent state for a completed *headless*
body (a board-sweep/review worker never binds a worktree; its `owner`
clears to `None` on completion) -- falls back to `type: "session"` when the
task's own `owner_session_id` (or an attachment's `session_id`) is durably
recorded, carrying the same `task`/`attachments` venue payload for the
caller's own *resolve-by-any-origin-reference* ranking
(`agent_bridge.dispatch_task_resolution.candidate_session_ids`). A truly
unassigned task with no worktree binding AND no recorded session at all,
or a task bound to a *different* machine's coordinator (cross-machine
dispatch), is still bad-state (exit 4) -- real claim-on-resolve for a
never-started task and cross-machine reach remain explicitly out of scope
here (see Phase 2.5b/c in the effort README), not silently guessed at.
