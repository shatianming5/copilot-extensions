"""agent-dispatch doctor (Boundary I / ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2577):
distinguish a genuinely *orphaned* held/suspended task from ordinary in-flight
work or merely ambiguous liveness, and offer one narrowly-scoped, explicit
repair.

Background: ``agent-dispatch health``'s ``liveness_gc`` loop already
classifies every held task's liveness, but a hibernating task (suspended,
its session deliberately torn down while a detached waiter blocks on some
external event -- see :mod:`agent_dispatch.hibernation`) is *correctly*
ambiguous there: an absent live session is the intended, healthy state of
that pattern, not evidence of death. The only signal strong enough to know a
hibernating task can *never* self-resolve is that its expected worktree is
now provably gone -- reclaimed by agent-worktrees, e.g. by the exact
finalize-vs-suspended-task race #2584 fixes going forward, or by any other
means (a manual ``rm``, an operator ``cleanup``). This module checks for
*that* specific, confirmed condition and, only there, offers to unbind the
task and return it to ``queued`` so a fresh attempt can proceed.

Every other case -- a merely stale lease, an indeterminate agent-worktrees
lookup, a task with no reservation to check -- is surfaced for visibility
but never auto-repaired. This mirrors the design constraint from #2577's
discussion: never re-create/re-queue on a guess, only on confirmed
deletion, and never race a second attempt against one still legitimately
in flight.

**Reservation-history liveness (ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2884):** the
coordinator only ever attaches a task's *latest* spawn reservation (see
``coordinator.py``'s ``result["spawn_reservation"] = asdict(latest)``), so
the checks above -- like an operator reading ``owner``/``owner_session_id``
by hand -- only ever see the most recent attempt. A *later* attempt can die
while an *earlier* attempt's session is still alive and fully resumable, and
nothing re-checks that earlier attempt once a newer reservation shadows it.
``diagnose`` optionally accepts that task's full reservation history
(``DispatchClient.list_reservations(task_id=...)``) and, when given, checks
every attempt's actual embody-session liveness **by session id** (not the
task's ``owner`` worker_id/lane label, which reflects only the latest
attempt) before falling through to the worktree/lease checks above. Finding
a live earlier attempt is the single highest-priority verdict this module
reports, since it is both the most actionable ("resume that session") and
the one existing tooling was structurally blind to.

    """Find ``queued`` tasks whose latest spawn reservation genuinely
    ``FAILED`` -- the class of stuck task :func:`diagnose`'s bounded
    repo/label sweep structurally cannot see, since ``EXAMINED_STATUSES``
    deliberately excludes ``queued`` (a large backlog would otherwise
    consume the sweep's own ``limit`` before any claimed/started/suspended
    row is examined).

    This queries
    ``GET /spawn-reservations?state=failed&task_status=queued&latest_only=true``
    directly -- a **separate**, reservation-state-filtered, independently-
    limited query that never competes with the task sweep's own budget.
    Two server-side filters keep the whole bounded ``limit`` spent on
    actual candidates: ``latest_only`` restricts the result to each task's
    single highest-attempt reservation row (without it, a retried task's
    older, already-superseded failed attempts could crowd the limit), and
    ``task_status="queued"`` excludes a non-queued task's current ``FAILED``
    reservation (a completed/abandoned/dead-lettered task's last failed
    attempt is not interesting here, but would otherwise consume the same
    budget ahead of an actually-still-queued task further back in the
    newest-first ordering). For each matching reservation it fetches the
    owning task (``GET /tasks/{id}``, the one endpoint that actually
    attaches ``spawn_reservation`` -- the bulk ``GET /tasks`` list endpoint
    does not, which is why this cannot simply filter an already-fetched
    task list) and reports it only when that task is still ``queued``
    **and** this is still its *current* (latest) reservation -- a defense-
    in-depth re-check in case a fresh attempt was reserved between the two
    queries above. The fetched reservation's own ``state`` is re-checked
    too (still required to be ``FAILED``), since an operator's
    ``reservations rearm`` can race in the same window -- same key, same
    queued task, but the state moved on (``failed`` -> ``rearmed``) and it
    is no longer stuck.
