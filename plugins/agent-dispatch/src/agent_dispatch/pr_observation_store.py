"""Persistent per-(repo, PR) observation store for reviewer-side provider adapters.

Phase 10 item 3's remaining slice: :mod:`agent_dispatch.pr_revision_evaluator`
needs a *previous* :class:`~agent_dispatch.github_provider_adapter.
PRObservation` to detect staleness, and
:mod:`agent_dispatch.pr_polling_policy` needs a *last observed at* timestamp
to decide whether a fallback poll is due -- both need something to hold
state between calls. This module is that store.

Deliberately its **own small SQLite file**, not a new table folded into
``queue.py``. Every other Phase 9/10 machine's live-runtime table lives in
``queue.py``'s single database, but that module is already the plugin's
largest by a wide margin (grandfathered in `tools/module-size-baseline.json`
at its current size) -- growing it further to host an unrelated concern
(PR-target observation caching has no owner/generation/claim semantics in
common with task/spawn-reservation/routing-assignment rows) is exactly the
unbounded-growth failure the module-size guard now exists to catch. A
self-contained store, one small module, is the componentized alternative:
``queue.py`` does not need to know this concern exists at all.

Concurrency is intentionally minimal: unlike ``queue.py``'s task/spawn rows
(claimed by many competing workers), a PR observation is written by exactly
one process at a time in every deployment this module is designed for today
(a single coordinator's polling/webhook loop) -- there is no multi-writer
race to fence with a CAS/generation primitive the way
:mod:`agent_dispatch.machine_coupling` does for the other machines. A plain
upsert under SQLite's own transaction is sufficient; add real fencing only
if a future slice introduces a genuinely concurrent writer.
