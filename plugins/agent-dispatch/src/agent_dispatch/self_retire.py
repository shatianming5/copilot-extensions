"""Owner-liveness tether for the coordinator's own generation: self-retire when
superseded.

Thin adapter over the shared ``single_instance_lease`` supersession decision
(process-slot-ownership Phase 4, the downstream tracker -- the same lib agent-bridge
already adopted via copilot-extensions #737). Detachment (a zero-downtime
redeploy stands the new coordinator up beside the old one and flips the shared
routing table so clients follow it) can leave a *demoted* coordinator running
with nothing to shut it down -- if the deploy orchestrator never sends the old
coordinator its retire signal (it crashed, or the cutover was abandoned), the
demoted generation lingers as a stranded ``serve --passive`` process. The fix: a
coordinator that observes it has been demoted -- a newer generation flipped the
routing table and now serves clients -- drains to its safe cutover point (no
in-flight claim) and exits on its own instead of lingering.

This module keeps agent-dispatch's ``is_superseded(config_dir, ...)`` shape -- it
reads the routing table via ``zdd`` and delegates the pure, fail-safe decision to
the library, which returns ``True`` only when the ``active`` entry is a
*different* pid, at a *strictly higher* generation, that is *actually listening*
(a live successor). Every ambiguous state -- no table, no/parse-broken ``active``
entry, our own pid still active, a not-higher generation, or a successor that is
not (yet) accepting connections -- returns ``False`` (stay alive). The
genuinely-active coordinator always reads its own pid as ``active`` and
therefore can never self-retire; only a demoted generation with a confirmed live
successor ever can.

The coordinator wires this into a guarded background loop (see
``coordinator.py`` lifespan); the loop is opt-in and additionally gates on the
coordinator being at its safe cutover point (the ``DrainGate`` reports no
in-flight claim) before it exits, so a claim mid-flight is never dropped.
