"""Runtime configuration for the agent-dispatch coordinator and CLI.

All values come from the environment so the same code runs loopback-only on a
lone dev box or against a designated coordinator host on a shared network:

- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_HOST`` / ``AGENT_DISPATCH_PORT`` -- where the coordinator binds.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_DB`` -- the SQLite queue file (server side).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN`` -- optional bearer token (server validates, client sends).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN`` -- separate coordinator control bearer
  required to activate or transition managed producer scopes.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_GC_INTERVAL`` -- seconds between automatic **liveness
  garbage-collection** passes (server side; ``0`` disables). A GC pass requeues a
  held task only when its owner worktree is *confirmed gone* -- not on elapsed
  time. ``AGENT_DISPATCH_SWEEP_INTERVAL`` is a **deprecated alias** kept for one
  release (the recovery mechanism moved from lease expiry to liveness).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_URL`` -- the coordinator base URL the CLI talks to (defaults to
  ``http://<host>:<port>``); set this to point the CLI at a remote coordinator.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_URL`` -- the **shared/elected coordinator** endpoint used
  for cross-machine dispatch (multi-machine binding: the always-on hosted-coordinator endpoint).
  A client keeps its **local** loopback coordinator for same-machine work and
  reaches this one only when it opts in (``--shared``), so the single-machine /
  works-with-no-service property is preserved (hybrid topology).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN`` -- bearer token for the shared coordinator
  (independent of the local ``AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN``; per-client, as the shared
  endpoint is exposed only through the secured mesh).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN`` -- control bearer for managed producer
  transitions on the shared coordinator.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY_COMMAND`` -- preferred on-demand command
  that prints the current producer capability; the raw
  ``AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY`` remains a fallback.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOSTART`` -- set to any value to disable the CLI's
  lazy on-demand coordinator start (a client command that finds no live local
  coordinator otherwise starts one detached, then proceeds).
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_HANDOFF_FALLBACK`` -- **default-off** opt-in for the
  coordinator's handoff-fallback reconciliation (an unclaimed
  ``handoff``-labeled ``proposed``/``queued`` task past
  ``AGENT_DISPATCH_HANDOFF_FALLBACK_GRACE`` triggers exactly one
  ``agent-bridge resume <worktree>`` (then ``send``; if a live interactive
  CLI still holds it, stopping it via ``agent-worktrees restart`` first) launch
  attempt; see
  ``efforts/active/context-handoff-overhaul``). Off by default because this is
  the coordinator autonomously spawning a real Copilot process on a time
  heuristic -- a genuinely safety-relevant action.
- ``AGENT_DISPATCH_HANDOFF_FALLBACK_GRACE`` -- seconds an unclaimed handoff task
  must sit idle before the fallback launch fires (default 1 hour: generous, so
  a stored handoff whose successor is merely mid cold-start, or an operator who
  simply hasn't looked yet, is never preempted).
