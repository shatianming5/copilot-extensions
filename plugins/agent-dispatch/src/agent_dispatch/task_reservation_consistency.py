"""Declarative compatibility table for task ``Status`` vs. active
``SpawnState`` pairings.

This module is the direct answer to a structural-review finding (rubber-duck
review of agent-dispatch's task-status/spawn-reservation state management,
2026-09-28, following the incident-driven fixes in PR #4512 and its
follow-up #4542): three separate cross-FSM orphan gaps were each found only
*after* a task got stuck for hours in production (the downstream PR's
COLD+QUEUED stall; two more found by inspection: reconcile()'s ``_TERMINAL``
missing ``COMPLETED``, and ``recover_gone()``'s ``SPAWNED``-only reservation
loop missing ``DEAD_LETTER``+``COLD``). Each fix closed one specific pairing
after the fact. This module instead declares -- as data, once -- **every**
``(Status, SpawnState)`` pairing this codebase's sweeps are aware of, so the
*next* gap is caught by a periodic, read-only, additive consistency sweep
(mirroring :mod:`agent_dispatch.spawn_reservation_machine`'s own
reservation<->bridge consistency relation and its "fail-anomalous" rule:
any pairing not explicitly whitelisted as consistent is an anomaly) instead
of waiting for the next multi-hour production stall to surface it.

Scope is deliberately narrow, matching
:meth:`agent_dispatch.supervisor.Supervisor.sweep_spawn_consistency`'s own
precedent: only the four **active** ``SpawnState`` values
(``RESERVING``, ``SPAWNED``, ``COLD``, ``RELEASING`` --
:data:`agent_dispatch.queue.SpawnState.ACTIVE`) are modeled. A concluded
reservation (``SETTLED``/``FAILED``/``REARMED``/``DEFERRED``) is just a
historical audit record and may legitimately coexist with *any* task
status -- it carries no live claim on capacity or an exclusive_key, so
there is nothing to reconcile against.

This module is deliberately **detection-only**, not an auto-fixer (per the
rubber-duck review's own explicit caution): each declared repair mechanism
already has its own liveness evidence and cleanup disposition requirements
that a blind "normalize this pairing" mutator could not safely reproduce.
Where analysis below found a pairing with **no** existing repair path
(``COLD`` while ``PROPOSED``, ``CLAIMED``, or ``STARTED`` -- see
``_UNCOVERED_ANOMALIES``), this module only logs it; it does not invent an
unreproduced repair for a combination never yet observed live, matching how
every real fix in this area so far started from a live reproduction, not a
guess.
