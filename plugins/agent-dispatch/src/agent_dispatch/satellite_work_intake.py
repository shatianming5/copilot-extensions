"""Satellite work-intake -- the claim-loop half of a ``role=satellite`` node.

Phase 1/2 (shipped) gave a satellite outbound presence, status push-out, and
a default-closed gate; Design item D (shipped) let the union view actually
*read* whatever it embodies. This module closes the remaining gap the
``satellite-agent-exposure`` effort's Phase 3 called out: a satellite
advertised presence but never **pulled** any of its own affinitied work.

There is no existing generic "poll the queue and spawn locally" daemon in
agent-dispatch to extend (every current spawn path,
``embody.spawn_embodied_worker``, fires once at task-creation time on
whichever machine created the task) -- see the effort's Proposal §Phase 3
Design for the investigation this module implements. The design is
deliberately conservative about **not** inventing a new claim transport: this
module only *discovers* candidate `queued` tasks affinitied to this machine
and triggers a local spawn for each; the spawned session performs the actual
atomic claim itself, under its own worktree identity, exactly the way every
other CLI-backed dispatch worker already does (see
``embody_prompts.autopilot_worker_prompt``). That means the natural
queued -> claimed transition already provides idempotency across ticks: once
a task is claimed, it stops showing up in a `status=queued` read. The one gap
that leaves open is a **tight race between ticks** -- a task discovered this
tick may not yet show as claimed by the time the *next* tick runs, if the
just-triggered spawn hasn't gotten around to claiming it yet -- so this module
also tracks a short-lived "recently triggered" set to avoid re-spawning for
the same task_id before that race window closes.
