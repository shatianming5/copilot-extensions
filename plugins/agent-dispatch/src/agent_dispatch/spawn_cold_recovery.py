see ``AGENTS.md``'s note on new additions going into a sibling module rather
than growing an already-near-ceiling file further) as its own coherent

    """Release a ``COLD`` reservation whose task ended up queued/unowned
    instead of the ``SUSPENDED``-with-owner shape every other cold-path
    sweep expects -- a permanent-orphan gap with no automatic recovery.

    A reservation goes ``COLD`` when its task is intentionally dormant (see
    :meth:`Supervisor.cool_dormant_bodies`), resumed later by
    :meth:`Supervisor.release_resumed_cold_tasks` -- but that resume path
    only fires for a reservation whose ``resume_requested`` flag is set (by
    ``submit_steer()``, itself gated on the task still being ``SUSPENDED``
    at the moment the steer lands) **and** whose task is still ``SUSPENDED``
    with a live owner when the sweep runs. Neither condition holds once the
    task ends up ``QUEUED``/unowned *before* a resume-triggering steer
    arrives -- at that point ``submit_steer()``'s resume branch is a no-op
    (status is no longer ``SUSPENDED``), so ``resume_requested`` never gets
    set, and :meth:`Supervisor.release_resumed_cold_tasks` would ALSO skip
    it even if it somehow did (it requires ``status == SUSPENDED`` and an
    owner). Nor does :meth:`Supervisor.recover_gone` cover it
    (``SPAWNED``-reservations only, explicitly skips ``SUSPENDED``), nor
    :meth:`Supervisor.reconcile` (terminal tasks only). The result: a
    ``COLD`` reservation whose task already went queued/unowned is a dead
    zone no automatic path ever revisits again -- confirmed live: a PR
    review sat unrecoverable for 5+ hours, surviving a full supervisor
    restart, until an operator manually failed the reservation by hand
    (the downstream PR's stall).

    The exact trigger that reclaims a dormant ``SUSPENDED`` task to
    ``QUEUED``/unowned ahead of its resume is, as of this writing, **not
    confirmed against the live call graph** -- an earlier revision of this
    docstring attributed it to "the coordinator's own lease-expiry GC," but
    no in-repo path was found that matches: ``reconcile_liveness`` only
    scans ``CLAIMED``/``STARTED`` tasks, never ``SUSPENDED``, and a
    ``SUSPENDED`` task carries no lease at all (``lease_expires_at`` is
    cleared on entry). Treat the trigger as unknown pending further tracing
    (rubber-duck review, 2026-09-28) -- this sweep repairs the resulting
    invariant violation (``QUEUED``/unowned task, confirmed-gone ``COLD``
    reservation) regardless of how a future case gets there.

    This closes that gap: any ``COLD`` reservation whose task is genuinely
    available (``QUEUED``, no owner, non-terminal) with a **confirmed**
    -gone/idle body is deferred here (not failed -- see the ``defer_spawn``
    call below), freeing its ``exclusive_key`` so the
    next :meth:`Supervisor.poll_once` reserves and embodies it fresh (the
    replacement resumes from the task's own ``progress_log``, same as every
    other confirmed-gone recovery in that class). Never acts on an
    unconfirmed/unknown liveness verdict, and never touches a reservation
    whose task is still genuinely ``SUSPENDED`` (that dormancy is
    intentional and stays :meth:`Supervisor.release_resumed_cold_tasks`'s
    job) or still actively owned.
