"""The reclaim path's replacement for the removed ``create --reclaim``
(agent-bridge-cold-resume Phase 3).

Extracted out of ``bridge.py`` (at its 1000-line module-size cap) rather than
inlined there. ``agent-bridge create --reclaim`` no longer exists: a create
into an occupied ``worktree_id`` has no break-glass of its own now.

**What "reclaim" actually means.** It is not merely "bypass the ownership
guard" -- the guard exists specifically to stop a second ACP controller
spawning alongside a still-live interactive Copilot CLI attached to the same
checkout. "Reclaim" is the verb for *deliberately taking that worktree away
from that other process*: kill the live interactive CLI holding it, THEN
create/resume the owned session in its place. agent-bridge's own CLI already
says as much (the 409 refusal's own text: "Stop that CLI first, then re-run
with --force to take it over") -- ``--force``/``reclaim=true`` was always
meant to be the *second* half of that two-step sequence, never a
substitute for the first. An earlier revision of this module only ever
performed the second half (bypassing the guard without actually stopping
anything, or later, never bypassing it at all) -- both wrong. This module
performs the whole sequence: ``agent-bridge restart-worktree <worktree_id>``
(the reclaim sequence's stop half -- shells to ``agent-worktrees restart``,
the exact primitive behind the Picker "Stop" action and Neuron Forge's own
"Take over": graceful double-Ctrl-C quit, then a hard mux kill-session --
and *additionally* expires the worktree's live-session registration
server-side on success, #2906; calling ``agent-worktrees restart`` directly
would skip that invalidation) confirms the interactive CLI is actually
gone, and only then does ``agent-bridge resume <worktree_id> --force`` take
the worktree over.

**Race between the stop and the forced resume.** ``restart`` and the
following ``resume --force`` are two separate calls; a *different* live
interactive CLI could attach to the worktree in the gap between them, and
``--force`` bypasses the ownership guard unconditionally. Forcing straight
through in that window would recreate the exact duplicate-controller race
the guard exists to prevent -- forcing past a holder we never actually
confirmed dead. Two layers close this:

1. ``restart-worktree`` is called with ``--expected-holder`` set to the
   *original* refusal's holder session id, so the server-side
   invalidate-on-take-over (#2906) is fenced to only that registration -- a
   genuinely different claimant that registers for this worktree while the
   stop is in flight is never collaterally demoted.
2. After ``restart`` succeeds, this repeats the *plain* (non-forcing)
   resume check once more before ever forcing: if that succeeds outright,
   no force was even needed (best case). If it is refused again for the
   same reason, this compares the refusal's holder session id against the
   original one -- identical means the guard is still keyed on the (now
   confirmed-dead) process we just stopped, so forcing through it is safe;
   a *different* id means a fresh claimant won the worktree in the race
   window (and, thanks to the fencing above, that claimant's own
   registration was never touched), and this refuses rather than force
   through a live process it never confirmed dead.

:func:`resume_worktree_and_send` orchestrates the whole sequence, then
delivers ``prompt`` via ``send <session_id> --prompt-file - --caller
<caller>`` -- mirroring ``bridge.resume_worker``'s own resume-then-send
shape for a known session id, plus the same synthetic ``--caller`` the old
``create`` invocation always supplied (without it, ``send`` resolves no
caller from this coordinator's neutral CWD, and successive workers could
consume or advance one another's shared delivery cursor).

**No legacy-daemon fallback.** A not-yet-upgraded agent-bridge daemon's
``resume`` predates ``--json`` support entirely, so a *successful*
(returncode 0) resume there prints the old human ``[OK] ...`` line instead
of a parseable session-id envelope. There is no safe way to recover the id
of a session an old daemon already resumed/created without parseable
output, so this reports the failure (the caller degrades by leaving the
task queued) rather than risk a duplicate controller by guessing. This is a
real gap during a rolling upgrade -- resolved automatically once
agent-bridge is upgraded too.

``resume`` *reuses* an existing session when one is already live for the
worktree -- it only starts a fresh one when none exists. The old
``create --reclaim`` path instead always requested a brand-new session
(``force_new=True``), ignoring any existing one outright. If the reused
session happens to be mid-turn, plain ``send`` refuses it busy (exit code
``_SEND_BUSY_EXIT`` = 75, ``agent_bridge.__main__``) rather than force
through -- ``send`` deliberately has no ``--force`` of its own (that
belongs to ``create``). Since this whole path only runs when the caller has
already judged the *task* safe to take over, a busy reuse (an ACP-owned
turn, not a rival interactive CLI) is handled the same way: ``end --force``
the busy session -- which *deletes* it, so the prompt can no longer reach
that exact id -- then **resume the worktree again** (getting its
replacement, since the busy one is now gone) and send to that one, once.
