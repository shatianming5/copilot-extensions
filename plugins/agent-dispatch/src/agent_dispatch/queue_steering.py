"""``TaskQueue`` mixin: card/steer, wake-outbox, and pin-portability methods.

Extracted from :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue` as the next coherent responsibility
band after the earlier schedule / routing / spawn / producer-fence splits:
operator interaction state (cards, steer drafts/answers, wake delivery, and the
small pin-portability ``detach`` helper) is distinct from task creation,
claiming, and lifecycle transitions.

This mixin is composed into :class:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue` via
multiple inheritance; it relies on queue-owned primitives such as
``self._connect()``, ``self._fetch()``, ``self._audit()``, ``self._now()``,
``self._enqueue_wake()``'s transaction context, and the wake/owned-transition
notifiers. It is not usable standalone.
