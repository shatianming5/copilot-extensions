"""Generic embody spawn supervisor -- turn queued tasks into host embody sessions.

The supervisor is the delegation layer's answer to "a queued task should become
exactly one host-side embody autopilot, durably." It sits on top of the
:mod:`~agent_dispatch.queue` **spawn-reservation** primitive (see
``docs/spawn-supervisor.md``) and is deliberately **generic**: no producer- or
consumer-specific logic leaks into it.

Safety is the whole point, so the loop is built around a single hard invariant:

    **A task is spawned only when a fresh spawn reservation is acquired for it.**

Because ``reserve_spawn`` returns ``reserved=False`` whenever an *active*
(``reserving``/``spawned``) reservation already exists for a task, a task that is
already being spawned -- or was spawned and later re-queued (e.g. its lease
expired while the embody is merely slow) -- is **never** spawned a second time.
Lease expiry is *not* treated as death: a re-queued task keeps its ``spawned``
reservation and is skipped, so a slow-but-alive embody can never be
double-spawned (the exact failure this component exists to prevent).

A reservation is released for a **fresh** spawn only when its task reaches a
**terminal** state (``completed``/``abandoned`` -> ``reconcile`` settles it) or
when an operator explicitly fails it (having confirmed the embody is gone). That
means **auto-recovery of a genuinely dead-but-non-terminal embody is
intentionally NOT done here** -- it requires embody-session *liveness detection*
(so lease expiry can be trusted as death and the supervisor can drive the
heartbeat of a live-but-quiet worker). That liveness-aware slice is future work;
until then, a dead embody's task is held (its ``spawned`` reservation blocks
re-spawn) and surfaced for a human, which is the safe default.

          resumes from the task's ``progress_log``. A still-leased task is first
          **requeued on the gone owner's behalf** (an on-behalf ``yield_task``,
          across worktree, fleet, and local bodies alike) so re-embody is prompt
          rather than waiting out the lease -- the coordinator's own lease-expiry
          GC is only the backstop. A task whose embody died *before* it claimed is
          already queued.
        - ``live``    -> leave it (:meth:`hold_live_leases` heartbeats it).
        - ``unknown`` -> leave it. A still-starting-up worker, or an unreachable
          bridge, is **never** treated as death -- recovery never fires on
          ignorance (the safety guarantee behind liveness-not-lease).

        A terminal task is settled by :meth:`reconcile`; a dead-lettered one is
        settled here (held, not re-spawned). A body that posted a card/progress
        beat after its reservation is also settled: its turn succeeded, so its
        normal exit must not consume the failed-*spawn* budget. An unproductive
        disappearance uses ``fail_spawn`` and still counts toward dead-lettering.
        Returns the count recovered.
