"""Generic embody spawn supervisor -- turn queued tasks into host embody sessions.

The supervisor is the delegation layer's answer to "a queued task should become
exactly one host-side embody autopilot, durably." It sits on top of the
:mod:`~agent_dispatch.queue` **spawn-reservation** primitive (see
``docs/spawn-supervisor.md``) and is deliberately **generic**: no producer- or
consumer-specific logic leaks into it.

Safety is the whole point, so the loop is built around a single hard invariant:

    **A task is spawned only when a fresh spawn reservation is acquired for it.**

Because ``reserve_spawn`` returns ``reserved=False`` whenever an *active*
(``reserving``/``spawned``) reservation already exists for a task, a task that is
already being spawned -- or was spawned and later re-queued (e.g. its lease
expired while the embody is merely slow) -- is **never** spawned a second time.
Lease expiry is *not* treated as death: a re-queued task keeps its ``spawned``
reservation and is skipped, so a slow-but-alive embody can never be
double-spawned (the exact failure this component exists to prevent).

A reservation is released for a **fresh** spawn only when its task reaches a
**terminal** state (``submitted``/``abandoned`` -> ``reconcile`` settles it) or
when an operator explicitly fails it (having confirmed the embody is gone). That
means **auto-recovery of a genuinely dead-but-non-terminal embody is
intentionally NOT done here** -- it requires embody-session *liveness detection*
(so lease expiry can be trusted as death and the supervisor can drive the
heartbeat of a live-but-quiet worker). That liveness-aware slice is future work;
until then, a dead embody's task is held (its ``spawned`` reservation blocks
re-spawn) and surfaced for a human, which is the safe default.

        gap, previously unbounded: the embody/spawn call can silently fail or
        hang with no session ever launched, and -- unlike the handle-less

        ``reserving`` indefinitely with no automatic recovery (confirmed in a
        real deployment: 46+ minutes, only noticed and manually recovered by
        an operator -- see #3354). It now shares the same ``reserving_timeout``
        bound: past that age, with no session ever observed, this supervisor
        fails its own reservation so a fresh attempt can be reserved.

        :mod:`agent_dispatch.spawn_reservation_machine`'s declared
        reservation<->bridge consistency relation and single-assignment
        invariant against this pool's real, current reservation rows.

        Read-only and additive: this never mutates a reservation or a
        task, and it changes no other reconciliation method's behavior --
        it only classifies today's real state and logs any detected
        anomaly, so the declared classification functions are actually
        exercised against live data rather than only proven sound in
        isolation. Called every cycle by :meth:`poll_once` when
        ``consistency_sweep`` is enabled (the default) -- the periodic
        cadence this docstring previously left as a follow-up decision;
        it also remains safe to call directly at any time.

        Liveness is resolved only for reservations carrying a local body
        handle, via the same ``local_body_verdict_fn`` the rest of this
        module already uses, translated through
        :func:`spawn_reservation_machine.verdict_to_bridge_state`. A
        reservation without a local handle, or whose verdict is
        ``unknown``, is skipped (:attr:`ConsistencyTier.NOT_APPLICABLE`)
        rather than guessed at.

        Returns a summary dict: ``checked`` (reservations with a
        resolvable bridge state), ``anomalies`` (count classified as
        :attr:`ConsistencyTier.ANOMALY`), and
        ``assignment_violations`` (task/exclusive-key groups with more
        than one simultaneously ``ACTIVE`` reservation).

        For each ``spawned`` reservation, resolve the embodied session's liveness
        to the tri-state verdict (identity-keyed on the task's captured
        ``owner_session_id``) and act **only on a confirmed** result:

        - ``gone``    -> the embody is provably absent (its worktree is empty, or a
          different session reused it). Release the reservation (``fail_spawn``) so
          the next :meth:`poll_once` can re-reserve and re-embody; the replacement
          resumes from the task's ``progress_log``. A still-leased task is first
          **requeued on the gone owner's behalf** (an on-behalf ``yield_task``,
          across worktree, fleet, and local bodies alike) so re-embody is prompt
          rather than waiting out the lease -- the coordinator's own lease-expiry
          GC is only the backstop. A task whose embody died *before* it claimed is
          already queued.
        - ``live``    -> leave it (:meth:`hold_live_leases` heartbeats it).
        - ``unknown`` -> leave it. A still-starting-up worker, or an unreachable
          bridge, is **never** treated as death -- recovery never fires on
          ignorance (the safety guarantee behind liveness-not-lease).

        A terminal task is settled by :meth:`reconcile`; a dead-lettered one is
        settled here (held, not re-spawned). A body that posted a card/progress
        beat after its reservation is also settled: its turn succeeded, so its
        normal exit must not consume the failed-*spawn* budget. An unproductive
        disappearance uses ``fail_spawn`` and still counts toward dead-lettering.
