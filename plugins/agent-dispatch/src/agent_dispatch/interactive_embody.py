"""Phase 1 item 3: the interactive-embodiment transaction.

A new, coordinator-owned, atomic operation (never a bare picker navigation
verb) that opens an *interactive*, CLI-backed session an operator watches or
drives -- the "Open into a CLI session" action's real backend, and the
non-negotiable other half of Phase 1's ``cli_openable`` contract alongside
item 2's auto-suspend-on-dead-liveness.

Confirmed flow (operator-approved design, see the effort's Runbook/Journal):

1. Create a new worktree if the task has none, else resolve/reuse its
   existing one -- delegated to :func:`agent_dispatch.embody
   .prepare_reusable_worktree`, the SAME resolve-or-create logic
   ``Supervisor`` itself uses for a reusable-worktree spawn backend
   (:meth:`Supervisor._prepare_spawn_task`).
2. Bind that worktree to the task and auto-claim/resume it under the
   task's own worktree identity (``worker_id_for(machine, worktree)``) --
   the exact same ``claim``/``start``/``resume`` primitives (and their
   generation/owner-session CAS fencing) a normal pool claim uses.
3. Compose the succinct, non-railroaded ``--interactive`` seed
   (:func:`agent_dispatch.embody_prompts.interactive_worker_prompt`) --
   never a worker identity or pool/recipe framing.
4. Launch it via :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.spawn_embodied_worker`'s
   existing CLI-backed autopilot session mechanism (a new *seed*/path
   through it, not a new session-launch primitive), then record the
   resulting session handle on the spawn reservation.

Never resolves a pool or a named worker identity (:mod:`agent_dispatch
.worker_identities`) at any point -- the reservation this transaction takes
is the SAME at-most-one-in-flight primitive every embodiment path uses, not
a pool assignment.

**Ordering of step 2 relative to step 4 (bind vs. launch) deliberately
differs by starting status**, because ``owner_session_id`` -- the identity
item 2's liveness GC keys on -- is only known once the Copilot session in
step 4 actually exists, and only a **queued** task has a real "someone else
claims it first" race to close:

- A fresh **queued** task IS claimable by a concurrent pool worker, so
  ownership is split in two: ``claim`` (worktree identity only, no session
  yet) happens *before* the launch -- removing it from the claimable pool --
  and ``start(..., owner_session_id=<new session>)`` finalizes it
  *afterward*, once the session exists.
- A **suspended** task is not claimable by anyone (``claim`` only ever picks
  from ``queued``), so there is no race to close by binding early. Its
  single-step ``resume(..., adopt_owner_session_id=...)`` transition needs
  the new session id anyway, so it runs *after* the launch, atomically
  adopting the fresh session in one step.

**Failure/recovery story:**

- *Worktree preparation fails* (create_worktree/resolve_worktree/agent-
  worktrees unavailable): the spawn reservation is released (``fail_spawn``)
  before the error propagates; no Copilot process was ever launched.
- *A queued task's pre-launch claim loses the race* (another pool worker
  claimed it first): released the same way, before any launch is attempted.
- *The launch itself fails, exits nonzero, or reports no session id*: the
  reservation is released, and -- for the queued path only, which already
  moved the task to ``claimed`` before attempting the launch -- the claim
  itself is undone (``yield_task``) so the task returns to ``queued``
  rather than being stranded ``claimed`` with no session and no active
  reservation (a state item 2's liveness GC cannot recover on its own: it
  never escalates an uncaptured ``owner_session_id`` to ``gone``). The
  suspended/resume path never claims anything pre-launch, so it has nothing
  to undo here.
- *Launch succeeds but the follow-up start/resume bind fails* (a resume
  generation race, or a held task discovered only at bind time): the task is
  left with a live, unbound Copilot session and no ownership -- annoying to
  clean up by hand but not a correctness hazard, since nothing else can earn
  ownership of a ``suspended``/``claimed`` task out from under this failure
  without its own explicit action. This is the one edge this transaction
  does not self-heal automatically; a future revision could have the
  launched session itself detect its own unbound state and retry the bind.
