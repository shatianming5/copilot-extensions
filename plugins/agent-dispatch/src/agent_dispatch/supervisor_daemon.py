"""The **singleton supervisor daemon** -- the master runtime that runs the
registered work on one host.

Where :mod:`agent_dispatch.registrations` defines *what* is registered and the
coordinator store persists it, this module is *what runs it*: exactly **one**
supervisor process per machine-and-environment reads the registration registry
and drives each **active** registration in its **own subprocess**, reconciling
the running set against the registry on every tick -- starting a newly-registered
unit, restarting one whose spec changed, winding down one that was removed or
paused, and reviving one whose subprocess crashed. One busy or failing unit is
isolated in its own child, so it never blocks its siblings or the master.

Single-instance is enforced with the store's **pin-not-failover** election (a
schedule-lease over a ``supervisor:<machine>:<env>`` scope): the first daemon
wins the scope and a second **stands down** rather than spawning a rival loop --
the *one supervisor per machine-and-environment* the vision requires.

This increment lands the daemon mechanics and the **supervised-lane** unit
(reconstruct the ``agent-dispatch supervise`` foreground loop from a stored
spec). Folding the schedule / emitter / evaluator kinds into units the daemon
runs is the next increment; an unsupported kind is logged and skipped, never
fatal. The class is transport-light and fully injectable (launcher, clock,
sleep) so its reconcile logic is unit-tested without real subprocesses.

Registration fingerprinting, desired-set diffing, command-line building, and
the launcher/handle protocols used to live here too; they moved to
``supervisor_registration.py`` to keep this module under its
line-count ceiling as the repo grows. Every name is re-imported below so
existing ``from .supervisor_daemon import ...`` call sites and tests are
unaffected.

See ``visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`` -- Concept *the supervisor*, Feature
*registered-supervision*, Behavior *supervise-registers-and-returns*.

        still tracked in ``_probe_inflight`` until it actually finishes --

        ``atexit`` hook that joins every live ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` worker
        thread at interpreter exit regardless, so a genuinely stuck health/
        validate call (e.g. still waiting on the same interprocess lock a
        slow materialize() build holds, up to its own multi-minute ceiling)
        can otherwise delay actual process exit for as long as that
        operation's own ceiling allows.
