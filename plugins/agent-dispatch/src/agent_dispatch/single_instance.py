"""A crash-safe, cross-platform **single-instance lock** for the supervisor daemon.

The singleton supervisor must be *exactly one process per machine-and-environment*,
and -- critically -- a daemon that **crashes without cleaning up must not
permanently block its own restart**. A store lease (pin-not-failover) can't give
that: a random per-process holder that never releases would lock the scope
forever. An **OS advisory lock on a lock file** does exactly the right thing: the
kernel releases it automatically when the holding process dies, so a restart
reacquires cleanly, while a *live* second daemon is refused.

``SingleInstance.acquire`` takes a non-blocking exclusive lock (``fcntl.flock`` on
POSIX, ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows). :func:`is_locked` is a cheap liveness probe
-- it tries to acquire and immediately releases, so ``supervise daemon-status`` /
``--ensure`` can ask "is a daemon already holding this scope?" without racing.
