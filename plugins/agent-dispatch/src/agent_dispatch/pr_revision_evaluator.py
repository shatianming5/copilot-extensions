"""Revision-history evaluator for reviewer-side PR-state observers.

Phase 10 item 3, third slice: the provider adapters observe a PR's *current*
raw state, but a single snapshot cannot tell
whether an existing ``APPROVED`` verdict still covers the PR's current head
-- that is a function of *two* observations over time, per
:func:`agent_dispatch.provider_state_machine.classify_revision_change`. This
module is that comparison, made real against the declared
``APPROVAL_TRANSITIONS`` table rather than re-deciding the rule inline --
the same "the declared table is the actual governing data" discipline Phase
10 items 1 and 2 already established for the task machine's own transitions.

Deliberately narrow, matching the rest of item 3's slices:

- :func:`evaluate_observation` is pure: two :class:`~agent_dispatch.
  github_provider_adapter.PRObservation` values (or ``None`` for the first
  observation) in, one out. No network, no persistence.
- It does not decide *where* the ``previous`` observation is stored between
  calls -- that is the persistence slice this item still needs (a
  per-(repo, PR) store, likely a new ``queue.py`` table given the plugin's
  existing convention of one additive table per declared machine).
- It never applies ``revalidate_stale``: that transition exists for when a
  reviewer re-requests review after a stale approval, which is simply
  whatever the provider's own ``reviewDecision`` already reports on the
  next observation (e.g. ``REVIEW_REQUIRED``) -- nothing this evaluator
  needs to force, since it always recomputes from the provider's current
  raw approval status, not from a locally cached "STALE" flag.
