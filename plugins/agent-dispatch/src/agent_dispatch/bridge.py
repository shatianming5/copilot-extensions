"""agent-bridge integration: spawn a worker agent to execute a task.

agent-dispatch stays decoupled from agent-bridge -- it shells out to the
``agent-bridge`` CLI binstub when present, and degrades gracefully (leaving the
task queued for any worker to claim) when it is not. agent-bridge is an
*optional* producer of workers, never a hard dependency, so agent-dispatch
remains a standalone plugin usable where no bridge exists.

    Runs either:

    - ``agent-bridge [--json] create <agent> "<prompt>" --caller <id>
      [--no-wait]`` for a **venue/direct target**; or
    - for a hidden worktree-bound charter profile, creates/resolves the
      target worktree first and then routes through ``resume <worktree>`` +
      ``send <worktree>`` so agent-bridge applies the bound charter's spawn
      shape from the worktree.

    Raises :class:`BridgeUnavailable` if the needed CLI/runtime is unavailable;
    the caller degrades by leaving the task queued.

    ``prompt`` overrides the default worker seed (:func:`worker_prompt`). A caller
    embodying a task headlessly with richer semantics -- e.g. the supervisor's
    headless embody backend, which reuses the CLI autopilot seed so a
    headless-embodied task is driven identically to a CLI-embodied one -- passes
    the seed it wants delivered verbatim. ``route`` is threaded into the default
    seed only (ignored when ``prompt`` is supplied).

    ``json_output`` inserts the ``--json`` global flag before ``create`` so the
    created session id rides stdout as JSON -- the caller then records a recovery
    handle (the local agent-bridge session id) for liveness-gated auto-recovery
    of an orphaned reservation (see
    :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.parse_fleet_body_session` /
    :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.local_body_verdict`).

    ``reclaim`` is agent-dispatch's own judgment that ``worktree_id`` is stale
    and safe to take over (e.g. an unclaimed handoff task past a bounded
    reconciliation window) -- it never implements the in-place replacement
    itself; that is agent-bridge's job. ``create --reclaim`` was removed
    (agent-bridge-cold-resume Phase 3), so this delegates to
    :func:`bridge_reclaim.resume_worktree_and_send`: resume ``worktree_id``
    and, if a live interactive CLI still holds it, stop it first (see that
    module's own docstring), then ``send`` the seed -- the old ``create
    --reclaim`` invocation's equivalent, done right this time.

    ``--caller`` (copilot-extensions#2202): without an explicit caller, `create`
    derives one from the *current process's own* worktree context -- meaningless
    for a long-running supervisor daemon that isn't itself running inside any
    single worktree. That leaves ``caller_worktree`` unset on the spawned target,
    so agent-worktrees' ``resolved_origin`` falls through to ``"user"`` (Picker-
    visible, freely drivable) instead of ``"delegate"`` (Picker-hidden) -- every
    autopilot-style worker this function spawns looked exactly like a worktree
    the operator created themselves, inviting accidental manual takeover of a
    live, task-owning worker. A stable, task-attempt-scoped synthetic identity
    here (it need not resolve to a real worktree; the origin check is presence-only)
    fixes that regardless of the daemon's own execution context.
