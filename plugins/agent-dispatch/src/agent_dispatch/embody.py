"""agent-worktrees integration: dispatch a task to a CLI-backed autopilot session.

Unlike :mod:`agent_dispatch.bridge` (which spawns a *headless* agent-bridge ACP
worker), this spawns a durable, **CLI-backed autopilot** session in a fresh
parallel worktree on the same machine via ``agent-worktrees embody``. The
embodied Copilot launches with ``--allow-all-tools`` (tools auto-approved -- no
per-tool confirmation prompts), claims and starts the task, works it
autonomously, and marks the task ``completed`` **explicitly** only when it judges
the goal reached -- *deferred completion*, never stamped at spawn or pickup.

agent-dispatch stays decoupled: it shells out to the ``agent-worktrees`` runtime
(its venv interpreter via ``-m agent_worktrees`` when present, else the binstub
on PATH) and degrades gracefully (the caller falls back to the bridge backend,
or leaves the task queued) when it is not -- so the plugin remains standalone on
a host without agent-worktrees.

    done** -- it must not complete before the goal is met.

    The worker drives its whole lifecycle under its **worktree identity**
