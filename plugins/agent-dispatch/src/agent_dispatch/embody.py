"""agent-worktrees integration: dispatch a task to a CLI-backed autopilot session.

Unlike :mod:`agent_dispatch.bridge` (which spawns a *headless* agent-bridge ACP
worker), this spawns a durable, **CLI-backed autopilot** session in a fresh
parallel worktree on the same machine via ``agent-worktrees embody``. The
embodied Copilot launches with ``--allow-all --experimental`` (all prompts
auto-approved, and SDK extensions allowed to load), claims and starts the task, works it
autonomously, and marks the task ``submitted`` **explicitly** only when it judges
the goal reached -- *deferred completion*, never stamped at spawn or pickup.

agent-dispatch stays decoupled: it shells out to the ``agent-worktrees`` runtime
(its venv interpreter via ``-m agent_worktrees`` when present, else the binstub
on PATH) and degrades gracefully (the caller falls back to the bridge backend,
or leaves the task queued) when it is not -- so the plugin remains standalone on
a host without agent-worktrees.

The two autopilot seed-prompt builders (``autopilot_worker_prompt``,
``fleet_autopilot_worker_prompt``) live in :mod:`agent_dispatch.embody_prompts`
(componentization: this module was over the repo's module-size cap) and are
re-exported here under their original names, so every existing call site is
unaffected.

    SSH alias) through the local Bridge carrier, with bounded SSH fallback only

    (:func:`fleet_autopilot_worker_prompt`) to drive the ``task_id`` lease back to

    headless-fleet task is driven exactly like a CLI-fleet one.

    Why headless for the fleet: a seeded CLI/mux session can race the input caret
    and never deliver its startup seed (the documented "Loading..." hang), so a
    kicked CLI body may never claim its task. A headless ACP body sidesteps the
    CLI-start-prompt path entirely, so a fleet body embodies reliably on the pool
    host without a human attach -- the right body for bounded, self-contained
    sweeps.

    Unlike the CLI body, a headless body is **not a parallel worktree**, so no
    worktree handle is recovered (the caller records ``worktree=None``); the
    ``--no-wait`` create returns once the ACP session is spawned into the host's
    bridge daemon, which owns it independently of the command transport.
