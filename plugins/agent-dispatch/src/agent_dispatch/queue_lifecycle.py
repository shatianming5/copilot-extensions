"""``TaskQueue`` mixin: task lifecycle, ownership, and progress methods.

Extracted from :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue` as the next large responsibility
band after the steering/wake slice: transitions between task states, the
ownership/session fences they enforce, and the durable progress trail all hang
off one shared transition primitive.

This mixin is composed into :class:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue` via
multiple inheritance; it relies on queue-owned storage helpers such as
``self._connect()``, ``self._fetch()``, ``self._audit()``, ``self._now()``,
``self._record_attachment()``, and ``self._enqueue_wake()`` and is not usable
standalone.
