"""Fleet dispatch: turn queued tasks into embody bodies on a **pool of hosts**.

The base supervisor (:mod:`agent_dispatch.supervisor`) spawns an embody body on
its **own** machine. Fleet dispatch lets an always-on supervisor instead fan
bodies out across a **pool of capable-but-not-always-on hosts** -- the shape a
containerized, always-on producer needs when the real work should run on
workstations elsewhere in the mesh.

The design (Model C) keeps the strong guarantee where it belongs:

- **Origin-owned lease.** The spawn reservation and the task lease stay on the
  supervisor's (origin's) coordinator, so at-most-once is **fleet-wide**, not
  per-pool-host. Only the *body* runs remotely; it drives the origin task back
  over the existing bidirectional SSH mesh (see
  :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.spawn_fleet_embodied_worker`). No new network bind
  is introduced on the origin.
- **Liveness-gated selection.** A pool host is a candidate only when it is
  reachable over SSH **and** has ``agent-worktrees`` (or ``agent-bridge`` in
  headless-fleet mode) -- so it can actually embody. The first live candidate by
  policy (config order) is chosen.
- **Defer, don't fail, when the pool is asleep.** :meth:`FleetSpawner.can_spawn`
  is the supervisor's **capacity gate**: when no host is live, the task is skipped
  for this cycle **without a reservation**, so an all-asleep pool never burns
  spawn attempts toward the dead-letter bound. Selection is cached briefly so the
  gate and the subsequent spawn agree on the same host without re-probing.

Nothing here is consumer-specific: a :class:`FleetSpawner` is keyed only on host
aliases + task ids.
