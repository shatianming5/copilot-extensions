"""Declarative transition table for the bridge/session state machine.

This module is the Phase 9 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability/phase-9-state-machine-architecture.md``)
bridge/session machine made real, following the same declared-table shape
:mod:`agent_dispatch.task_state_machine` and
:mod:`agent_dispatch.provider_state_machine` already used: name every legal
transition once, as data, tagged with a recovery mode from the shared
:class:`agent_dispatch.task_state_machine.RecoveryMode` taxonomy.

This module owns the **corrected liveness model** the phase-9 sub-doc
folded in from a downstream deployment's operator design conversation:
liveness is a live, three-tier read (hot/warm/cold), never gated by a
cache. A liveness cache (a discovery
index, a session-record table) is a performance shortcut only -- it must
never be treated as authoritative. :func:`resolve_liveness` makes that
literal: it always calls the live probe and ignores any cache hint's
*value*, using the hint only as an optional hint to callers, never as a
substitute for the live check.

The companion agent-bridge vision
(``visions/plugins/agent-bridge/README.md``) is the intended long-term
source of truth for the bridge's own verb vocabulary and now also declares
the hot/warm/cold liveness tiers and the cache-is-never-authority rule (its
``cache-is-a-hint-never-authority`` behavior). This module realizes that
vision item: it implements the lifecycle states and the
liveness-to-transition coupling this effort needs, reconciled with the
vision rather than duplicating or competing with its verb set.
