"""Best-effort embodiment tracking: overlay a leased task's live CLI-session
status from the agent-bridge live-session registry.

The join key already exists -- a claimed task's ``owner`` is
``"<machine>/<worktree>"`` (see :func:`queue.worker_id_for`), and agent-bridge's
live-session registry is keyed by ``worktree_id``. So we resolve the worktree
handle to its live session and surface a **read-only** liveness overlay, making a
CLI-embodied task as trackable as a headless one (closes
``visions/agent-fabric`` behavior *lifetime-decides-embodiment*: a durable CLI
body is "trackable by task coordination").

Derived on read -- agent-dispatch persists no session state and gains no
heartbeat writer. Purely best-effort: if ``agent-bridge`` is absent or
unreachable, tracking is simply unavailable (the *discover-and-degrade*
behavior), and ``show``/``list`` render exactly as before.

**Cross-machine (Phase 8 Slice 8b).** The overlay resolves against the *owner's*
machine, not just the local one. An SSH-pushed dispatch (8a) lives on the
target's coordinator and embodies on the target's bridge, so its ``owner`` names
a *remote* machine. When that machine is not the local one, the live-session
resolve runs on it over the SSH mesh (``ssh <machine> agent-bridge ...``
-- the machine name **is** its SSH alias, per the SSH-alias discipline
discipline), making a remote-dispatched task as observable as a local one. Still
best-effort: no ``ssh`` on PATH, an unreachable host, or a missing remote
``agent-bridge`` collapses to "no overlay", exactly like the local miss.

    The safety crux GC depends on. It is keyed on the owner's **session
    identity**, not mere worktree occupancy -- because a worktree is reused across
    sessions, so "a session occupies the worktree" does not mean "*this task's*
    owner is alive." Two failure modes this closes: a reused worktree hiding a
    gone owner (false ``live``), and a claim-before-registration race requeuing a
    live owner (false ``gone``).

    Given the task's captured ``owner_session_id``:

    - :data:`LIVE` -- the resolver answered and the worktree's **current** live
      session **is** ``owner_session_id`` (the same owner is still there).
    - :data:`GONE` -- the resolver answered authoritatively and the worktree is
      **empty** (``{}``) or holds a **different** session id than
      ``owner_session_id`` (a new session reused the worktree; our owner is gone).
    - :data:`UNKNOWN` -- the resolver could not answer (no CLI/ssh, non-zero exit,
      timeout, unparseable/non-object output -- a possibly restarting/partial
      registry), **or** ``owner_session_id`` is not captured yet (the claim ->
      register window). GC leaves the task alone (degrade safe; never requeue on
      ignorance or an unattributable snapshot).

    This function is the shared resolver for *every* claimed/started task's
    liveness GC (:meth:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue.reconcile_liveness`), not
    only spawn-reservation-owned worktrees -- a generically claimed task's
    ``worktree`` may be an arbitrary handle with no agent-worktrees record at
    all, and an uncaptured ``owner_session_id`` can legitimately mean "claim
    not yet registered" for a still-live worker. It therefore never escalates
    an uncaptured ``owner_session_id`` to :data:`GONE` by itself, no matter
    what the bridge or the local agent-worktrees registry reports. A caller
    that positively knows a specific worktree is exclusively owned by its own
    spawn reservation (so the local agent-worktrees registry is authoritative
    for that worktree's existence) may layer an additional, narrowly-scoped
    absent-worktree check of its own on top of this result -- see

    registry, in **any** tracking status.

    Unlike :func:`live_worktrees` (deliberately ACTIVE-only, for orphan
    reaping), this checks presence across ``active``/``complete``/
    ``finalized``/``orphaned`` alike: a ``finalized`` worktree is explicitly
    allowed to remain fully present on disk, so an ACTIVE-only scope would
    misreport it as absent. The registry's own default listing (no ``--all``)
    already excludes rows whose directory no longer exists on disk, so a
    present row for this exact id is authoritative directory-presence
    evidence; an empty result means the directory is genuinely gone.

    ``project`` names the target project explicitly (``agent-worktrees``'
    global ``--project`` option, preceding the subcommand) -- required in
    practice for a CWD-neutral caller (a supervisor daemon's working
    directory is a service runtime dir, not necessarily the repo whose
    reservation this worktree belongs to), exactly like
    :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.project_for_task`'s callers. Omitting it
    falls back to ``agent-worktrees``' own CWD-based project discovery,
    which is only correct when the caller's CWD happens to match.

    Always passes ``--include-other-platforms``: the registry's default
    ``list`` filters to the host's *current* detected local platform, so a
    reservation created on this same host under a different local platform
    (e.g. Windows vs. WSL) would otherwise be silently omitted -- this
    function answers presence, not per-platform enumeration.

    Returns ``None`` on **any** resolver failure (no CLI, non-zero exit,
    timeout, empty or unparseable output) so the caller degrades safe --
    an unresolved probe never counts as "gone". Never raises.

    **Known residual risk (shared with** :func:`live_worktrees` **, not new
    here):** agent-worktrees' own registry reader silently skips a tracking
    record that fails to load (corrupt/partially-written YAML) rather than
    reporting it, so an empty result cannot be perfectly distinguished from
    "this exact record is transiently unreadable." This is an existing,
    platform-wide characteristic of every caller of that registry today, not
    a regression introduced by this function; closing it fully needs an
    agent-worktrees-side signal (e.g. a skipped-record count or an exact-ID
    lookup that reports "unreadable" distinctly from "absent"), which is out
    of scope for this caller to invent unilaterally.
