"""Phase 3a -- the agent-dispatch CLI-relayed daemon fast path.

Lazily imported from ``board_cli.py``'s ``--subscribe`` branch only (never
from the plain one-shot path or the delegated/cross-machine path), so that
``board_cli.py``'s own "fast stdlib-only" footprint for every other
invocation is unchanged -- this module is the only place in the package that
needs ``httpx`` (via :class:`DispatchClient`).

See ``efforts/active/pivot-streaming-transport/phase-3-design.md`` for the
full design this implements. Summary of the architecture actually used here,
which intentionally differs from that document's own multi-writer framing
(every requirement it lists is still satisfied, just by a simpler
mechanism): a **single** control loop drives the whole relay for a CLI
process's lifetime (:func:`run_relay`, via the iterative :func:`_drive`, a
plain ``while`` loop -- not two functions calling each other, which is
still unbounded recursion in Python even split across functions). A
dedicated reader thread does nothing but
turn ``DispatchClient.stream_events()`` SSE frames into items on a queue;
every actual board mutation -- the event-woken re-fetch, the long
reconcile, the local recompute tick, and the transient-failure poll
fallback -- runs one-at-a-time inside that same control loop. A
single-threaded control loop needs no explicit lock to serialize those
writers against each other (there is only ever one of them running at a
time, by construction), and an event that arrives while a fetch is in
flight is simply not read off the queue until the fetch finishes -- so it
is picked up on the very next loop iteration, which is exactly the
"trailing dirty flag" behavior the design document describes, without a
separate flag to get wrong. Reconnects are iterative, not recursive
(:func:`_event_loop`/:func:`_reconnect_loop` each return a plain result
object instead of calling each other directly), so a channel that
reconnects many times over a long process lifetime never grows the Python
call stack.

    Both checks matter for the same zero-downtime cutover, at two different

    is busy fetching or sleeping (the control loop already coalesces
    repeats it *reads*, via its debounce drain, but nothing previously
    bounded how many could pile up before being read). ``ready``/
    ``disconnected`` control items are never coalesced, capped, or dropped
    -- :meth:`put_control` unconditionally appends every call, and every
    item (event or control) is delivered in the order it was enqueued.

    Popping an item and clearing the event-pending flag (when that item is

    :meth:`put_event` takes to check-and-append closes that window: a
