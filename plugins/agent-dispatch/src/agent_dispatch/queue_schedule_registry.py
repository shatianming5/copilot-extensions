"""``TaskQueue`` mixin: schedule registry, supervisor registrations, schedule
job-leases, and external producer resource reservations.

Extracted from :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue` (Phase 10 componentization,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability`` #2423) as the next
natural table cluster after the CLI-command split that produced
``loop_commands.py``: these four concerns (recurring schedules, supervisor
registrations, single-producer job-leases, and external resource
reservations) share no state with the task/spawn/routing machinery in
``queue.py`` beyond the connection helper and the shared record dataclasses,
and none of them is monkeypatched by name anywhere in the test suite -- so
this is a plain mixin, not a proxy-forwarding split like
``loop_commands.py``'s CLI helpers.

:class:`ScheduleRegistrationMixin` is composed into
:class:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue` via multiple inheritance; it relies
on ``self._connect()`` and ``self._now()`` from that class and is not
usable standalone.

``TaskError``/``ScheduleRecord``/``ScheduleLease``/``ResourceReservation``
live in :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue_records`, a small module with no
dependency on either ``queue.py`` or this one, so both can import them as
ordinary top-level names -- no circular import, and (unlike an earlier
version of this module that fetched them back from ``queue`` via a lazy,
function-local import) no runtime-introspection gap: ``typing.get_type_hints``
on any method below resolves cleanly.
