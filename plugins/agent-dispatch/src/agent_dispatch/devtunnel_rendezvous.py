"""The **Dev Tunnels** federation rendezvous backend -- Phase 4 of the
``agent-dispatch-federation`` effort (the work-environment / single-user
counterpart to Phase 3's Gateway-hosted backend).

Where :class:`~agent_dispatch.federation.CoordinatorRendezvous` (Phase 3) needs
a coordinator to be reachable at a stable URL, a locked-down single-user work
environment has no such stable front -- but it does have **Microsoft Dev
Tunnels**: an Azure-relay, outbound-only, Entra-authed, single-user-by-default
directory+transport the operator doesn't self-host. ``dtssh`` (the dotfiles
`agent-ssh` plugin's transport) already proved the enumerate-then-connect
pattern this backend reuses: publish a small, portless, labeled Dev Tunnel per
federating instance, carry the directory entry in its JSON ``description``,
and enumerate by label to read the fleet.

This module implements the same :class:`~agent_dispatch.federation.Rendezvous`
Protocol as the Phase-3 backend -- nothing above the interface (the fenced
lease, the :class:`~agent_dispatch.federation_runner.FederationRunner`) changes
when this backend is swapped in; only the *transport* differs.

**Single-user boundary (by construction, not policy):** ``devtunnel list``
only ever enumerates tunnels owned by the CLI's own logged-in Dev Tunnels
account, so cross-account/foreign-instance leakage is not something this
backend can get wrong -- it is a substrate property, not an enforced check.

**Liveness is directory-level, not tunnel-level:** the underlying Dev Tunnel
object persists for its configured ``--expiration`` (renewed on every
heartbeat) independent of whether the owning process is alive, so an entry is
only considered *live* when its embedded ``last_seen`` timestamp is fresher
than ``ttl_seconds`` -- the same TTL-reap vocabulary
:class:`~agent_dispatch.satellites.FleetDirectory` uses for the Phase-3
backend. A stale tunnel is not deleted here (that would race a
still-registering peer); ``reap_stale`` is an explicit opt-in for a caller
that wants to garbage-collect old entries.

**Enumeration backs off on repeated failure:** every enumeration path
(:meth:`DevTunnelRendezvous._list_tunnels` for
:meth:`~DevTunnelRendezvous.discover_peers`;
:meth:`DevTunnelRendezvous._list_tunnels_fresh` for
:meth:`~DevTunnelRendezvous.discover_coordinator` and
:meth:`~DevTunnelRendezvous.reap_stale`) shares one backoff timer that
doubles on each consecutive ``devtunnel list`` failure (a lapsed
``dtssh login`` being the common case) up to a cap, so a persistent failure
does not re-invoke the CLI at the federation runner's full tick rate. **What
differs is what each caller does while backed off:**

- ``discover_peers`` (awareness plane) serves the last successfully
  enumerated snapshot -- a degraded but harmless stale presence picture.
- ``discover_coordinator`` (**claim plane** --
  :class:`~agent_dispatch.lease.CoordinatorLease` takes ``None`` as license to
  take over) raises :class:`DevTunnelError` **without even attempting the
  CLI call** while backed off, rather than answering from stale/cached data:
  a backed-off node's *own* enumeration outage says nothing about whether the
  real coordinator is actually gone, and its own ``register``/``heartbeat``
  calls are a *separate*, unbacked-off path that could still succeed --
  serving a stale "no coordinator" reply here would let it register itself
  as coordinator anyway, producing two simultaneous coordinators.
- ``reap_stale`` (maintenance) always attempts a **fresh** enumeration,
  ignoring the backoff timer entirely -- deciding what to delete from a
  stale snapshot is a correctness bug in its own right (a tunnel that looked
  dead when last cached may have since refreshed), independent of the
  runner-tick-rate concern the timer otherwise protects against.
