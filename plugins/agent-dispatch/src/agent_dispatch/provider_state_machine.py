"""Declarative transition tables for the provider/PR-target state machine.

This module is the Phase 9 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability/phase-9-state-machine-architecture.md``)
provider machine made real, following the same shape
:mod:`agent_dispatch.task_state_machine` used for the task machine: name
every legal transition once, as data, tagged with the recovery mode it is
classified under, so the shape is checkable independent of any adapter
that executes it.

Unlike the task machine, there is no pre-existing runtime enum to source
states from -- this module *is* the first declaration of the provider
machine's shape. Two consequences follow directly from that:

- The provider/PR-target's observable state is **two independent
  dimensions**, not one flat enum. Approval status and mergeability move on
  their own schedules (a PR can gain an approval while checks are still
  running, or fail checks after already being approved) -- flattening them
  into a single combined state would make the reachability check assert
  nothing but "the cross product was declared," not a real invariant.
  ``ApprovalStatus`` and ``Mergeability`` are therefore each their own
  small declared machine below, each independently reachable and exit-
  checked.
- **Hold is a set of flags, not a state.** Draft, WIP, and blocking-review-
  thread holds can co-occur and clear independently of both dimensions
  above (e.g. a PR can be simultaneously approved, clean, and still a
  draft). Modeling hold as a third state dimension would multiply the
  state space without adding a real transition to check, so it is declared
  as a ``HoldReason`` flag set plus a pure predicate
  (:func:`merge_blocked_by_hold`) instead.

Both sub-machines reuse the task machine's :class:`RecoveryMode` taxonomy
(Phase 9: self-recovering / safe-retry / self-repair) rather than
redeclaring it, so the taxonomy stays one vocabulary across all three
machines this phase defines.

This module also declares the **per-provider capability table**: who may
approve/merge, what notification fidelity a provider offers per event
type, and which conflict-handling policy applies. The default conflict
policy is **hand-back** (Phase 9's resolution of Phase 8's open conflict-
handling question) -- a repository must explicitly opt into the
branch-mutating (rebase + force-push) policy via
:data:`REPOSITORY_OVERRIDES`.

This module declares transitions and capabilities; it does not implement a
live adapter for any provider. Its purpose is to make the machine's shape
and the capability table checkable, and to give the Phase 9 simulation
track a declared table to drive against once it is built.
