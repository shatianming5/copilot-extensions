"""``TaskQueue`` mixin: atomic spawn-reservation lifecycle (the
spawn-at-most-once safety model over ``spawn_reservations``).

Extracted from :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue` (Phase 10 componentization,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability`` #2423), covering
reservation acquisition (``reserve_spawn``), rearm/retire/defer/fail
transitions, and conclusion claiming. Verified self-contained the same way
as every prior slice: an AST free-name walk found only module-level
helpers themselves used exclusively by this cluster (``spawn_key``,
``_conclusion_payload``, ``_validate_conclusion_claim``,
``_newer_worktree_reservation`` -- all move here too), and no test
monkeypatches any of these methods by name. The three simple read-only
lookups (``get_reservation``, ``latest_reservation``,
``list_reservations``) stayed behind in ``queue.py`` itself, both because
``list_reservations`` calls ``self._canonical_repo`` (a ``TaskQueue``
helper genuinely defined there) and to keep this module comfortably under
the 1,000-line cap.

``SpawnReservation``/``TaskError``/``SpawnState``/``Status`` live in the
dependency-free :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue_records`, imported here as
ordinary top-level names -- no circular import, and
``typing.get_type_hints()`` resolves cleanly on every method (applying the
``queue_schedule_registry.py`` review lesson from the start).

:class:`SpawnReservationMixin` is composed into
:class:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue`; it relies on ``self._connect()``
and ``self._now()`` from that class and is not usable standalone.

        """Atomically reserve the right to spawn an embody worker for ``task_id``.

        This is the primitive that makes "queued task -> exactly one host embody
        session" durable and idempotent. It is **distinct from the execution
        claim**: the claim is taken later by the embodied worker under its own
        worktree identity; this reservation is taken by the *spawner* (a
        ``create --spawn`` CLI, or the supervisor loop) *before* launching
        embody, so a crash / re-poll / lease-expiry between observing a
        spawn-eligible task and actually spawning it can never double-spawn.

        Semantics (all under one write lock):

        * If an **active** reservation
          (``reserving``/``spawned``/``cold``/``releasing``) already exists for
          the task, return it with ``False`` -- the task is already being
          spawned or its prior allocation is still being released; the caller
          must **not** spawn.
        * Otherwise mint a fresh reservation. ``attempt`` is ``max(prior
          attempts) + 1`` (``1`` for the first), keyed
          ``dispatch-task:<task_id>:<attempt>``, in state ``reserving``. Return
          it with ``True`` -- the caller owns this spawn.

        A prior ``failed``/``settled`` reservation therefore does not block a
        retry: the next attempt gets a fresh key.

        ``allow_suspended_reembodiment`` (PR #2913 review finding): the default
        eligibility gate requires ``queued`` and unowned -- the normal
        pool-spawn shape. A **suspended** task is never claimable (``claim``
        only ever picks from ``queued``) and always retains its owner from
        before suspension, so it can never satisfy that gate at all -- yet
        interactive re-embodiment (:mod:`agent_dispatch.interactive_embody`)
        legitimately needs to mint a reservation for exactly this case. Set
        ``True`` to additionally accept a ``suspended`` task regardless of
        owner; every other check (active-reservation dedupe, exclusive-key
        carry-forward) is unchanged.

        Repeating the call on an already-failed row is an idempotent metadata
        update, allowing allocation cleanup to remain inspectable after body
        release.

        ``force`` is an explicit, audited operator override for a
        ``releasing`` reservation with no recorded ``session_handle``, which
        no automatic exact-absence proof (:meth:`retire_spawn`) could ever
        confirm and would otherwise sit ``releasing`` forever

        ``confirmed_absent`` additionally permits ``force`` to override a
        **handle-carrying** ``releasing`` row once the caller has
        independently established the handle's session/worktree no longer
        exists -- e.g. ``doctor``'s ``orphaned_worktree_gone`` verdict on a
        reservation whose owning task already went terminal, otherwise
        fencing its ``exclusive_key`` forever (copilot-extensions#3025).
        Never widens plain ``force``'s own handle-less eligibility on its
        own -- masking a still-live orphaned worker requires the caller to
        have done the absence check itself.

        ``release_requested`` marks this ``session_handle`` as retired for
        :meth:`reserve_spawn`'s carried-session lookup. Pass ``True`` only
        once independently confirmed gone -- never for an ordinary failure
        where the body might still be alive and worth resuming.

        The eligibility check runs inside the same transaction as the state
        transition (via ``_update_reservation``'s ``guard``), not a separate
        preceding query -- a concurrent ``record_spawn`` attaching a handle
