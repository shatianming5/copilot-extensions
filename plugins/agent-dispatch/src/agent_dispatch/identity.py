"""Resolve the calling agent's identity (machine + worktree) and repo from context.

The only durable agent id a multi-machine system has is the ``machine`` + ``worktree``
pair, and the authority on "which worktree am I in" is **agent-worktrees**, which
resolves it from the current directory (the way git resolves its repo). So
agent-dispatch *delegates* to the ``agent-worktrees`` CLI when present -- a soft
dependency, like the agent-bridge integration -- rather than reading an env var
or re-implementing the resolution. It degrades to explicit ``--machine`` /
``--worktree`` when agent-worktrees is absent (e.g. on a standalone box) or the
caller isn't inside a worktree.

The same delegation resolves the caller's **repo** (the lane). A task belongs to
the repo of the agent that produced it -- repos stay in their own lanes, so an
agent only sees and claims tasks for its own harness repo (cross-repo *code*
targets are handled by that agent via ``working-cross-repo``, never by launching
another repo's harness). The lane key is a **canonical remote** so it is
device-independent (a shared coordinator keys every machine the same) while the
CLI/UX speaks the local repo *name* via the agent-worktrees registry.
