"""``TaskQueue`` mixin: the Completion Review card's backend
(``confirm``/``reopen_completed``).

Split out of ``queue_lifecycle.py`` to keep that module under its
module-size cap; a pure mechanical extraction with no behavior change. Like
its sibling, this mixin is composed into :class:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue`
via multiple inheritance and relies on queue-owned storage helpers such as
``self._connect()``, ``self._fetch()``, ``self._audit()``, ``self._now()``,
and ``self._transition()``; it is not usable standalone.
