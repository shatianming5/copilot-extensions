"""Registrar ``extends:`` resolution -- recipe references + deep-merge.

See ``efforts/active/agent-dispatch-recipe-library/phase-3-extends-registrar.md``
for the full design (why this sits ahead of ``registrar_discovery.py``'s
``kind``-dispatch rather than adding a new branch to it, the three
reference kinds, and merge semantics). In short: an ``extends:``-bearing
declaration resolves to an ordinary ``kind:``-shaped mapping *before*
anything else sees it, so every existing validate/expand function needs
zero changes -- this module's only job is that one resolution step.

    state instead. **Not reliable for every installed-wheel deployment**:
    the wheel's own packaging (``pyproject.toml``'s
    ``[tool.setuptools.package-data]``) does not ship ``plugin.json``
    alongside the installed Python package, so neither source is

    deliberately not papered over, that only matters once a ``global:``
    recipe actually needs a nested relative ref/cwd (none does today; see
    :func:`resolve_extends`'s lazy call). Deliberately never
    ``Path(__file__).resolve().parent`` on its own: this module lives

    Without this, a chained declaration's flattening loses each hop's own
    path provenance: ``read_declaration_file_set``'s own downstream
    ``_resolve_declaration_paths`` (``registrar_discovery.py``) rebases a
    relative ``spec.cwd`` only against the *outermost* (leaf) declaration
    file's own directory, so a repo-A declaration extending an ordinary
    repo-B emitter with ``cwd: .`` would otherwise run in repo A instead of
    repo B. Mirrors that same function's own absolute-path detection
    (POSIX/Windows, not just the current platform's `Path`) so a `cwd`
    this function already absolutized at an earlier hop -- or one the
    recipe author wrote as a genuinely absolute path -- is left untouched.
    Applied only to the just-resolved *template*, never to the current
    level's own override fields: those belong to the file that is
    currently being resolved, which `read_declaration_file_set`'s existing
    single rebase (against that same file's own directory) already handles
    correctly once this function's caller finishes merging.

    resolved, ordinary ``kind:``-shaped form.

    Two reserved keys sit alongside ``extends:``, never passed through to
    the resolved output:

    - ``params:`` -- a mapping of substitution-only values. Use this for a
      value the template needs purely to fill a ``{placeholder}`` but that
      is not itself a valid top-level field of the resolved declaration
      (e.g. a provider login the template interpolates into a nested
      ``spec.command`` string).
    - every *other* top-level key (the ordinary override fields -- `name`,
      `repo`, `owner`, ...) is used for substitution **and** deep-merged
      into the output, since those are legitimate declaration fields in
      their own right.

    **Chaining:** a resolved template may itself carry an ``extends:`` key
    -- that is resolved recursively, against *its own* base directory (a
    repo-local/cross-repo ref's own file's directory, or the plugin's own
    payload root for a ``global:`` ref -- :func:`_plugin_payload_root`,
    resolved lazily, only when actually needed), before this level's
    placeholder substitution and override merge run. ``_chain`` tracks the
    resolved *identity* of every ref followed so far in this resolution (a
    fully-resolved absolute path, or a ``global:<name>`` string) -- not
    object ids within one template, which is what
    :func:`substitute_placeholders`'s own cyclic-value guard already
    covers. A ref chain that revisits an identity already in ``_chain``
    raises a clear :class:`RegistrarError` naming the full chain; a chain
    longer than :data:`_MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH` (an acyclic but unreasonably long
    chain) raises the same way. Neither ever surfaces a bare
    ``RecursionError``. (This guards the *reference* chain only; a
    top-level declaration file that is itself re-reachable through its own
    chain of refs -- rather than one of the refs repeating -- is not
    separately seeded into ``_chain`` here, since the top-level document
    is loaded once by the caller and is not itself a ref.)

    The resolved template's string fields are filled first (unresolved
    placeholders left intact), then the ordinary override fields are
    deep-merged *over* the filled template -- the declaration wins on
    conflict. Returns ``data`` unchanged (as a plain ``dict``) when it
    carries no ``extends:`` key at all, so a caller can run every
    declaration through this function unconditionally -- but a *present*
    ``extends:`` key, even ``null``, is never silently treated as absent
    (that would bypass validation and surface as a misleading unrelated
    error further down the pipeline).

    A placeholder may survive more than one hop (e.g. a root template sets
    ``cwd: "{workdir}"``, an intermediate hop extends it without supplying
    ``workdir``, and only the leaf declaration finally does) -- the
    directory it must eventually be absolutized against is the **root
    template's own directory** (where the field was written), never
    whichever hop happens to be the one that finally fills the
    placeholder. This return value carries that origin forward across
    every such hop until the placeholder is actually filled (or the field
    is overridden outright by a hop's own explicit `spec.cwd`, which resets
    provenance to that hop -- correctly left for the existing downstream
    leaf-file rebase to handle, same as an un-inherited `cwd` always was).

    **Scope, stated plainly rather than overclaimed:** this origin-tracking
    covers exactly one path-dependent field on exactly one kind --
    ``kind: emitter``'s own ``spec.cwd``. Other kinds resolve their own
    path-dependent fields against the *outer* leaf file/`repo_root`
    entirely outside this function (`reviewer_loops.expand_reviewer_loop`'s
    own `emitter.cwd` handling; `repository_issue_loops.expand_repository_issue_loop`'s
    `worker_identity` resolution via the caller's `repo_root`), and this
    recursive resolver's internal per-hop directory tracking is discarded
    once it returns a plain merged dict -- it does not and cannot reach
    those later, kind-specific expansion steps. Extending a cross-repo
    `reviewer-loop`/`repository-issue-loop` base through a chain may
    therefore still misattribute one of *those* fields to the wrong repo
    today; this is a known, tracked gap (see the effort's own Plan), not a
    blanket guarantee that every field of every kind is chain-safe.
