"""Phase 2: ``force-stop`` -- terminate the exact current live session for a
``started`` task and park it as ``suspended``, without implying or requiring
an operator hold (:meth:`agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue.set_hold` is a
separate, durable primitive -- see that method's own docstring). This is the
"stop it now" verb: an operator-initiated hard termination, distinct from a
pause (which never itself ends a live session).

Session termination is a **best-effort** step: it is attempted when the task
carries a captured ``owner_session_id`` (item 3's interactive-embodiment
transaction, or a headless body's ``bind_owner_session``, both capture one),
but the state transition to ``suspended`` proceeds regardless of whether
termination could be confirmed -- the operator's actual intent (stop treating
this task as actively running) is honored even when the live-process
teardown itself could not be verified. A **local** session (same machine as
this call) is ended via :func:`agent_dispatch.bridge.force_end_session`
(``agent-bridge end <id> --force``); a **fleet** one (a different machine,
per the task's ``owner`` = ``machine/worktree``) is ended via
:func:`agent_dispatch.embody.stop_fleet_body` over the SSH mesh -- the same
generic, unconditional termination primitive :mod:`agent_dispatch.embody`
already uses for a fleet body's own cold/end paths, no new mechanism.

Only a ``started`` task is eligible: ``suspend`` (the transition force-stop
lands on) has no legal ``claimed`` origin in ``task_state_machine.py``, and a
merely-``claimed`` task never had a live session worth force-terminating in
the first place -- an operator wanting to give it up uses ``yield``/
``abandon`` instead.
