"""The federation **runtime** -- the loop that actually *runs* the rendezvous and
the fenced-epoch lease.

Phases 1-2 shipped the pieces as libraries: the fleet directory + rendezvous
interface (:mod:`agent_dispatch.federation`, :mod:`agent_dispatch.satellites`) and
the fenced-epoch lease (:mod:`agent_dispatch.lease`). Nothing *drove* them. This
module is that driver: a :class:`FederationRunner` that, on an interval, keeps this
instance present in the directory and -- for a lease-eligible node -- advances the
:class:`~agent_dispatch.lease.CoordinatorLease` so the coordinator role pins to one
instance and fails over safely (see the ``agent-dispatch-federation`` effort,
Phase 3).

The rendezvous the runner drives is built by a factory over the **shared/hosted**
coordinator URL (:func:`agent_dispatch.config.shared_url`): the hosted coordinator is
simply the stable URL the shared coordinator rides, so the "hosted backend" needs
no new transport code -- it is the :class:`~agent_dispatch.federation.CoordinatorRendezvous`
pointed *through* the hosted coordinator. Phase 4 adds a Dev Tunnels factory as a sibling; the
runner above the factory is unchanged.
