"""Emit a ``running-version.json`` marker for the launch-path reconciler.

``copilot plugin update`` bumps the *installed plugin* (payload) but does **not**
restart the deployed runtime, so a coordinator can silently keep serving an older
build than its plugin. The reconciler (agent-worktrees ``reconcile.py``) compares
the payload version against the runtime's on-disk ``deploy-manifest.json`` -- but
that manifest can match the payload while the *running* process still lags (an
installer wrote the manifest without the process cycling, or a ``-Fresh`` restart
health-passed while an orphan survived). Writing the *actually-imported* version
on boot gives the reconciler a truthful running-version signal, so it can redeploy
even when the on-disk manifest looks current (dotfiles #533).

The file is intentionally distinct from ``deploy-manifest.json`` (installer-owned):
``{"version", "pid", "started_at"}``. A reader treats a **dead pid** (or a missing
file) as *no running version* and falls back to the on-disk manifest -- so this is
purely additive and safe for a service that has not adopted it.
