"""Registrar discovery -- pointers to declaration locations + aggregation (Phase 2).

:mod:`agent_dispatch.registrar` is **pure** (a decoded mapping -> a
:class:`~agent_dispatch.registrar.ProfileDeclaration`). This module is the **I/O
layer** that finds and reads declaration *documents*:

* a cache-populate-style **pointer registry** -- a system, service, or repo records
  a lightweight *pointer* to a directory of declarations in its own footprint, and
  the supervisor aggregates every pointer (vision: *declarative-discovered-registrar*);
* the **in-repo** convention -- a repo carries its supervised work with its
  code under ``.copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/`` (with legacy
  ``.agent-dispatch/registrar/`` fallback), so it lights up on repo-sync and
  winds down when the repo (or declaration) is gone;
* the **aggregation** that reads every pointed location into the declared profile set
  the singleton supervisor reconciles.

There is **one source of truth** -- the declared documents. The pointer registry is a
thin index of *where to look*, not a second copy of the declarations. Persistence is a
single JSON file so ``registrar add-pointer`` (the CLI, a later slice) is a thin writer
over it.

    entirely (the default) preserves the current record's ``owner`` when
    ``location``/``kind`` are unchanged -- re-registering to only add an
