"""agent-dispatch -- a portable agent task-queue + coordinator.

This package currently ships the queue **engine** (:mod:`agent_dispatch.queue`):
a single-writer, WAL-mode SQLite task queue with a nine-state model,
capability-gated atomic claim, and lease recovery. The per-host coordinator
daemon and CLI land in a subsequent slice.

    """Runtime version, resolved WITHOUT a hand-maintained constant.

    ``pyproject.toml`` is the single source of truth. At deploy time the
    installer stamps that version (plus git provenance) into ``_build_info.py``
    (mirrors agent-worktrees), so the running CLI / coordinator report it with
    no dependency on installed package metadata. Resolution order:

    1. ``_build_info.BUILD_INFO['version']`` -- the deploy-stamped value (the
       committed repo copy leaves this empty, so an un-stamped checkout falls
       through rather than reporting a stale literal);
    2. ``importlib.metadata`` -- the packaged version (present for any pip
       install, incl. editable/CI), still ultimately derived from pyproject;
    3. a ``dev`` sentinel for a bare source tree with neither.
