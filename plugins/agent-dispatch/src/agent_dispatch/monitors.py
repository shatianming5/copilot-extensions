"""The **monitor** vocabulary: a suspend's companion resolution handler.

Just as an *evaluator* is the emitter's companion handler for a task's
*lifecycle* (see the parent agent-dispatch vision's §Concepts/*The
evaluator*), a **monitor** is a **suspend's** companion handler for a
*wait*: it names the specific, checkable condition that resolves the wait,
drawn from a small, closed vocabulary of resolvable conditions rather than
an open-ended "suspend and something will surely follow up."

This module declares that vocabulary and its pure resolution logic only. It
deliberately has **no** dependency on :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue` or any of
its mixins, and performs no I/O: every function here is a pure computation
over plain data (a monitor plus a "now" timestamp), the same
declare-before-wire posture :mod:`agent_dispatch.task_state_machine` takes
for the lifecycle table. Wiring a monitor into an actual suspend/wake call
path lives in :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue_suspend` (Phase 3 of
``efforts/active/agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state/README.md``),
which imports :func:`suspend_monitor_columns` below rather than duplicating
this module's pure logic.

Exactly one monitor kind exists today: **cooldown** — a plain bounded timer
that resolves once elapsed, with no other condition to check. This is
deliberately the **default**: a worker that suspends without naming a more
specific externality still gets a real, checkable, eventually-resolving
monitor rather than an unwatched idle. It is what turns a bare "yield the
lane" into a genuine round-robin time-slice rather than a task that can get
stuck forever — see the vision's *suspension-requires-a-monitor* behavior.
