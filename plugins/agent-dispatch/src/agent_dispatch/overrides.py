"""Operator overrides -- the emergency stop for supervised units.

The running set of supervised work is the declared/registered set **reconciled
with operator overrides**, and an override **wins** (vision
``visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`` -- Behavior *overrides-take-precedence*). An
override is a fast, local **enable/disable** toggle on one supervised unit -- an
emitter (stop it producing) or a pool (stop it binding) -- addressed by the
unit's **registration id**. The single supervisor daemon subtracts overridden-off
ids from its desired set on every reconcile, so an overridden unit **winds down**
(the reconcile's stop-not-desired step) and stays down until the override is
cleared.

The store is deliberately:

* **local + out-of-band** -- a machine-local JSON file (``overrides.json``), *not*
  a repo commit + sync cycle, so an operator can stop a misbehaving unit *right
  now* without editing or racing a repo-sync against its declaration;
* **higher-precedence than discovery** -- because the daemon applies overrides
  *after* it merges the declared + store-backed sets, a later repo re-sync that
  re-declares the same unit does **not** quietly undo the override;
* **reversible** -- clearing an override returns the unit to whatever its
  declaration/registration says;
* **legible** -- what is overridden-off, and why, is readable beside what is
  declared (``supervise override list`` / ``supervise daemon-status``).

This module is pure data + small file helpers; nothing here talks to the
coordinator or spawns a process. The daemon consults :func:`overridden_off_ids`;
the ``supervise override`` CLI reads/writes via :func:`set_override` /
:func:`clear_override` / :func:`load_overrides`.
