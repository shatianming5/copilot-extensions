"""Hibernate-the-wait -- hand a blocking wait to the layer so a worker costs
no running process while it waits.

A goal-loop worker often reaches a point where it can only wait on a slow
external condition: a review to be posted, a build to go green, a PR to become
mergeable. Sitting on a live agent session (and its token budget) through that
wait is the waste this substrate removes. Instead the worker **hands the wait
off**:

1. It kicks ``agent-dispatch run --detach --resume <its-own-worktree> -- <cmd>``,
   where ``<cmd>`` blocks until the awaited condition resolves.
2. The layer runs ``<cmd>`` in a **detached, cheap OS-level waiter** (no agent,
   no tokens) that outlives the worker.
3. The worker session is torn down -- it now costs nothing.
4. When ``<cmd>`` returns, the waiter **resumes the same worktree-affinitied
   worker** with a nudge via agent-bridge, and the worker wakes with its context
   intact and continues toward its goal.

This module is the pure core: a :class:`RunSpec` describing the wait + how to
resume, and :func:`run_and_resume`, an orchestration with **injected** runner and
resumer so it is fully testable without shelling out or reaching a live bridge.
The CLI (``agent-dispatch run``) wires the real subprocess runner and the
agent-bridge nudge.

legitimately waiting," and the re-arm loop has no other bound on its own. 3
