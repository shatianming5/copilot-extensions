        For each ``claimed``/``started`` task the owner's liveness is resolved to a
        tri-state verdict and acted on:

        - ``live``    -> leave it (the *same* owner still holds it, no matter how
          long -- there is **no** wall-clock expiry).
        - ``gone``    -> **fenced** transition (owner confirmed gone). A
          **headless** body (a fleet/local spawn-reservation owns it -- see
          :meth:`_active_headless_handle`) keeps the pre-existing behavior
          unchanged: requeue, or ``dead_letter`` past ``max_attempts``. A
          **CLI-embodied** ``started`` task (no headless reservation owns it) is
          instead auto-transitioned to ``suspended`` -- it never silently
          requeues/dead-letters out from under a durable interactive worktree,
          and an operator (or the interactive-embodiment transaction) can
          :meth:`resume` it into a fresh session. A ``claimed`` (not yet
          ``started``) CLI-embodied task has no ``suspend`` transition defined
          (see ``task_state_machine.py``), so it keeps the pre-existing
          requeue/dead-letter behavior too.
        - ``unknown`` -> leave it (resolver couldn't tell, or identity not captured
          yet -- degrade safe; never requeue on ignorance).

        The last verdict is persisted to ``last_liveness`` so the buildup metric
        can classify held tasks without re-probing the bridge.

        ``resolver`` is ``(worktree, machine, owner_session_id) -> verdict``, used
        only for a task with **no** headless reservation (a CLI-embodied or
        not-yet-identifiable owner); the default shells
        :func:`tracking.liveness_verdict` (worktree-keyed, against the bridge's
        interactive live-sessions registry). ``headless_local_verdict`` /
        ``headless_fleet_verdict`` probe a headless body directly by its captured
        bridge session id; the defaults shell :func:`agent_dispatch.embody
        .local_body_verdict` / :func:`agent_dispatch.embody.fleet_body_verdict` --
        the same direct body-liveness probes the supervisor's own headless
        recovery paths already use, so this introduces no new liveness
        vocabulary. All are injectable so tests drive verdicts deterministically
        and the engine itself stays subprocess-free.

        **Concurrency contract:** ``resolver``, ``headless_local_verdict``, and
        ``headless_fleet_verdict`` are invoked concurrently, on worker threads
        from a shared executor (not sequentially, and not on the calling
        thread) -- probing N held tasks costs roughly the slowest single call
        when N is at or below the shared executor's worker cap
        (``_LIVENESS_PROBE_CONCURRENCY``); a larger backlog's wall-clock cost
        scales in batches of that cap rather than growing with the full sum
        of every held task's timeout. A caller-supplied callable must
        therefore be safe to call from multiple threads at once: no
        thread-local state, no assumptions about running on an asyncio event
        loop thread, and no re-entrant calls back into this (or another)
        ``TaskQueue``'s connection. The built-in defaults (subprocess-based
        bridge/SSH probes) already satisfy this; they open no shared state
        across calls.

        **Fencing:** liveness is probed **outside** the write lock, then each gone
        task is transitioned under a short transaction with a conditional update
        on ``(id, status, owner_session_id, generation)`` -- so if the owner
        registered, resumed, completed, or the task was re-claimed between probe
        and write, the update **no-ops** (no double-execution, no clobber).

          hasn't started yet is never reaped -- mirrors the liveness GC's refusal

        reaps nothing -- never act on ignorance, exactly like the ``unknown``
        liveness verdict. **Fenced:** each abandon is conditional on ``(id,
        status, generation)``, so a task claimed/consumed between the read and the
        write no-ops (no clobber of freshly-picked-up work).

        In a healthy system tasks are short-lived; a growing, undraining backlog
        is a system-health signal that warrants attention (see the vision's
        *buildup-is-a-health-signal*). This surfaces the raw numbers -- it takes
        **no** action (escalate-or-demote is a consumer policy, not the
        engine). Reports, scoped to ``repo`` when given:

        - ``queued`` / ``proposed`` / ``held`` / ``suspended`` /
          ``dead_letter`` -- counts by phase.
        - ``oldest_queued_age`` -- seconds the oldest ``queued`` task has waited
          (``None`` when empty), the clearest "is it draining?" beat.
        - ``held_live`` / ``held_gone`` / ``held_unknown`` -- held tasks broken out
          by the **last GC liveness verdict** (a held task not yet reconciled
          counts as ``unknown``). A ``gone`` owner is requeued immediately, so the
          real backlog signal is ``held_live`` -- a live owner that has stopped
          progressing.
        - ``oldest_held_live_age`` -- seconds since the oldest **live**-owned held
          task last made progress (``last_seen_at``), i.e. the *stuck-but-alive*
