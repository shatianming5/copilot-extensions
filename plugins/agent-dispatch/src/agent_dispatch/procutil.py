"""Process-spawn helpers shared across the worker-spawn backends.

The coordinator / supervisor runs windowless -- under the installed service
(a hidden Windows Scheduled Task launched via ``conhost --headless``) or inside
the agent-bridge daemon. When such a windowless parent shells out to a *console*
launcher -- the ``agent-bridge`` / ``agent-worktrees`` ``.cmd`` binstubs (which
re-exec ``python.exe``) or ``ssh.exe`` -- Windows allocates a fresh console
window for the child, which **flashes on screen once per worker spawn**.

:func:`run_background_capture` launches a short-lived process tree with captured
stdio. On Windows its root must be a console-subsystem executable and receives
``CREATE_NO_WINDOW``. That mode keeps descendant console programs on the same
windowless process tree instead of letting each invoke Windows Default Terminal.
Do not substitute ``pythonw.exe``: Windows ignores ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` for GUI
applications, and a detached GUI parent leaves console descendants free to
allocate their own consoles.

    On Windows, a plain ``proc.kill()`` (what a bare ``subprocess.run(timeout=)``
    does on ``TimeoutExpired``) only terminates the immediate child. A venv
    ``python.exe`` launcher is a console-subsystem stub that re-execs the base
    interpreter as a NEW child process (Windows has no true ``exec``) -- so
    killing the launcher leaves that re-exec'd grandchild running indefinitely,
    each with its own ``conhost.exe``. ``taskkill /T`` walks the process tree by
    parent PID and kills it as a unit, which reaps the grandchild too. POSIX
    uses the process-group kill this proc's session leader owns (see
    :func:`_process_tree_kwargs`).

    Never short-circuits on ``proc.poll() is not None`` (the immediate leader
    having already exited): a descendant that inherited the group/session but
    outlived its leader -- notably one still holding the leader's stdout/
    stderr pipe open, the exact case that leaves a caller's ``communicate()``
    blocked past its own timeout -- would otherwise be left running
    untouched. POSIX uses ``pid`` directly as the process-group id rather
    than ``os.getpgid(pid)``: ``start_new_session=True`` (see
    :func:`_process_tree_kwargs`) makes the spawned leader both its session
    *and* process-group leader, so by POSIX definition its pgid always
    equals its own pid -- a fact that holds even once the leader itself has
    fully exited and been reaped, whereas ``os.getpgid(pid)`` requires a
    still-live process with that exact pid to resolve and raises
    ``ProcessLookupError`` the instant it is gone.

    After signaling, POSIX actively polls for the whole *group* (every
    member, not just the leader ``proc`` itself) to disappear before
    considering ``grace`` elapsed and escalating to ``SIGKILL``: waiting
    only on ``proc`` -- already-exited or not -- returns as soon as the
    leader is reaped regardless of surviving descendants, which would
    silently skip the escalation this function's own tree-reaping contract
    promises. On Windows, ``taskkill /T`` is still attempted for the same
    already-exited-leader reason, though a fully leader-independent
    guarantee there needs a Job Object handle (tracked as a known residual
    gap, not silently claimed solved).

    ``expected_start_token``, when supplied by the caller (captured via
    ``companion.process_start_token(proc.pid)`` immediately after spawning,
    before any possibility of PID reuse), fences every signal below against
    a stale/reused PID: a PID-based kill (`os.killpg`/`taskkill /PID`) can
    never rule out the recorded PID having since been reassigned to an
    unrelated process -- especially likely here, since this function is
    only ever called well after spawn (on a timeout), giving the original
    process ample time to have already exited and its PID been recycled.
    A definitively *different* current token refuses to signal at all;
    an indeterminate token (unqueryable, or the process already gone)
