"""Declarative transition table for the spawn-reservation/allocation-fencing
layer, coupled to the bridge machine.

This module is the Phase 9 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability/phase-9-state-machine-architecture.md``
"Assignment: the reservation/allocation-fencing layer" section) made real.
``agent_dispatch.queue.SpawnReservation``/``SpawnState`` already implement
this lifecycle and its guarantees in real, working code
(``reserve_spawn``, ``fail_spawn``, ``defer_spawn``, ``settle_spawn``,
``retire_spawn``, ``rearm_spawn``); this module does not change any of
that runtime behavior. It declares the same shape
:mod:`agent_dispatch.task_state_machine` and
:mod:`agent_dispatch.bridge_state_machine` already used -- every legal
transition named once, as data, tagged with a recovery mode -- **plus**
two properties this layer needs that a bare transition table cannot
express on its own:

1. **The single-assignment invariant.** No second reservation may be
   minted while one is already :data:`agent_dispatch.queue.SpawnState.ACTIVE`
   for the same task, or -- when an ``exclusive_key`` is set -- for the
   same exclusive-key group. ``reserve_spawn`` already atomically enforces
   this under one write lock; :func:`violating_assignment_groups` makes it
   a checkable structural property over a snapshot of reservation rows,
   rather than "true because the SQL transaction happens to be written
   correctly."
2. **The reservation<->bridge consistency relation.** A reservation's
   ``SpawnState`` is a claim about its bridge; the bridge's own
   :class:`~agent_dispatch.bridge_state_machine.BridgeState` is the fresh,
   live-probed fact. :func:`classify_consistency` names, for every
   ``(SpawnState, BridgeState)`` pairing this module is aware of, whether
   it is not-applicable, consistent, or an anomaly -- **any pairing not
   explicitly whitelisted as consistent is an anomaly**, matching Phase
   9's general rule of never assuming the safer or more convenient state
   without positive evidence.

This module also declares the closed "letting go" vocabulary
(:class:`LetGoReason`): every named way a reservation exits ``ACTIVE``
already goes through one of ``queue.py``'s ``fail_spawn`` / ``defer_spawn``
/ ``settle_spawn`` / ``retire_spawn`` methods, each requiring a
caller-supplied reason -- never a silent drop. :data:`LET_GO_REASON_TRANSITION`
and :data:`LET_GO_REASON_RECOVERY_MODE` name which declared transition and
recovery mode each reason maps to.

Deliberately out of scope (per the sub-doc): the launch-to-claim
grace/recovery monitor -- a distinct component with its own internal
state, consuming this module's contract from the outside. This module
declares the contract; it does not declare that component.
