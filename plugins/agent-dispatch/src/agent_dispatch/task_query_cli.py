      shot -- loading the brief IS consuming the baton, so a handoff is marked
      submitted the *moment* it is picked up (the classic quick-baton resume:
      /resume-handoff, a hand-pasted seed). The continuation *work* is tracked
      by its effort/issue, not this task.
    - **Deferred (``--defer-complete``):** approve -> claim -> **start** the task
      (take ownership, mark it in-progress) and print the brief, but do **not**
      complete it. This is the *takeover* pickup: a dispatched/embodied successor
      loads the brief, works the task, and calls ``agent-dispatch complete
      <id>`` **explicitly** only when it reaches the handoff's goal -- so
      ``submitted`` means *the work is done*, not *the baton was handed over*.

    Ordinary transitions are best-effort and idempotent: an already-advanced
    task just prints its payload. A **claim race** is stricter: if a
    concurrent claimant already won it, the payload is refused (not
    replayed) to the losing caller -- see the replay-debounce note below,
    the same exactly-once contract applies here too. Suspended pickup is
    stricter in the same way: deferred mode atomically adopts the task into
    the successor's current session, while baton mode completes only the
    exact suspended incarnation that was read. If either fence loses a race,
    the payload is not replayed.

    **Replay debounce (a *spent handoff* is spent, and a *lost race* is not
    yours).** A handoff is a baton: once it has been picked up and its work
    driven to ``submitted``, re-consuming it must NOT re-deliver the brief as
    if it were fresh. A live-cutover (or any re-seeded successor) that
    re-runs ``consume <id>`` on an already-spent handoff would otherwise redo
    finished work. So a completed *handoff* is refused here with a clear
    stop notice (exit ``3``) instead of its payload -- the single chokepoint
    every task-backed resume seed flows through. The same exit ``3`` refusal
    applies when this invocation loses a claim race to a concurrent
    claimant: replaying the brief to the loser as well as the winner would
    let two successors both believe they are the one continuing a baton
    meant for exactly one. A still-in-flight handoff (``started`` -- e.g. a
    legitimate takeover recovery) is unaffected; only ``submitted`` is
    treated as spent. An ``abandoned`` handoff (superseded by a newer
    handoff, or aborted) is likewise refused with exit ``3`` rather than
    delivered, so a successor seeded with an out-of-date brief stands down.
    A genuine failure to claim at all (no owner, no
    concurrent claimant either) is a real error (exit ``1``), never a silent
    success.
