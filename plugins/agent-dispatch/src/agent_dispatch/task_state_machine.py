"""Declarative transition table for the dispatch task state machine.

This module is the Phase 9 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability/phase-9-state-machine-architecture.md``)
task-machine declaration made real: rather than let each transition's legal
callers and recovery behavior live only as scattered ``_transition(...)``
call sites in :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue`, this module names every legal
transition once, as data, tagged with the recovery mode it is classified
under. It reconciles Phase 1's original reviewer-flavored state list
(requested / claimed / analyzing / awaiting-steer / ready / submitted /
failed / abandoned) with the actual, already-implemented generic task
states in :class:`agent_dispatch.queue.Status`: the reviewer-flavored names
were a specific consumer's projection of this same nine-state machine.

The three recovery modes are exactly Phase 9's taxonomy:

- ``SELF_RECOVERING``: the system's own next evaluation reaches the correct
  state without external action.
- ``SAFE_RETRY``: idempotent replay of the same transition is the correct
  remedy (every transition below is CAS-guarded by ``queue.py``'s
  generation/lease fencing, so a duplicate request is a no-op, not a
  duplicate effect).
- ``SELF_REPAIR``: the system must actively reconcile an inconsistent
  intermediate state before proceeding (e.g. a carried spawn reservation
  whose bridge/session status disagrees with the task's assumed state --
  the ``reconcile_reserving`` class of gap this effort's Phase 5 fixed one
  instance of).

This module declares transitions; it does not change ``queue.py``'s
runtime behavior. Its purpose is to make the machine's shape checkable
(every state reachable, no non-terminal state without an exit, every
transition carrying exactly one recovery mode) independent of the code
that executes it, and to give the Phase 9 simulation/test track a
declared table to drive against.
