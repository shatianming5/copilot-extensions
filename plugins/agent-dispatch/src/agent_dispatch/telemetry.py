"""Generic telemetry emission seam (pluggable, no-op by default).

A small, dependency-free hook for surfacing the coordinator's lifecycle events
as structured telemetry, so a downstream consumer can observe the task state
machine **without this plugin depending on any specific telemetry backend**.

By default emission is a **no-op**: nothing happens until a consumer registers a
sink via :func:`set_telemetry_sink`. A sink is any callable taking one ``dict``
event; :func:`emit` is **fail-open** -- a sink that raises never perturbs the
coordinator. This keeps agent-dispatch generic: it *declares* its telemetry
surface and ships the hook; the publisher (and its transport) live in whatever
consumer registers a sink.

Vocabulary
----------
The coordinator publishes task-lifecycle events of type ``task.<verb>``
(``proposed`` / ``created`` / ``claimed`` / ``started`` / ``suspended`` /
``resumed`` / ``released`` / ``yielded`` / ``completed`` / ``abandoned`` /
``detached``). :func:`task_lifecycle_event`
shapes one of those into a generic **state-transition** record carrying only
lifecycle *state and structure* -- never the task prompt, payload, or any
secret. A consumer maps that record onto whatever telemetry schema it uses.
