"""Loop recipes -- the packaged *shapes* of long-running agentic work.

A :class:`Recipe` is the goal-loop working contract specialized for a class of
work: a charter template (the prompt/goal handed to the worker), the domain
events it **suspends** on, and the **resolution** it drives toward. Rendering a
recipe with concrete parameters yields a :class:`RenderedRecipe` -- the fields of
an ordinary ``create`` call -- so a recipe is kickable ad-hoc as readily as it is
driven by a standing domain service.

The three first-class archetypes:

* **reviewer** -- review a pull request under an explicit landing model: either
  own the merge (``land=self``) or hand feedback back to the author
  (``land=author``).
* **conflict-resolution** -- take the last mile of a PR an automated producer
  opened but nobody is driving: check out its branch, rebase the target in,
  resolve conflicts, force-push back over the same PR, answer review/build
  state, suspend/resume until it lands.
* **goal-driven** -- drive an arbitrary goal against one or more repos through one
  or more pull requests until met or abandoned.

Everything here is pure: no coordinator, no network, no worktree state. The CLI
(``agent-dispatch recipes ...``) turns a rendered recipe into a task.

_RESOLUTION_CLAUSE = (
    "When you finish -- whether the work landed or you are abandoning it -- drive "
    "your worktree to a clean, resolved state: a merged change, or a workspace "
    "reset to its base branch so nothing is left half-done. If you abandon, say "
    "why and reconcile the source (the change/issue you were sent for) so nothing "
    "downstream believes the work landed. You can do this with "
    "`agent-dispatch resolve --outcome landed|abandoned` (add `--execute` to "
    "perform the unwind). Report what you ultimately did."
)

_SUSPEND_CLAUSE = (
    "You may reach a natural checkpoint where you are waiting on something outside "
    "your control (an update to the change, a review, a build). At such a point, "
    "hand the wait to the layer with `agent-dispatch run --detach --resume "
    "<your-worktree> --task <this-task-id> -- <blocking-wait-command>`. Always "
    "pass `--task` here: it atomically suspends this task the moment the detached "
    "waiter is confirmed live, so status stops implying you're still actively "
    "working it (do not also call `agent-dispatch suspend` separately -- that step "
    "is now folded into `run --detach`). A cheap waiter then owns the wait and "

    "competing pull request under your own identity -- not even a 'repair patch' "
    "explicitly marked not to merge independently -- even when their fork or "
    "branch is temporarily unreachable. If you cannot push directly to the "
    "author's branch, leave specific, actionable review feedback and record the "
    "blocking condition (the exact URL and head SHA) as a comment on the pull "
    "request itself; do not open a second PR that repairs, patches, or "
    "supersedes it. Prefer cooperative handling when the other contributor also "
    "runs an agentic workflow: address feedback to that contributor's own "
    "process so it can land the change on its own schedule, rather than acting "
    "unilaterally. Escalate with a steering card if landing genuinely requires "
    "access this identity does not have."

_STAGNATION_CLAUSE = (

    "the same unresolved external state each time, nothing new to reply to, no "
    "operator answer -- do not keep silently re-suspending indefinitely. After a "
    "small number of such non-productive cycles (roughly 3-5), stop and set a "
    "durable steering card summarizing exactly what's blocking you and what "
    "decision you need, with `--request-input` so the task is correctly marked "
    "`awaiting_steer` (a card without a `--request-input` form never blocks the "
    "task, so it silently drops out of Blocked-queue tracking -- this is "
    "REQUIRED, not optional). If you already carded this exact blocker and a "
    "later wake finds nothing has changed, re-affirm it (re-run "
