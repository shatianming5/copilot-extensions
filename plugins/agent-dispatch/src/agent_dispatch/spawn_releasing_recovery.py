    """Force-fail a ``RELEASING`` reservation that never recorded a
    session_handle and has sat past :data:`STRANDED_RELEASING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

    ``reserve_spawn`` treats any ``RELEASING`` reservation as still active --
    by design, since a release/cleanup call in flight might yet succeed --
    and keys that check on ``exclusive_key``, not ``task_id``, so a stuck one
    blocks every future task sharing that key, not just its own retry
    (copilot-extensions#3179). The CLI's own ``reservations fail --force``
    already carries the correct judgment for exactly this shape, spelled out
    in its own help text: a RELEASING reservation with **no recorded
    session_handle** has nothing an automatic exact-absence proof could ever
    confirm either way (there's no handle to check liveness against), so
    without this sweep it would otherwise sit ``releasing`` forever, the
    *same* way a handle-carrying one gets genuinely liveness-checked by
    :meth:`Supervisor.reconcile_reserving` and friends -- it just never had
    that path cover it, because none of the existing gone/idle verdict
    checks have anything to probe. Confirmed live: one such reservation
    (from a spawn that crashed before ever recording a handle) sat
    ``releasing`` for 8+ hours, permanently blocking a PR review's
    ``exclusive_key`` across three separate fresh task recreations despite
    the lane having free concurrency the entire time -- `reserve_spawn`
    doctor/diagnosis tooling reported it
    "healthy" the whole time, since it was never designed to look here.

    Deliberately narrower than the manual ``--force`` escape hatch: this
    sweep only ever acts when ``session_handle`` is genuinely absent (never
    ``--confirmed-absent``'s stronger claim about a *recorded* handle) and
    only past the bounded age above, so a release call that's merely still
    in flight is never cut off early.
