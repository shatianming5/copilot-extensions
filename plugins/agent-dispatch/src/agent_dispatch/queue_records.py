"""Small, dependency-free record types shared by :mod:`agent_dispatch.queue`
and its extracted mixin modules (:mod:`agent_dispatch.queue_schedule_registry`,
:mod:`agent_dispatch.queue_routing_assignments`).

Extracted to its own module (Phase 10 componentization,
``efforts/active/review-automation-reliability`` #2423) specifically to
give the names below a real, importable home that none of ``queue.py``'s
extracted mixins need to reach back into ``queue.py`` itself for.
``queue.py`` composes each mixin into ``TaskQueue``, so a plain top-level
``from .queue import ...`` in a mixin module would be a genuine load-time
cycle; an earlier fix (a lazy, function-local import guarded by
``TYPE_CHECKING`` for static analysis) avoided that cycle but left names
unresolvable to ``typing.get_type_hints()`` at runtime, since they were
never actually bound in the mixin module's own globals. Defining them here
instead -- a module with no dependency on any consumer -- lets every
consumer import them as ordinary top-level names with no cycle and no
runtime-introspection gap.
