"""The task registrar -- declarative supervised-work profiles (Phase 1: schema).

A **profile declaration** is the durable, declarative description of one unit of
supervised work -- a label-gated pool, a scheduled lane, a fleet dispatch.
It is the source of truth the singleton supervisor reconciles (vision:
*declarative-discovered-registrar* / *discover-and-live-reconcile*). This module is
**pure**: it parses an already-decoded mapping (from YAML or JSON -- reading files
and watching directories is the discovery layer, not here), validates it, and
renders the equivalent ``agent-dispatch supervise`` invocation, so a declaration is
a **lossless superset** of the legacy ``AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_*`` env profile it
replaces.

Nothing here does I/O, holds a process, or knows where declarations live. That keeps
the schema trivially testable and lets the discovery + service layers (later phases)
own the file-watching and the running.

    self-contained, autonomous dispatched task (no mux, no CLI-start-prompt).
    ``type=embody`` is a CLI-backed autopilot worktree session (mux, attachable).
    Per-label overrides refine either default: ``cli_labels`` forces specific
    labels to a CLI body when the profile is headless-by-default; ``headless_labels``
    forces specific labels headless when the profile is ``embody`` (a mixed profile).

    ``agent`` and ``charter`` are deliberately distinct: ``agent`` is the

    passed as Copilot's own ``--agent <charter>`` flag on the launched
    session, scoping its tools/guidance without changing where it runs or

    unscoped session at its venue -- this is the case (worker pools with no
    fixed persona) the field's optionality exists for. Whether the body is
    headless or CLI-embodied is a separate, purely operational "mode" axis
