"""Phase 9 reattach primitive (ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2884):
formalize the manual ``create`` (same ``dedup_key``) -> ``claim`` -> ``start``
-> ``agent-bridge resume``/``send`` sequence used to recover a task whose
tracked reservation is dead while an earlier attempt's embody session is
still alive and fully resumable.

Background: a task's ``dedup_key`` only releases from the create-dedup index
once the task reaches a **concluded** status (see
:data:`agent_dispatch.queue_records.Status.CONCLUDED` and
``TaskQueue.create``'s docstring) -- so this primitive is viable only against
an *already*-concluded task, typically one just abandoned for exactly this
reason (see :func:`guard_abandon_liveness` and ``agent-dispatch abandon
--override-live``). :func:`reattach` re-mints the same logical work under the
same ``dedup_key`` (create -> reserve_spawn -> record_spawn -> claim -> start,
so the new task carries a real ``spawn_reservation`` and not just a bare
``owner`` string -- the thing doctor's and the abandon guard's liveness
checks actually read), claims it under the live session's recovery-handle
identity (``local-body:<session>`` / ``fleet-body:<host>:<session>``, the
same convention :mod:`agent_dispatch.spawn_factories` decodes), starts it,
binds the exact session id for liveness tracking
(``DispatchClient.bind_owner_session``), and -- unless disabled -- delivers a
resume prompt so the live session picks its new task straight back up. This
never spawns a new session: it only ever reattaches an already-live one,
confirmed by liveness probe before anything is created.

    Refuses (:class:`ReattachError`) unless: ``session_id`` is itself
    confirmed live right now (never reattach into a dead/unknown session --
    the whole point is recovering a session that is genuinely still there),
    the source task is genuinely terminal (a ``dedup_key`` only re-mints
    there -- see the module docstring), it actually carries a ``dedup_key``
    to re-mint against, and it is **not** producer-managed (a
    ``producer_fence`` can't be safely replayed here -- see below).

    On success: retire the source task's own stale reservation when it
    shares an ``exclusive_key`` with the new one (``reserve_spawn`` checks
    active reservations for that key across *every* task, and an
    abandoned/dead-lettered task's reservation is never auto-released --
    see below); create the new task **pinned to an unclaimable synthetic
    target** (``target_worktree`` = the recovery-handle itself, which no
    ordinary worker ever advertises -- closing the claim-race window between
    ``create`` and this function's own ``claim`` call below), carrying
    forward the source task's full metadata (payload, requires/excludes/
    affinity, ``exclusive_key``, source/origin/evaluator refs) plus its
    progress log and answered steer folded into the new task's own prompt
    via :func:`_recovered_context` (neither transfers automatically);
    ``reserve_spawn`` + ``record_spawn`` (so the new task carries a real
    ``spawn_reservation`` with the recovery-handle as its ``session_handle``
    -- the thing doctor's and the abandon guard's liveness checks actually
    read; a bare ``owner`` string alone is not liveness-tracked); then
    ``claim`` (task-id-directed, under the recovery-handle owner, at the
    same pinned target so the gate matches), ``start``, and
    ``bind_owner_session`` (the exact session id those same checks key on)
    -- then, unless ``resume=False``, deliver a resume prompt via
    agent-bridge so the live session picks its new task straight back up.
    ``resumed`` reports whether that delivery itself succeeded; a ``False``
    here does not undo the reattach -- the new task is claimed and started
    either way, and an operator can always deliver the prompt by hand
    (``agent-bridge resume <session_id>``).

    **Why not producer-managed tasks:** a generation-managed producer (or a
    managed required label) fences creation with a ``producer_fence`` tied to
    a specific producer generation and request id; replaying that fence
    verbatim would silently reuse the old request id, and omitting it would
    make ``create`` reject the reattach outright. Neither is safe to do
    implicitly, so a producer-managed source task is rejected up front,
    before any mutation.

    **Known limitation (abandon --override-live race):** overriding the
    abandon guard leaves the source task's reservation active; supervisor
    reconciliation may treat that terminal task's still-active reservation
    as cleanup work and end its body before an operator gets to reattach.
    The liveness check is ordered as late as reasonably possible (after the
    cheap validation reads, immediately before the exclusive_key retirement
    and ``create``/``reserve_spawn``/``claim`` sequence) to minimize -- there
    is no server-side atomic fence available to eliminate -- the window
    between "confirmed live" and "actually bound"; reattach promptly after
    an override-live abandon.

    The three probe/delivery callables default to ``None`` and are resolved
    to their module-attribute defaults *inside* the function body -- an
    explicit, call-time lookup (not a def-time-bound default parameter
    value), the same fix ``doctor.diagnose_many`` needed so a
    ``monkeypatch.setattr`` on the module actually takes effect for callers
    that don't override these explicitly.
