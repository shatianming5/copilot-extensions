# agent-dispatch

A **portable agent task-queue + per-host coordinator**. It lets multiple
Copilot CLI agents (worktree sessions, bridged sub-agents, scheduled/reactive
producers) coordinate work through a single, low-latency authority -- instead of
racing each other through `origin/master` pushes or needing a dedicated user
account per agent.

agent-dispatch owns the **durable task loop**: queued intent, deduplication,
atomic claims, routing, retries, supervision, and terminal task state. It does
not own generic process/service lifecycle management, live conversational
control of an agent, or the decision to delegate a bounded subtask. Use
agent-bridge for live cross-boundary conversation and steering, and
`delegation-guidance:delegating-work` for runtime task decomposition.

## Install

`agent-dispatch` is a standalone runtime plugin. Enabling the plugin installs the
payload; the session-start hook can **stamp** a binstub into `~/.local/bin` so
the first `agent-dispatch` invocation self-provisions the runtime. Repos that use
agent-worktrees may also machine-gate the runtime and reconcile it automatically,
but that is composition, not a requirement. To install/manage it directly:

```bash
# via the marketplace (once published):
copilot plugin install agent-dispatch@copilot-extensions
# then deploy the runtime (venv + binstub + coordinator service + picker pivot):
bash "$(copilot plugin path agent-dispatch)/scripts/install.sh" install    # Linux/WSL/macOS
# Windows:  pwsh -File <plugin>\scripts\install.ps1 -Action install
```

Agent-facing sessions receive an exact payload-local command through the
session command catalog. That command resolves and, when necessary, provisions
the runtime from its own payload without searching `PATH` for another
marketplace's same-named plugin. The existing `provision` lifecycle remains a
full first-use installation, including the legacy compatibility wrappers and
eligible local services; this adoption changes command selection, not that
installer behavior.

The legacy global wrappers remain explicit compatibility and management
boundaries for callers that do not inherit session catalogs: coordinator and
supervisor services, scheduler/webhook launchers, picker pivots, remote SSH
commands, startup-generated handoff and worker seeds, and committed static MCP launch
configuration. Catalog adoption does not make those callers payload-aware; they
retain their current commands until an attributable launcher contract reaches
each surface.

### Opt-in worktree focus guidance

Repositories can opt into a concise `sessionStart` context kernel that asks an
agent to record substantial operator-led or task-less work before another agent
chooses overlapping work. The project-owned configuration is
`.agent-dispatch/session-guidance.json` at the Git root:

```json
{
  "session_guidance": {
    "focus": true
  }
}
```

`session_guidance.focus` is repository-owned because collision posture is a
project choice. This exact object is the complete schema: unknown keys and
values other than the literal JSON boolean `true` disable the guidance. Missing,
malformed, oversized, non-UTF-8, NUL-containing, symlink/reparse-point, or
out-of-root configuration also fails open. The hook reads the authoritative
`cwd` from a bounded `sessionStart` payload, resolves its Git root in an isolated
Git environment, and emits only when `agent-worktrees` identifies a managed
project and exposes its status core. If agent-worktrees is absent, the plugin
remains fully standalone and the hook emits `{}`.

The guidance asks agents to check `agent-dispatch worktree-status` before
starting new work, resume or claim tasks explicitly assigned to their worktree,
then check `agent-dispatch focus --list` before choosing likely-overlapping
work and advertise their own focus early.
`agent-dispatch focus` is shorthand for writing the same agent-worktrees
status-core summary; agent-worktrees conduct and regular
`agent-worktrees status --summary` remain authoritative for ongoing disposition
and retain their normal cadence. Agent-dispatch maintains no parallel store.

When an adopting repository enables this opt-in, remove any superseded
hand-written **Worktree Focus** prose from its instructions. This coordination
hint is not a safety policy, so it needs no static fallback on launch paths that
do not load hooks, and adopters should not create a duplicate marked block.

`scripts/install.{sh,ps1}` is a lifecycle manager --
`stamp | provision | install | update | status | start | stop | uninstall`
(`init.{sh,ps1}` is a thin alias for `install`). `stamp` only writes the
self-provisioning binstub + payload marker; `provision`/`install`/`update` build
a versioned runtime under `~/.agent-dispatch/versions/<v>/` (published by the
`current-version` marker), an `agent-dispatch` binstub in `~/.local/bin`, a
deploy manifest, the **"Tasks" picker pivot** (see below), and -- unless
`--no-service` (`-NoService`) -- the coordinator service (a per-host local
coordinator, matching agent-bridge).
`update` is downgrade-guarded (a stale checkout won't silently roll back a newer
deployed runtime; override with `--force`).

The installer also manages optional, label-gated **embody supervisor** services.
The primary supervisor reads `~/.agent-dispatch/supervisor.env` and installs as
`agent-dispatch-supervisor.service` on Linux or Scheduled Task
`agent-dispatch-supervisor` on Windows. Add named profiles under
`~/.agent-dispatch/supervisors/<name>.env` (safe names: letters, digits, `_`,
`-`) to get independent
`agent-dispatch-supervisor-<name>` units/tasks with the same env schema; deleted
profile env files are reconciled by removing their orphaned unit/task, and
`--no-service` / `--no-supervisor` removes all supervisors. Put advanced flags
such as `--pool host-a,host-b --origin origin --headless` in
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISE_EXTRA_ARGS`. See
[`docs/spawn-supervisor.md`](docs/spawn-supervisor.md#running-as-a-persistent-service-the-always-on-last-mile)
for the full supervisor/profile contract.

### Same-cell sibling invocation

With an explicit `COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT`, dispatch's worktrees/bridge
`list[str]` launch prefixes enter the packaged `agent_dispatch/peer_launch.py`
native child boundary. It validates dispatch, the namespace, and the peer using
the canonical installation-context primitive, then checks the peer's own shipped
governance API and calls its `scripts/resolve-runtime.{sh,ps1}`. Runtime selection
belongs to that peer, including completion-marker and last-known-good semantics;
dispatch does not reconstruct a slot resolver or require exemplar-only
`.runtime-slot-completion` receipts from generic runtime peers. Dispatch's
resident loop-governance rechecks use the same packaged canonical primitive,
without loading code through a deploy-manifest payload pointer.

The boundary rebinds `COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT` to the peer's `install.json`,
`COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` and its plugin-specific payload root to the peer payload,
and runtime/config routing to the peer installation. The entire `AGENT_DISPATCH_`
environment namespace is removed, including credentials and endpoint routing,
along with generic/sibling root overrides and Python import overrides. Peer code runs under
isolated native Python with UTF-8 and inherited stdio. User argv, including seed
JSON, quotes, empty strings, and shell metacharacters, never enters a shell:
PowerShell 5.1 or POSIX shell executes only a constant, read-only resolver probe.

Receipt/governance failures report a diagnostic and exit 126 before running peer
code, even if the dispatch install root points at legacy. Missing runtimes fail
without provisioning, activating, or starting services. Validation is repeated
at invocation time so a previously constructed prefix cannot bypass deactivation.
Without an explicit context, the historical home-root resolver and POSIX PATH
fallback are unchanged, including their argv and environment behavior.

### Worktree-picker "Tasks" pivot

The installer drops a pivot manifest at
`~/.agent-worktrees/pivots/agent-dispatch.json` so the agent-worktrees Textual
picker grows a **Tasks** pivot (between Worktrees and Maintenance). It renders the
status-grouped board through the stdlib-only `agent-dispatch-board` API client
(Blocked / Proposed / Started / Queued / Suspended / recently terminal). A separate **ACTIVE** badge appears only
when embodiment tracking reports an assigned agent executing a turn; **STALLED**
marks a running turn with no recent activity. That execution badge is independent
from lifecycle phase -- `Started` alone never implies a live agent. The
background supervisor publishes this observation into coordinator-owned task
state; the board client is a sub-second coordinator API read and expires
observations older than 90 seconds, so the Picker never shells to
agent-worktrees or agent-bridge. Enter
opens a per-task action sub-menu. The seam is a filesystem manifest registry,
not a Python import -- the plugins live in separate venvs -- so a stale or absent
picker simply ignores it. Source: `pivots/agent-dispatch.json`.

The manifest declares `"stream": true, "subscribe": true` (pivot-streaming-
transport Phase 1): the Picker runs `agent-dispatch-board --stream` instead of
the plain one-shot call, consuming a line-delimited NDJSON envelope
(`begin`/`row`/`done`) so the board paints progressively, then holds that
channel open -- every two seconds (`--interval`, `board_cli.py`'s
`DEFAULT_SUBSCRIBE_INTERVAL`) the board is re-fetched in-process and diffed
against the last snapshot, emitting `delta`/`removed` frames so an open pivot
updates live without re-invoking the CLI per refresh. Falls back automatically
to the plain one-shot JSON call on an older `agent-dispatch-board` that
doesn't understand `--stream` (`stream` is "always safe to declare" per the
Picker's own contract); a held channel that drops mid-session reconnects with
bounded backoff rather than freezing (the Picker-owned `subscribe` EOF/
reconnect contract -- see `worktree-manager`'s `tasks.py`).

### Declared lifecycle tier (per `docs/patterns/service-lifecycle-supervision.md`)

- **Default tier: 2 — scheduled activation**, layered around a tier-1
  user-mode ensure path — **partially realized today, one gap found and
  filed** (#2524, not yet fixed): the coordinator's Windows `Invoke-Start`
  already falls back to a direct detached launch when no Scheduled Task is
  registered (fixed for #3602), but the POSIX `do_start` still hard-fails
  when the systemd unit isn't installed/available, with no direct-launch
  fallback (unlike agent-bridge's own `do_start`). Until #2524 lands, POSIX
  `start` is effectively tier-2-only, not tier-1-convergent.
- **Availability promise:** starts with the user's session; restarts at
  logon; does not survive full logout or start before login.
- **Windows:** Scheduled Task `agent-dispatch`, `AtLogOn`, non-elevated;
  the embody supervisor(s) register their own named tasks the same way.
- **POSIX:** systemd **user** unit `agent-dispatch.service` (no system-level
  unit); supervisor profiles register their own named units.
- **No escalation:** no tier-3/tier-4 requirement has been identified for
  the standalone per-host coordinator.

### Running the coordinator as a service

On the host that *is* a coordinator, the service is installed by default
(`install`/`update` above). To manage it explicitly, or install only the client
on a machine that points at a remote coordinator:

```bash
# Linux/WSL -- a systemd user unit (installed by default; --no-service to skip):
bash "$(copilot plugin path agent-dispatch)/scripts/install.sh" status   # or start | stop
systemctl --user status agent-dispatch          # manage it directly
# edit ~/.agent-dispatch/service.env (host/port/token), then: systemctl --user restart agent-dispatch
```

```powershell
# Windows -- a Scheduled Task (starts at logon; installed by default):
pwsh -File <plugin>\scripts\install.ps1 -Action status   # or start | stop
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName agent-dispatch | Get-ScheduledTaskInfo   # manage it
# edit %USERPROFILE%\.agent-dispatch\service.env, then: Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName agent-dispatch
```

Both read an editable `service.env` (host/port/db/client token/control token)
beside the runtime. A
client-only machine installs with `--no-service` (`-NoService`) and points
`AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` at the coordinator host.

The service uses the local-endpoint-discovery pattern: by default `serve` binds
loopback on an OS-assigned port, writes `~/.agent-dispatch/run/endpoint.json`,
and publishes the active generation in the zdd routing table for graceful
cutover. Set `AGENT_DISPATCH_PORT` only when you deliberately need a fixed
legacy port; clients resolve `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` first, then the routing table /
rendezvous file, then the legacy `127.0.0.1:9847` fallback.

## Why

A queue needs an **atomic leased claim** to be a correct coordinator: two agents
must never both "win" the same task, and a crashed agent must not hold work
forever. Git and issue trackers give neither cheaply. `agent-dispatch` provides
that primitive as a single-writer SQLite (WAL) queue, reachable over HTTP --
loopback on a lone dev box, one designated host in a multi-machine system. Same code, one
config switch.

## The engine (`agent_dispatch.queue`)

```python
from agent_dispatch import TaskQueue

q = TaskQueue("~/.agent-dispatch/tasks.db")

# Producer: enqueue a task (or propose a draft that isn't claimable yet)
t = q.create("Add narration track", prompt="segment 42", requires=["logger"])

# ...or a durable GOAL a worker loops toward and resumes rather than restarts:
g = q.create("Drive PR #128 to ready", goal="PR #128 is approved and merged",
             done_criteria="review approved, CI green, merged")

# Consumer: a worker advertises capabilities and atomically leases one task
task = q.claim_one("worker-1", capabilities=["logger"])
if task:
    q.start(task.id, "worker-1")
    # ... do the work ...
    q.complete(
        task.id,
        "worker-1",
        result_ref="artifact/123",
        result={"summary": "completed", "checks": {"passed": 8, "failed": 0}},
    )

# Crash recovery: return any task whose owner is confirmed gone to the queue
q.reconcile_liveness()
```

### State model

```
proposed -> queued -> claimed -> started -> submitted -> completed
                ^         |          |            |            (terminal)
                +-- decline/yield ---+            |
                ^                                  +-- confirm
                +-- owner-gone (liveness GC requeue, attempts++)
started -> suspended -> started
               |                                   (resume; same owner)
               +-----------> queued                (release; replacement)
               +-----------> submitted             (condition resolved)
   (any non-terminal except completed) -------> abandoned     (terminal, permission-gated)
```

- **proposed** -- written but not yet claimable (a draft handoff / undecided idea).
- **queued** -- claimable.
- **claimed** -- held by a worker (may evaluate before committing).
- **started** -- under active implementation.
- **suspended** -- previously started but dormant and non-claimable; retains the
  same owner/session, worktree identity, generation, progress, and card while
  clearing active lease/activity.
- **submitted** -- the worker's provisional completion claim. A task reaches
  this state only when `require_verification=true`; it then waits for a
  whole-goal evaluator (or an operator override) to decide whether the stated
  goal is actually complete or should be abandoned.
- **completed** / **abandoned** -- terminal (abandon requires permission).
  Liveness GC moves a held task whose owner has gone past the attempts cap to
  **abandoned**, clearing its ownership and completion metadata. The legacy
  **dead_letter** value is retained only for migration/read compatibility.
  `completed`/`submitted` briefly traded names (2026-09-25..2026-09-29) --
  if you see a stray `confirmed` status anywhere, see
  [`docs/status-rename-migration-2026-09-29.md`](docs/status-rename-migration-2026-09-29.md).
- `require_verification` is explicit and opt-in. The default (`false`) keeps the
  legacy single-call behavior: `complete` self-attests and lands the task at
  **completed** immediately. When `true`, `complete` stops at **submitted**
  instead, and the task needs evaluator corroboration or a manual override.
- The Tasks pivot is the manual override surface for that gate: a submitted
  verification-gated task can be **Completed** (accept the claim) or
  **Force-abandoned** directly from the picker.
- A **liveness** GC pass returns a held task to **queued** only when its owner's
  **session** is *confirmed gone* (keyed on the captured `owner_session_id`, not
  mere worktree occupancy) -- never on elapsed time, so a long-running live
  worker is never disturbed and a bridge blip (verdict *unknown*) leaves it
  alone. The requeue is **fenced** on (owner_session_id, generation) so a
  reused worktree or a resuming stale worker can't corrupt recovery. The
  coordinator runs GC automatically every `AGENT_DISPATCH_GC_INTERVAL` seconds
  (default 60; `0` disables); `recover` forces a pass on demand.
- `suspend <id> --reason <why>` is owner-gated and moves **started → suspended**.
  For an interactive owner, `resume <id>` restores **suspended → started** under
  the same owner and atomically enqueues its durable wake. A supervised owner
  without a captured interactive inbox instead releases to **queued** and
  settles its reservation for safe re-embodiment. `release <id>`
  explicitly clears ownership and moves **suspended → queued**. Suspended tasks
  do not participate in liveness GC, supervisor capacity/claiming, or retry
  accounting.
- A bare `suspend` always attaches a **cooldown monitor** (default
  `DEFAULT_SUSPEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, override with `--cooldown-seconds`, or
  suppress with `--no-cooldown` for a caller that has arranged its own, more
  specific wait) -- see `agent_dispatch.monitors`. The coordinator's
  liveness-GC loop piggybacks a cooldown reconciler on the same always-on
  cadence: once a monitor elapses, the task is auto-resumed under its
  existing owner (a cold-headless owner's `resume` flips `resume_requested`
  for the supervisor's own pool reservation poll rather than transitioning
  straight to `started`) -- turning a bare suspend into a genuine
  round-robin time-slice instead of an unwatched idle a task can get stuck
  in forever.
- `complete <id> <owner>` is also legal directly from **suspended**. An external
  resolver may therefore record a satisfied dormant goal atomically under the
  preserved owner without waking a process or fabricating an active turn.
- A steer submitted while suspended is stored and either resumes an interactive
  task to   **started** with a durable wake, or releases a task without a captured inbox to
  **queued** for re-embodiment, in the same transaction. A replacement body
  consumes pending steering immediately after it starts. The HTTP request never
  calls the bridge. The coordinator service drains interactive wakes
  asynchronously, retries with exponential backoff across restarts, and uses
  the stable wake id as the bridge idempotency key. Task
  generation, owner/session identity, lifecycle status, and latest-wake identity
  fence stale delivery after a requeue, completion, or newer wake. Delivery is
  additionally fenced by the bridge against the exact captured session. Only
  the active coordinator route claims wakes; short delivery leases let its
  promoted successor recover an interrupted claim without racing a live
  predecessor. Wakes are edge-triggered: the resumed/replacement worker runs
  `steer take <id> --all` to atomically drain every pending answer. Suspension
  is refused while an untaken steer exists, closing the response-before-park
  race. The response
  reports `steer_wake_status: pending`; `wakes <id>`, `/tasks/{id}/wakes`, task
  events, `task.wake` SSE events, and `/health` wake metrics expose
  pending/delivering/delivered/failed/stale state. The steer is durable even
  when all delivery attempts fail.
- A detached `run --detach --task <id>` wait is also durable: the coordinator
  records the waiter PID, host, and start-identity fence. On startup it sweeps
  any still-active waiter records; a confirmed-dead waiter wakes the task with an
  explicit infrastructure-failure retry note, while a live or indeterminate
  waiter is left alone. A subscribed emitter's event note can supersede a still-
  running waiter and wake the task early, with the waiter-generation fence
  dropping any later stale completion from that superseded process.

### Goal-bearing tasks -- a durable goal, not a fire-once prompt

A task may carry a durable **`goal`** (objective) + **`done_criteria`** (the test
for *done*) plus an append-only **`progress_log`**. A worker treats it as
something to **loop toward**: work a unit -> append a progress beat -> re-check
the done-criteria -> repeat, completing only once it judges them met (**deferred,
self-judged completion**, corroborated against a recorded result + progress for a
goal-bearing task). Because the goal *and* its accumulated progress are durable,
a worker confirmed gone mid-goal is replaced by one that **resumes from the
recorded `progress_log`** rather than restarting -- the fabric loses only the
*remainder*. Both fields are nullable: omit them and it is a plain one-shot task.
The supervisor re-embodies a confirmed-gone goal to resume it, and nudges an
alive-but-quiet worker rather than yanking its goal. See the **`agent-dispatch`**
skill § *Goal-loop tasks* and the vision leaf (*resumable-goal*,
*resume-the-goal-not-restart-it*) for the full contract.

### Routing: `requires` / `excludes` (hard) vs `affinity` (soft)

- **`requires`** -- a set of capability or identity tokens (e.g. `logger`,
  `review`, `machine:<m>`, `worktree:<w>`, `repo:<lane>`). A task is claimable
  only when `requires` is a subset of the worker's advertised token set. This is
  how the same capability on two machines gives **cooperative, redundant**
  coverage: first writer wins; when a worker goes away, a liveness GC pass
  requeues its task and the other reclaims it.
- **`excludes`** -- hard anti-affinity tokens. At claim time the worker's
  capability set is augmented with identity tokens (`machine:<m>`,
  `worktree:<w>`, `repo:<lane>`); any matching exclude makes that worker
  ineligible.
- **`affinity`** -- soft preferences (preferred agent/worktree) that order
  candidates but never exclude.

### Payloads (inline + content-addressed blobs)

A task carries a Markdown `payload` (the graduated handoff's asset). Small
payloads live **inline** in the row; a payload over `blob_threshold` bytes
(default 4 KiB) is spilled to a **content-addressed blob** under
`~/.agent-dispatch/payloads/<sha256>.md`, and the row keeps only a `blob:<hash>`
ref -- so `list`/`find` stay lean and identical payloads dedupe to one file (no
external deps). `read_payload()` (engine) / `GET /tasks/{id}/payload` /
`agent-dispatch payload <id> [--raw]` resolve either form transparently; an
external `payload_ref` (e.g. `pr/123`) is left opaque for the caller.
`agent-dispatch consume <id>` is the resume-and-consume shortcut: it idempotently
drives the task to `submitted` (approve → claim → start → complete) and then
prints the payload, so a handoff successor's single command both loads the brief
and spends the baton. A handoff that is already spent, or was abandoned because a
newer handoff superseded it (or it was aborted), is refused with exit `3`
instead of delivered.

### Dedup & scheduling

- `dedup_key` (unique) makes `create` idempotent -- a duplicate returns the
  existing task, so agents can browse/`find` before ideating.
- `not_before` defers a task until a wall-clock time (scheduled creation).

## Producers

The coordinator core only owns the queue -- it runs **no** scheduler and **no**
PR/alert logic. Anything that *creates* tasks is a **producer**: any client that
can POST. Two ship in-box (both driven by a declarative JSON spec, both talking
to the coordinator through the ordinary client):

### Producer creation fences

A coordinator can make creation authority for one producer scope durable and
monotonic. Its canonical identity is one exact **repo lane + task source**
(`repo`, `source`). An optional `required_label` binds the protected pool in
both directions: every task in that repo/source must carry the label and its
fence, and every task in that repo carrying the label must use that exact
managed source and fence. A caller cannot evade the fence by asserting an
alternate source or omitting the source. One required label cannot be owned by
multiple scopes anywhere on one coordinator: label ownership is
coordinator-global, and every task carrying it must match the owning repo and
source.

The boundary is deliberately **label-bound plus source-scoped**, not control of
arbitrary tasks in the repo. An unlabeled task under another source remains an
ordinary task and is not eligible for a supervisor pool filtered to the
protected label; it must not be treated as authorized work from that managed
producer.

Managed scopes are permanent. There is no unmanage/delete operation that can
reopen an old generation; retiring the production domain requires a new source
identity. Generation `0` means the scope has never been managed. The first
handoff activates generation `1`; every later compare-and-swap names current
generation `N`, retires it permanently, and activates `N+1`. A previous
`producer_id` may be selected again at a higher generation, but `producer_id` is
audit metadata, not authority.

Scope transitions require the coordinator's separate
`AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN` (or
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN` for `--shared`). The ordinary client bearer
does not authorize them. The control token is intentionally a **superset queue
credential**: it can authenticate ordinary queue operations and additionally
authorize scope transitions, so it is not a least-privilege producer
credential. Keep it out of process arguments; set it directly, or resolve it
**on demand** via `AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND` (or
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND` for `--shared`) -- a fetch
command (e.g. a credential/vault CLI) so the secret need not persist in the
environment, mirroring `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN_COMMAND`'s pattern for the
ordinary shared bearer. A
tokenless local coordinator still refuses to manage scopes until a control
token is explicitly configured. Each successful new transition mints a
high-entropy `producer_capability`, stores only its SHA-256 hash, and returns
the plaintext capability exactly once in that transition response. Status,
history, events, telemetry, and tasks never expose the capability or its hash.
A transition first proves the required-label scope is quiescent: every
nonterminal task already carrying that label must have matching accepted fence
metadata. Otherwise it returns structured `scope_not_quiescent` diagnostics
with bounded task ids and status counts, without minting a capability or
changing generations.

```bash
# Read-only inspection (returns managed=false for a new scope):
agent-dispatch producer-fence status --repo example.com/acme/widget \
  --source scheduled

# AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN must be configured for both server and client.
# The response contains the generation-1 producer_capability exactly once.
agent-dispatch producer-fence handoff \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget --source scheduled \
  --required-label nightly \
  --producer-id scheduler-a --expected-generation 0

# Hand authority to generation 2; this returns a new one-time capability.
agent-dispatch producer-fence handoff \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget --source scheduled \
  --producer-id scheduler-b --expected-generation 1

# The selected producer supplies its returned capability and a request id.
# Prefer AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY_COMMAND; the raw env value is fallback.
agent-dispatch create "Run the nightly sweep" \
  --repo example.com/acme/widget \
  --source scheduled --label nightly \
  --producer-id scheduler-b --producer-generation 2 \
  --producer-request-id occurrence-2026-08-31 \
  --dedup-key scheduled:nightly:2026-08-31
```

Every managed create must supply `producer_scope={repo,source}`, `producer_id`,
`producer_generation`, `producer_capability`, and a separate
`producer_request_id`. The capability is checked against the named generation
before either a new create or an accepted-request replay; a valid retired
generation capability may retrieve only its exact accepted request, while a
missing or invalid capability cannot retrieve it. `producer_id` only has to
match the generation's selected metadata. Validation, the committed-request
ledger, ordinary dedup, and task insert serialize under the same SQLite write
transaction as handoff, so a concurrent create is either committed before
retirement or rejected afterward. At claim time the coordinator defensively
rechecks protected-label rows against their persisted scope, generation, and
request ledger, so legacy or directly injected malformed rows stay
unclaimable and produce a bounded, one-shot `producer.claim_rejected` event per
mismatch fingerprint. A new managed request that collides with any existing
dedup row other than its own accepted request replay is rejected as
`unfenced_dedup_conflict` before its request id is recorded. Oversized payloads
commit inline first, then spill via portable
atomic replacement outside the write lock; a failed insert creates no blob,
and a crash or compaction failure leaves readable inline content rather than a
broken reference. Cross-machine managed creates carry the capability inside
the SSH stdin envelope, never in either process's command arguments.

The request ledger, not `dedup_key`, owns transport idempotency. Its key is exact
`(repo, source, generation, producer_request_id)`. An accepted retry with the
same canonical request hash returns the same task after completion or generation
retirement; a hash mismatch is rejected. A late request that never committed has
no ledger row and a retired capability cannot create it. A **new request id**
does not adopt an existing dedup row; it is rejected unless ordinary terminal
release has already made the key available for a genuinely new task.

The canonical request hash includes: title, repo, prompt, proposed/queued status,
normalized requires/excludes/affinity/labels, payload ref or inline content,
target machine/worktree/repo, source, origin ref, evaluator ref, dedup key,
producer scope/id/generation, goal, and done criteria. It excludes
`producer_request_id` (the ledger key), the secret capability, `not_before`,
`claim_as`, and the current time. Thus a retry may recompute scheduling/claim
knobs without becoming a different semantic request. Non-finite values and
invalid JSON are explicit HTTP 400 errors.

If a successful handoff response is lost, retrying the same expected generation
and selected producer under control authority returns `replayed=true` and no
capability. Status never recovers it. The safe operator recovery is another
transition to generation `N+2` (the same producer may be selected again), which
mints a new one-time capability.

REST exposes `GET /producer-scopes/status` and control-authenticated
`POST /producer-scopes/handoff`. Both MCP surfaces expose
`dispatch_producer_scope_status` and `dispatch_producer_scope_handoff`.
Transitions publish `producer_scope.transitioned`; rejected transitions and
creates publish `producer_scope.transition_rejected` and
`task.create_rejected`. HTTP, MCP, and CLI return the same structured rejection
code/reason/scope/generation metadata. Events and telemetry are bounded and
content-free: never task titles, prompts, payloads, dedup keys, capabilities, or
control credentials.

This closes the agent-dispatch vision's durable task/outcome and
observable-lifecycle intent while keeping producer quiescence as a generic queue
primitive. Domain policy about when to hand authority over remains in the
producer/orchestration layer, consistent with the fabric's
primitives-below-orchestration invariant.

### Scheduler / timer producer (`agent-dispatch schedule`)

Turns recurring task templates into deferred tasks. Each *tick* creates one task
per due occurrence, with `not_before` set to the occurrence time and a
deterministic `dedup_key` (`sched:<id>:<epoch>`) so re-ticks never double-create.

```jsonc
// schedules.json
{
  "default_repo": "example.com/acme/widget",   // lane fallback
  "schedules": [
    { "id": "hourly-sweep", "title": "Sweep service health", "interval_seconds": 3600 },
    { "id": "morning-digest", "title": "Morning digest", "at": ["09:00"],
      "require": ["logger"], "labels": ["scheduled"] }
  ]
}
```

A schedule uses **either** `interval_seconds` **or** `at` (a list of local
`"HH:MM"` times). Drive it one-shot from any external timer, or use the built-in
loop:

```bash
agent-dispatch schedule tick  schedules.json          # one pass (cron / systemd timer / manage_schedule)
agent-dispatch schedule serve schedules.json --interval 60   # built-in timer loop
```

#### Managed registry + single-producer job-lease

Instead of driving a hand-edited spec file, recurring schedules can be
**registered** with the coordinator as first-class objects, then listed,
inspected, paused, and removed. A **job-lease** elects a single producer for a
scope so one host (e.g. a fleet chronicler) runs the registry tick while others
idle -- *pin-not-failover*: a first writer wins the scope and renews it, a
different holder is refused and the lease is never auto-stolen (reassignment is
an explicit `lease-release --force`). This is distinct from the engine's
per-task claim/recovery; it only picks *which machine* ticks.

```bash
agent-dispatch schedule register schedules.json        # upsert every entry into the registry
agent-dispatch schedule list [--active]                # registered schedules
agent-dispatch schedule inspect <id>                   # entry + next occurrences + lease
agent-dispatch schedule pause|resume <id>
agent-dispatch schedule remove <id>

# tick / serve the *registry* (no spec file); serve is lease-gated:
agent-dispatch schedule tick  --registry
agent-dispatch schedule serve --registry --lease-scope chronicle --holder $(hostname) --interval 300

# manage the job-lease directly:
agent-dispatch schedule lease-list
agent-dispatch schedule lease-show    <scope>
agent-dispatch schedule lease-acquire <scope> --holder <machine> [--ttl N]
agent-dispatch schedule lease-release <scope> --holder <machine> [--force]
```

A registered entry is the same schedule dict, but self-contained (it carries its
own `repo`; `register` bakes in a spec's `default_repo`). Registry ticks reuse
the same `not_before` + `sched:<id>:<epoch>` idempotency, so a lease holder that
sleeps and wakes simply replays just-missed occurrences via each schedule's
lookback window without double-creating.

### Periodic command emitters (`agent-dispatch emitter`)

A domain producer that exposes an idempotent one-shot command can be declared as
an **emitter** and run on a cadence by the singleton supervisor. The supervisor
owns the process lifetime; the emitter loop owns the interval and a
pin-not-failover job lease, so multiple eligible hosts may discover the same
declaration but only the lease holder invokes the command.

```yaml
name: review-inbox
kind: emitter
spec:
  id: review-inbox
  command: [review-emitter, tick]
  interval_seconds: 3600
  timeout_seconds: 900
  cwd: /path/to/producer
filters:
  permit:
    machine: [host-a]
```

Place the declaration in a registrar-discovered directory and run the singleton
with `agent-dispatch supervise serve`. `supervise daemon-status` and registrar
listing inspect it; `supervise override disable|enable
declared:<owner>:review-inbox` pauses/resumes it immediately without editing the
declaration. The command is an argv list (never a shell string); optional `env`
adds string-valued environment variables. `lease_scope` defaults to
`emitter:<id>` and can be supplied explicitly when several declarations share
one producer election.

`agent-dispatch emitter tick|serve SPEC --holder HOST` is the diagnostic/direct
surface used by the supervised child. Normal deployments declare the emitter
rather than wiring cron, a Scheduled Task, or another external timer.

### Repository reviewer loops (`agent-dispatch reviewer-loop`)

A repository can compose its review source, lifecycle evaluator, and bounded
worker pool in one `kind: reviewer-loop` declaration. The registrar expands it
in memory to the same existing emitter/evaluator/supervised-lane units; the
declaration remains the only source of truth.

The loop's `task_label` is always included in its worker pool. A repository
that already shares one bounded reviewer fleet with another producer may add
that producer's labels through `pool.additional_labels`; duplicates are removed
and the loop still expands to one pool with one process cap.

Optional top-level `filters` place the whole loop on one or more machines: the
source, evaluator, and worker pool inherit the same `machine` constraint.
`pool.filters` remains the worker-specific filter surface and may narrow that
placement further; permit values are intersected, reject values are combined,
and an impossible composition is rejected instead of creating a loop with no
runnable worker.

An optional top-level `stale_after_days` adds a reviewer-lifecycle stale-exit
policy to the declaration's evaluator registration. When set, submitted
verification abandons a reviewer task once the target change's last commit is
older than that many days. The timestamp may come from inline reviewer metadata
(`payload_inline.reviewer_loop.last_commit_at`) or, for the built-in
provider-backed flows, from a `payload_ref` like
`github-pr:owner/repo#123` or
`azure-devops-pr:organization/project/repository#123` resolved through the
persisted PR-observation cache. Suspended reviewer tasks also use the same
deadline to wake a parked hibernation waiter instead of remaining dormant
forever. The threshold is per declaration; omitting the key disables
stale-exit checking entirely.

**Provider state today.** The reusable `reviewer-loop` lifecycle is recipe-able
today (`global:reviewer` / `global:conflict-resolution` in the `extends:`
registry below). Its read-side provider observation *primitives* now cover
GitHub and Azure DevOps (provider-backed `payload_ref` parsing, persisted
observation lookup for stale-exit checks, a provider-aware poll observer
helper, and a read-only Azure DevOps PR adapter alongside the existing GitHub
one). The forge-facing webhook receiver and the worker's direct
verdict-posting / merge-or-close action path remain GitHub-shaped today, and
this plugin does not yet ship a live Azure DevOps webhook or poll-service
producer that seeds observations on its own. Gitea remains deferred to a
structural stub only.

```bash
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop setup .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop inspect .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop status .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop doctor .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop disable .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json \
  --reason "maintenance"
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop enable .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json
agent-dispatch reviewer-loop side-load \
  .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/reviewer-loop.json owner/repo#123
```

`setup` validates that the declaration lives under the repository's canonical
`.copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/` directory (legacy
`.agent-dispatch/registrar/` remains accepted), then idempotently adds the
repository to the existing registrar pointer index. It never copies or rewrites
the declaration. The runtime reads the canonical directory first, falls back to
the legacy directory, and merges an explicit marketplace overlay from
`.copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/marketplaces/<marketplace-id>/registrar/`.
`inspect` shows the three effective declared registration ids and their local
override state.

`status` joins the declaration with its pointer, local supervisor scope,
effective registrations, the supervisor's atomic per-cycle child-process
snapshot, associated actionable tasks, pool filters, and failed spawn
reservations. `doctor` emits the same JSON and exits nonzero when it finds a
missing pointer, a declared-but-unserved unit, an unavailable coordinator, a
local override, a task excluded by the worker filter, a task awaiting input, a
spawn-dead-lettered task, or a truncated task scan.
Dead-lettered task entries include the existing atomic
`reservations rearm <task> --permit --reason <reason>` action; doctor does not
mutate task state.

`disable` and `enable` atomically apply or clear the existing machine-local
supervisor overrides for the whole loop. `side-load` invokes the declared
emitter's on-demand command directly, preserving its producer-owned provenance,
evaluator association, and target-stable dedup.
Disabling prevents a new side-load from starting; like disabling a periodic
emitter, it does not cancel a command that was already in flight.
An explicitly conflicting direct registration remains a separate supervised
unit; loop controls do not guess that a different spec should be stopped.

### Repository issue loops (`agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop`)

A repository can adopt a bounded issue-backlog worker with one complete
`kind: repository-issue-loop` declaration. The registrar expands it into an
epoch-anchored periodic issue-source emitter and one concurrency-one headless
worker lane. No overlay or second policy file is merged into the declaration.

```yaml
name: repository-backlog
kind: repository-issue-loop
repo: owner/project
source: repository-backlog
cadence_seconds: 21600
tick_interval_seconds: 60
quiet_period_seconds: 1800
include_labels: [ready]
exclude_labels: [bootstrap, wontfix]
priority_labels: [priority:high, priority:medium]
batch_size: 3
task_label: repository-issue-work
forge:
  provider: github
  producer_login: issue-bot
reservation:
  label: agent-reserved
  comment: true
  orphan_after_seconds: 3600
pool:
  max_active_processes: 1
  body:
    type: headless
    agent: repository-issue-worker
```

An optional top-level `task_contract:` mapping lets a declaration replace
the created task's `title`, `goal`, `done_criteria`, and/or `prompt`
templates without changing the issue-discovery/reservation engine itself.
Each field is a string template with the placeholders
`{issue_numbers}`, `{issues_bullets}`, `{self_config_clause}`, and
`{worker_guidance}`. This is how `global:backlog-triager` keeps the same
repository-issue-loop forge/emitter mechanism while swapping in a triage-only
task contract instead of the default implementation-through-merge one.

The emitter may tick more frequently than the configured cadence, but each
occurrence is anchored to the Unix epoch. A completed task suppresses a replay
of its occurrence after restart, and any nonterminal loop task backpressures
later occurrences. Eligible issues must satisfy the quiet window and label
policy, then sort by configured priority-label rank, creation time, and issue
number. One goal-bearing task represents at most `batch_size` issues and carries
a loop-wide `exclusive_key`; the lane's concurrency-one cap is defense in depth.
Suppressed occurrences return before forge discovery. Unsuppressed GitHub
discovery fetches issue fields and marker comments in bounded GraphQL pages,
avoiding one comment request per issue.

GitHub is the first forge adapter. It reserves each issue visibly with the
declared label and an ownership marker comment before task creation, promotes
the marker after creation, and reconciles its own orphaned reservation after a
partial failure. A coordinator-atomic canonical repository/issue reservation
elects exactly one winner before task creation when overlapping declarations
race. Opaque acquisition tokens fence stale same-owner bind/release calls, and
an indeterminate create response is resolved by deterministic task lookup
before any release. Each token is renewed before a non-runnable proposed task
is created; the task enters the worker queue only after every issue binds, and
a bind failure abandons it. Later ticks retry approval for fully bound proposed
tasks and terminal abandonment for incomplete ones, retaining reservations
until terminal state is confirmed. Losers visibly release their provisional
marker; an exact shared label remains while a distinct loser label is removed.
Reservations owned by another loop are selection blockers and are never
silently cleared.

**Provider state today.** The provider-neutral backlog surface is realized for
GitHub and Azure DevOps. GitHub uses the label + marker-comment flow described
above; Azure DevOps implements the same list / reserve / claim / release
surface for work-item backlogs through its own adapter. Gitea is only a
structural future seam today: a stub provider exists so the runtime has a named
adapter slot, but declarations with `forge.provider: gitea` are still
validation-rejected until a real adapter lands (tracked separately as
`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#4825`).

The configured producer identity is verified against the selected provider
immediately before every mutation (for example `gh` against the GitHub repo, or
the authenticated Azure DevOps surface against its project/work-item backend);
comments from other authors are untrusted issue data.

**Rehearsing a new or edited declaration before trusting it to run
unattended:** `rehearsal_mode: true` (default `false`) makes every
auto-approval step above a no-op -- the forge-side reservation/label still
binds for real (so the rehearsal is observably real, not a dry run), but the
task itself is deliberately left `proposed` rather than promoted to `queued`,
so no pool worker ever auto-claims it. It stays parked across every later
tick (re-examined and left alone each time, not abandoned) until an operator
explicitly promotes it with `agent-dispatch approve <task-id>` -- at which
point it becomes claimable exactly like any other queued task, and the
normal evaluator/verification path applies unchanged once it completes. This
is the recommended way to validate a brand-new declaration end-to-end (one
real occurrence, one manually-approved task, watched through to completion
via `agent-dispatch watch`/`agent-bridge`) before removing `rehearsal_mode`
and letting it run autonomously. `discover` (below) remains the right first
step when you don't want *any* forge-side side effect yet; `rehearsal_mode`
is the next step once you do.

```bash
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop setup .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop inspect .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop discover .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop status .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop doctor .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop disable .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml \
  --reason "maintenance"
agent-dispatch repository-issue-loop enable .copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/registrar/issues.yaml
```

`discover` is read-only. `status`/`doctor` report the last emitter success or
failure, staleness, active occurrence, forge-visible reservations, pool state,
and local kill switch. Forge discovery or credential failures are explicit
health failures, not indistinguishable from an empty eligible set. See
[`docs/repository-issue-loop.md`](docs/repository-issue-loop.md) for the worker
contract, migration sequence, and provider boundary, and
[`docs/repository-issue-loop-adoption.md`](docs/repository-issue-loop-adoption.md)
for the declaration schema reference, the available worker identities, and a
worked example for standing up a new declaration from scratch.


### Registrar `extends:` -- recipe references

Any registrar declaration file (not just `repository-issue-loop`/
`reviewer-loop`) may carry an `extends:` key instead of (or in addition to)
spelling out every field directly:

```yaml
extends: "global:<name>"                 # plugin-shipped recipe (see below for the shipped set)
# or
extends: "./recipes/my-loop.yaml"        # repo-local, relative to the repo root
# or
extends: "../other-repo/.../recipe.yaml" # cross-repo, an explicit path

# ordinary override keys sit alongside `extends:`, same file:
name: concrete-lane
repo: owner/name
```

Resolution happens once, before any other registrar processing: `extends:`
is replaced by its referenced recipe document, every string leaf of that
document is filled from the declaration's own scalar override values
(`{param}`-style placeholders -- see below), then the declaration's own
keys (everything except `extends`/`params`) are **deep-merged over** the
filled template -- a nested mapping (`forge:`, `pool:`, `reservation:`,
...) merges key-by-key; a list or scalar is replaced wholesale, never
concatenated; the declaration's own value always wins on conflict -- and
the result is an ordinary `kind:`-shaped declaration indistinguishable from
one written out by hand. A declaration with no `extends:` key is
completely unaffected.

**Placeholder substitution.** A recipe template's string fields may contain
`{param}` tokens, filled from the declaration's own scalar (`str`/`int`/
`float`/`bool`) field values before the deep-merge step:

```yaml
# the recipe template:
spec:
  command: ["review", "{repo}", "--login", "{producer_login}"]

# the concrete declaration:
extends: "./recipes/review-loop.yaml"
repo: owner/name          # an ordinary field: fills {repo} AND is merged into the output
params:
  producer_login: issue-bot  # substitution-only: fills {producer_login}, never merged in
```

An ordinary override field (like `repo` above) both fills a placeholder
*and* becomes part of the resolved declaration, since it's a legitimate
field in its own right. The reserved `params:` block is for a value the
template needs purely for substitution but that isn't itself a valid
top-level declaration field (e.g. a provider login interpolated into a
nested command string) -- it's used to fill placeholders and then
discarded, never merged into the output. If the same key appears in both
an ordinary field and `params:`, the `params:` value wins for substitution
(only for substitution -- the ordinary field still ends up in the resolved
declaration as always). An unresolved placeholder (no matching override or
`params` entry) is left completely intact, and only a bare `{identifier}`
token is ever recognized -- a template's prose may freely contain literal
unrelated braces (e.g. documenting an expected JSON shape like
`{"decision": "emit"}`) without being mistaken for a placeholder or
breaking substitution.

A repo-local or cross-repo ref is a plain file path (relative paths resolve
against the repo root when known, otherwise the declaration file's own
directory), read with the same suffix contract (`.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json`)
every other declaration file uses; a `global:<name>` ref looks up a
plugin-shipped recipe built into
`agent_dispatch.registrar_recipes.GLOBAL_RECIPES`.

**Shipped global recipes.** Eight named recipes ship today. Four are the base
archetype recipes (`reviewer`, `conflict-resolution`, `goal-driven`,
`repository-issue-loop`). `backlog-triager`, `issue-reproducer`, and
`effort-builder` are thin named instantiations of the existing
`repository-issue-loop` engine, while `effort-driver` is the repo-local
active-effort recipe and expands to `kind: effort-driver-loop` rather than the
forge-backed issue engine. Each recipe covers the fields real adopters already
repeat verbatim (shared exclude-label conventions, the headless pool body type,
the archetype's standing-conduct charter) while leaving everything genuinely
repo-specific (target repo, forge producer login, task label, emitter discovery
command, evaluator verdict-application policy) for the declaration itself to
supply:

| `global:` name | Resolves to | What it supplies by default |
|---|---|---|
| `repository-issue-loop` | `kind: repository-issue-loop` | The common `exclude_labels` set (`bootstrap`/`wontfix`/`invalid`/`duplicate`/`question`) and `pool.body.type: headless`. Genuinely thin -- what the loop is *for* varies completely per adopter, so no charter/identity default is supplied. |
| `goal-driven` | `kind: repository-issue-loop` | The same defaults as above, plus `worker_identity: goal-driven` (a built-in identity: drive the assigned issue's stated goal to completion through one or more pull requests, suspend/resume on external waits, never supersede another contributor's open PR). The standing-loop counterpart of this package's ad-hoc `goal-driven` CLI recipe -- same standing-conduct clauses, reused rather than duplicated. |
| `backlog-triager` | `kind: repository-issue-loop` | The same common loop defaults as `repository-issue-loop`, plus `worker_identity: backlog-triager`, `require_verification: true`, and `evaluator_ref: backlog-triager`. The built-in identity handles the shared backlog-triage shape (classify the issue, confirm it is a legitimate bug, assign priority, apply the repository's own triage markers, and ensure it is attached to tracked effort work before triage is considered complete). The *exact* triage label/body-marker schema and what counts as "assigned to an effort" stay repository-specific and are enforced by a consumer-supplied trusted evaluator registration under that `evaluator_ref`; this package deliberately does not hardcode one repo's label taxonomy into every adopter. |
| `issue-reproducer` | `kind: repository-issue-loop` | The same common loop defaults as `repository-issue-loop`, plus `worker_identity: issue-reproducer`, `require_verification: true`, and `evaluator_ref: issue-reproducer`. The built-in identity handles the shared reproduction-only shape (attempt reproduction with relevant repo/stack strategies, attach durable evidence, and leave either a reproducible marker or a not-reproducible outcome plus strike marker). The *exact* evidence/comment schema, reproducible/not-reproducible tags, and strike-marker convention stay repository-specific and are enforced by a consumer-supplied trusted evaluator registration under that `evaluator_ref`; this package deliberately does not hardcode one repo's issue-process vocabulary into every adopter. |
| `effort-builder` | `kind: repository-issue-loop` | The same common loop defaults as `repository-issue-loop`, plus `worker_identity: effort-builder`, `require_verification: true`, and `evaluator_ref: effort-builder`. The built-in identity handles the shared planning-only shape: take a bounded set of already-triaged related issues (for example a filtered query result or an explicit `issue_numbers` set), group them into one coherent tracked effort, create or join that effort, assign every selected issue to it, and stop once the effort's own tracking artifact has reached the repository's review gate. The *exact* effort-assignment marker and review-gate evidence stay repository-specific and are enforced by a consumer-supplied trusted evaluator registration under that `evaluator_ref`; this package deliberately does not hardcode one repo's effort schema into every adopter. |
| `effort-driver` | `kind: effort-driver-loop` | `worker_identity: effort-driver`, `require_verification: true`, and `evaluator_ref: effort-driver`. Unlike the forge-backed `repository-issue-loop` family, discovery is repo-local: the emitter scans active effort READMEs under the consumer's own state root (`efforts/active/<slug>/README.md` shape) but requires an explicit `effort_slugs` selector so it drives only already-assigned efforts, never every draft in the tree by default. The built-in identity handles the shared execution-only shape: drive an already-assigned effort relentlessly through its remaining PRs and tightly-coupled bug fixes until it reaches archive state. The *exact* archive-state evidence, PR-proof shape, and constituent-issue-resolution contract stay repository-specific and are enforced by a consumer-supplied trusted evaluator registration under that `evaluator_ref`; this package deliberately does not hardcode one repo's effort archive schema into every adopter. |
| `reviewer` | `kind: reviewer-loop` | `pool.body.type: headless` plus a default `pool.body.charter`: a generalized (no `{repo}`/`{pr}` placeholders -- those vary per discovered PR and live in that PR's own task, not this static charter) standing-reviewer charter covering the `land=self`/`land=author` landing models, suspend/resume, never superseding another author's PR, and stagnation handling. |
| `conflict-resolution` | `kind: reviewer-loop` | Same pool defaults as `reviewer`, with a charter specialized to taking a stuck, conflict-producer-opened PR the last mile: rebase, resolve, force-push back over the same PR head, never open a second PR. |

A declaration can still override any of these defaults outright (an
ordinary scalar/mapping override replaces the template's value, same
deep-merge rule as everywhere else) -- e.g. `extends: "global:reviewer"`
plus its own `pool.body.charter` to replace the shipped default charter
entirely, or its own `worker_identity`/`exclude_labels` to replace
`global:goal-driven`'s or `global:repository-issue-loop`'s defaults. For
`global:backlog-triager`, the expected adoption shape is: use the shipped
recipe/identity as the shared generic half, then register the repo's own
trusted evaluator named `backlog-triager` to validate its concrete triage
label/marker schema and effort-assignment convention. `global:issue-reproducer`
follows the same split: the shipped recipe/identity owns the generic
reproduction workflow, while a repo-scoped trusted evaluator named
`issue-reproducer` validates the repo's concrete evidence/comment schema and
its reproducible / not-reproducible / strike-marker convention.
`global:effort-builder` follows the same pattern: the shipped recipe/identity
owns the generic grouping-and-effort-creation workflow, while a repo-scoped
trusted evaluator named `effort-builder` validates the repo's concrete
effort-assignment convention and what "that effort reached the review gate"
means there (for example an open or merged effort-creation PR).
`global:effort-driver` mirrors that split for the execution half: the shipped
recipe/identity owns repo-local active-effort discovery plus the generic
drive-through-archive worker contract, while a repo-scoped trusted evaluator
named `effort-driver` validates the repo's concrete archive-state evidence
shape (for example which archive path, which merged-PR proof, and how the
effort demonstrates its constituent issues are resolved or transferred).

**Adoption boundary and provider matrix.** The shipped recipe library gives a
consumer the shared loop shape and lifecycle contract; it does not erase the
remaining provider boundaries:

- Backlog-side provider neutrality is realized for GitHub and Azure DevOps.
  Gitea remains a declared future adapter slot and is still validation-rejected
  pending the real implementation (`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#4825`).
- Reviewer-side provider neutrality is still partial. The `reviewer-loop`
  engine and its `global:reviewer` / `global:conflict-resolution` recipes
  exist, and the read-side observation adapter surface plus provider-aware
  poll helper now cover GitHub and Azure DevOps; however, the forge-facing
  webhook receiver plus the worker's direct verdict-posting / merge-or-close
  action path are still GitHub-shaped, and no live Azure DevOps trigger/poll
  producer is wired yet. Gitea remains the deferred future adapter slot.
- For `global:backlog-triager`, `global:issue-reproducer`,
  `global:effort-builder`, and `global:effort-driver`, the shared recipe stops
  at the reusable lifecycle contract. The consuming repo still supplies its own
  trusted evaluator registration for the repo-specific schema (labels, markers,
  archive evidence, effort-linking rules, and similar local policy).

There is no path-traversal hardening on a file-path ref today; a
declaration author is already a trusted party for the repo's own registrar
declarations.

**Worked migration example.** A hand-written `repository-issue-loop`
declaration:

```yaml
name: my-backlog
kind: repository-issue-loop
exclude_labels: [bootstrap, wontfix, invalid, duplicate, question]
repo: owner/name
source: my-backlog
cadence_seconds: 28800
task_label: my-backlog-work
forge: {provider: github, producer_login: my-bot}
reservation: {label: agent-reserved}
pool:
  max_active_processes: 1
  body: {type: headless, agent: my-worker}
```

becomes, with `extends:`, the same five genuinely repo-specific fields and
nothing else:

```yaml
name: my-backlog
extends: "global:repository-issue-loop"
repo: owner/name
source: my-backlog
task_label: my-backlog-work
cadence_seconds: 28800
forge: {provider: github, producer_login: my-bot}
reservation: {label: agent-reserved}
pool: {max_active_processes: 1, body: {agent: my-worker}}
```

(`exclude_labels` and `pool.body.type` are dropped entirely -- the recipe
already supplies them; every field that *is* still spelled out is
genuinely repo-specific, matching exactly what the sub-plan calls the
"fields a real declaration commonly varies".)

A hand-written `reviewer-loop` declaration with repo-local emitter wiring and
an inline copy of the stock standing-reviewer charter collapses the same way:

```yaml
name: external-review
kind: reviewer-loop
repo: github.com/example/project
task_label: external-review
stale_after_days: 7
emitter:
  command: ["python", "tools/reviews.py", "discover"]
  interval_seconds: 60
  cwd: "../.."
  task_output: json
  side_load:
    command: ["python", "tools/reviews.py", "side-load", "{change_ref}"]
evaluator: {evaluator_spec: {rules: []}, interval: 30}
pool:
  max_active_processes: 2
  body:
    type: headless
    agent: reviewer
    charter: |
      You are a standing reviewer for this pool's target repository...
```

becomes:

```yaml
name: external-review
extends: "global:reviewer"
repo: github.com/example/project
task_label: external-review
stale_after_days: 7
emitter:
  command: ["python", "tools/reviews.py", "discover"]
  interval_seconds: 60
  cwd: "../.."
  task_output: json
  side_load:
    command: ["python", "tools/reviews.py", "side-load", "{change_ref}"]
evaluator: {evaluator_spec: {rules: []}, interval: 30}
pool:
  max_active_processes: 2
  body: {agent: reviewer}
```

The repo still owns the genuinely local parts (its discovery command,
evaluator registration, worker agent name, and any lane-specific
concurrency/filtering), but the shared standing-reviewer charter and headless
body type are no longer a repo-local copy.

### Reactive webhook producer (`agent-dispatch webhook`)

A small HTTP app that maps three generic, forge-neutral event shapes onto tasks:

- `POST /webhook/pr` -- a git-forge PR event; when **merged**, creates a
  follow-up task (`source=pr-webhook`, `origin_ref=pr/<n>`) in the lane derived
  from the payload's repository remote. Handles the shape GitHub and Gitea share.
- `POST /webhook/telemetry` -- a monitoring alert; a **firing** alert creates a
  remediation task (`source=telemetry`). Accepts an Alertmanager-style
  `{"alerts": [...]}` batch or a single flat alert object.
- `POST /webhook/issue` -- a git-forge issue event (GitHub's `issues` webhook
  shape, which Gitea mirrors closely enough to reuse). Driven by a list of
  independent **rules** (`config["issues"]`) rather than one fixed template, so
  several label-watching backlogs can share one listener. Each rule matches on
  issue `action` (default `opened`/`labeled`/`label_updated` -- the latter is
  Gitea's own label-change action name, fired for both additions and
  removals; a pure removal, with no `changes.added_labels`, is treated as a
  no-op and never enqueues) and a set of required forge labels, optionally
  restricts to a repo allowlist, and creates a task
  (`source=issue-webhook`, `origin_ref=issue/<n>`) with a deterministic
  `dedup_key` of `<task_label>:<repo full name>#<issue number>` -- this is the
  reactive half of a "webhook-primary, polling-fallback" pair: a deployer-owned
  periodic poller using the same dedup-key shape is an idempotent backstop for
  a missed or undelivered webhook **while the first task is still
  non-terminal** (the dedup key releases once its task completes/is abandoned,
  so a very late redelivery or poll after that point mints a fresh task rather
  than being recognized as a repeat).

Every task carries a deterministic `dedup_key`, so a redelivered webhook
doesn't double-enqueue **as long as the original task is still in flight** --
see the caveat above for what happens after it reaches a terminal status.
Behavior (templates, base-branch/severity/label allowlists, the coordinator
URL) is set in an optional JSON config. Two authentication mechanisms are
supported, and `github_secret` takes precedence when both are configured:
`github_secret` verifies GitHub's own `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC header (the
mechanism a real GitHub webhook delivery actually uses -- GitHub never sends
a bearer header); `inbound_token` is a simple shared-secret bearer check for
any other caller (a Gitea delivery, a manual/scripted trigger). Both also
accept an env-var fallback (`AGENT_DISPATCH_WEBHOOK_GITHUB_SECRET` /
`AGENT_DISPATCH_WEBHOOK_INBOUND_TOKEN`) when the config key is omitted --
for a declarative registrar deployment (`kind: emitter`, no `command` key),
the config dict *is* the committed registrar spec, materialized verbatim to
a file; it must never carry a literal secret, so a deployer sets the real
value via a local, non-committed env file instead.

```bash
agent-dispatch webhook --config webhook.json --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9331
```

### Evaluator -- a producer's lifecycle handler (`agent-dispatch evaluate`)

A producer puts work on the queue; a **whole-goal evaluator** decides whether a
verification-gated submitted task is actually done. It is event-triggered, not a
polling audit loop: the coordinator invokes it when a task first reaches
`task.submitted`, when an operator explicitly backfills a named submitted task
(`agent-dispatch verify-submitted --evaluator-ref <name> <task-id>...` for a
legacy row that is not yet opted in, or the same command without
`--evaluator-ref` for an already-flagged row), and when a subscribed emitter's
event note re-triggers a still-submitted task after external state changes.

Two evaluator kinds are supported:

- **Declarative `SpecEvaluator`** — a `rules` list matching on the event/task
  fields and returning `confirm` / `abandon` / `noop`.
- **Trusted script evaluator** — a separately registered opaque selector mapped
  to a fixed `argv`, run with `shell=False` and no caller-supplied arguments;
  the task's `evaluator_ref` names that selector, never a literal command.

For the verification gate itself, evaluators may decide only **complete**,
**abandon**, or **noop**. They do not rewrite the task goal, perform a generic
progress audit, or run as an interval sweep.

```bash
# apply an evaluator to an event read from stdin (a hook/producer pipes it in):
echo '{"type":"task.submitted","task":{"id":"t1","labels":["recipe:reviewer"],"status":"submitted","origin_ref":"o/n#42"}}' \
  | agent-dispatch evaluate --spec evaluator.json --repo o/n
agent-dispatch evaluate --spec evaluator.json --event-file event.json --dry-run
agent-dispatch verify-submitted t1 t2
```

Spec shape (JSON): either a `rules` list, each with `on` (event type, or a
list), an optional `when` predicate (`labels_any` / `labels_all` / `status` /
`source`), and `confirm` / `abandon` / `noop` behavior; or a trusted `scripts`
registry mapping opaque evaluator refs to fixed argv lists. The **degenerate
case is the ad-hoc kick**: a one-off task with no evaluator still runs -- an
evaluator is opt-in judgment, never required. See
[`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`](../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
(§Concepts/*The evaluator*, §Features/*emitters-and-evaluators*).

## Recipes (loop archetypes)

A **recipe** is a packaged *shape* of long-running agentic work -- a charter
template plus the suspend/resume rhythm and the resolution it drives toward. Three
archetypes ship in-box: **reviewer** (review under an explicit `land=self|author`
model),
**conflict-resolution** (take the last mile of a stalled change), and
**goal-driven** (drive an arbitrary goal through PRs). A recipe is a *first-class,
directly-invokable* capability: you can kick a one-off from the CLI with only a
coordinator + a worker body -- no standing service, emitter, or evaluator is
required (the "recipes run ad-hoc" path).

```bash
agent-dispatch recipes list                       # the available recipes + their params
agent-dispatch recipes describe reviewer          # full descriptor (templates, suspend-on, resolution)

# render a recipe's fields without creating anything (inspect / dry-read):
agent-dispatch recipes render reviewer --param repo=owner/name --param pr=42 --param land=author

# carve an ad-hoc task from a recipe (and, with --spawn, embody a worker to drive it):
agent-dispatch recipes kick reviewer --param repo=owner/name --param pr=42 --repo owner/name --spawn
agent-dispatch recipes kick reviewer --param repo=owner/name --param pr=42 --dry-run   # preview the create call
```

`kick` reuses the ordinary `create` path, so it inherits lane resolution, dedup,
and the `--spawn`/`--spawn-backend` embodiment (default `embody`: a CLI autopilot
in a fresh worktree with a full checkout -- the right body for a recipe). A
**reserved-work `dedup_key`** is derived from the recipe target. For reviewers,
the identity is the repository + pull-request reference only, so landing-policy,
base-branch, or guidance drift cannot fork a live review. Once that generation
is terminal, the queue releases the key and permits a later review generation
(override with `--dedup-key`). The rendered charter reaffirms the two safety
invariants -- *drive the worktree to a clean resolved state on abandon* and *report
what you did* -- so a worker carries them even on the ad-hoc, no-service path. See
[`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`](../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
(§Concepts/*The recipe*, §Features/*loop-recipes* + *recipes-run-ad-hoc*).

The reviewer defaults to backward-compatible `land=self`: the reviewer owns
landing and is not done at a verdict. With `land=author`, the reviewer posts and
records its verdict, then suspends without holding worker capacity while the
author owns updates and landing. It resumes on change, supersession/closure, or
an explicit expiry/abandon decision. Tasks carry distinct `landing:*` and
`resolution:reviewer-*` labels so evaluators cannot apply self-land completion
rules to an author-land review.

### Registered emitter side-load

`recipes kick` is deliberately self-tracked (`source=recipe`). To send a single
change through a standing producer, declare an emitter `side_load.command` with
a `{change_ref}` placeholder and use its registered handle:

```json
{
  "id": "repository-reviews",
  "command": ["review-source", "discover"],
  "interval_seconds": 300,
  "task_output": "json",
  "evaluator_ref": "repository-review-lifecycle",
  "side_load": {
    "command": ["review-source", "side-load", "{change_ref}"]
  }
}
```

```bash
agent-dispatch emitter side-load <registration-id> owner/name#42
```

With `task_output=json`, discovery and side-load commands emit one task object
or a list of task objects on stdout. Each object contains `title` plus ordinary
create fields (`repo`, `prompt`, `labels`, `dedup_key`, and so on).
agent-dispatch authors the tasks and forcibly stamps `source=emitter` by
default,
`origin_ref=<emitter id>`, and the declaration's `evaluator_ref`; command output
cannot spoof that provenance. A command emitter may declare a non-empty
`source` to use a dedicated producer identity; existing declarations that omit
it retain `source=emitter`. The same operation is exposed as
`dispatch_emitter_side_load` by local and coordinator-hosted MCP.

An evaluator registration may declare the same `evaluator_ref`. Its service
consumes only terminal tasks stamped by that producer association; supervised
pools continue to select ordinary task attributes and never own evaluator
judgment.

The repository declaration names an acting identity and commands, never
credentials. Tokens remain in the existing runtime/auth boundary. Change
content is untrusted data: side-load/discovery commands must not execute target
branch code by default, and any sandboxed test or `land=self` permission is an
explicit repository policy. An identity that cannot approve or land records a
visible blocked/terminal outcome instead of retrying indefinitely.

### Emitter command receipts (`agent-dispatch emitter receipts`)

A `task_output=json` command-emitter authors tasks on every tick, but the
resulting ids are otherwise visible for exactly that tick and then gone. A
durable **receipts** log records each created task's id keyed by the same
`dedup_key` the command emitted, readable on a **later** invocation -- so a
domain producer (one with its own backing state: a carved reservation, a
tracked work item) can learn which dispatch task its own emitted description
became, and close its own transaction (link the id, stop re-offering the
same work) without inventing a per-domain polling reconciliation.

```bash
agent-dispatch emitter receipts <emitter-id> [--since <cursor>]
```

Returns `{"receipts": [...], "cursor": N}` -- each receipt is
`{"seq", "ts", "tick_id", "dedup_key", "task_id", "status"}`. Pass the
returned `cursor` back as `--since` on the next call to read only new
receipts; `since` defaults to 0 (everything recorded so far). The log is
bounded (oldest records trimmed once it exceeds a cap) and `seq` is stable
across a trim -- it is never reused or shifted, so a cursor from before a
trim still reads correctly after one.

The declared command's own subprocess also receives the receipts path
directly via the `AGENT_DISPATCH_EMITTER_RECEIPTS_PATH` environment
variable, so it can read its own prior tick's receipts with no CLI round
trip. Both the `tick`/`serve` path and the on-demand `side-load` path write
to the identical sink, keyed by the emitter's declared `id` (not by its spec
file path -- a side-loaded emitter's spec lives only in a coordinator
registration, with no local file to sit beside).

### Driving a recipe loop (`agent-dispatch recipes drive`)

A recipe declares the *shape* of a loop; the **driver** is the small state machine
that turns it into a rhythm. `drive` maps a recipe + a `--signal` (what just
happened) to the next action:

- **work** -- do a pass (`start`, or a `suspend_on` event like `change-updated`
  means the world moved and there's something to react to). The agent performs it.
- **suspend** -- nothing to do until the world moves (`work-done` / `idle`): hand
  the wait to *hibernate-the-wait* until a `suspend_on` event fires.
- **resolve** -- a terminal signal (`merged`/`landed`/`goal-met` -> landed;
  `abandoned`/`closed` -> abandoned): *drive the worktree to resolution* and finish.

```bash
agent-dispatch recipes drive reviewer --signal start        # -> work
agent-dispatch recipes drive reviewer --signal work-done    # -> suspend (wait on suspend_on)
agent-dispatch recipes drive reviewer --signal merged       # -> resolve (landed)

# --execute performs the non-work legs on the substrate:
agent-dispatch recipes drive reviewer --signal work-done --execute \
  --resume <machine/worktree> -- agent-worktrees pr-watch 42   # spawn the detached waiter
agent-dispatch recipes drive reviewer --signal abandoned --execute --base main   # run the unwind
```

The decision is pure; `--execute` runs the **suspend** leg (spawn the detached
hibernation waiter -- needs `--resume` + a `--` wait command) and the **resolve**
leg (the drive-to-resolution unwind). **work** stays the agent's to perform. This
is the executable seam that composes recipes + `run` + `resolve` into a loop. See
[`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`](../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
(§Concepts/*The recipe*, §Behaviors/*a-loop-runs-with-or-without-a-service*).

## Drive the worktree to resolution (`agent-dispatch resolve`)

Finishing a loop -- whether the work **landed** or the worker is **abandoning** it
-- must leave the worktree in a *clean, resolved final state*, never an orphan
branch half-done. `resolve` packages that mandate as an inspectable, executable
plan a worker runs on **its own** worktree:

```bash
# preview the plan (default -- runs nothing):
agent-dispatch resolve --outcome landed
agent-dispatch resolve --outcome abandoned --base main --source owner/name#42

# perform it (the abandon path's unwind is destructive):
agent-dispatch resolve --outcome abandoned --base main --execute
```

- **landed** -> a single *verify-clean* check (the merge already resolved it).
- **abandoned** -> *unwind to base* (`git reset --hard` to the tracked upstream, or
  `origin/<base>`), *drop untracked* cruft, then a *reconcile-source* instruction
  (notify the producing effort/issue/PR so nothing downstream believes the work
  landed). The reconcile step is **advisory**: agent-dispatch coordinates it, it
  doesn't post on your behalf.

Planning is pure; execution only runs with `--execute`, and a failed destructive
unwind stops rather than pressing on. `agent-dispatch abandon --resolve` surfaces
this same plan alongside the abandon so the required unwind is an explicit
expectation, not a silent one. See
[`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`](../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
(§Behaviors/*drive-the-worktree-to-resolution*).

## Hibernate the wait (`agent-dispatch run`)

A worker that can only wait on a slow external condition (a review, a build, a PR
becoming mergeable) shouldn't sit on a live session and its token budget. It hands
the wait to the layer: `run` executes the blocking command and, when it resolves,
resumes the worktree-affinitied worker via an agent-bridge nudge. A wait command
exiting `124` (timed out, nothing changed) re-arms in place rather than waking the
worker -- but only up to a bounded number of times (`MAX_TIMEOUT_REATTEMPTS`,
default 3); past that, `run` gives up and resumes anyway with a `gave_up` report
and an explicit "never resolved" message, rather than hibernating indefinitely.

```bash
# foreground: run the wait, then nudge the worker to resume:
agent-dispatch run --resume <machine/worktree> --task <id> -- agent-worktrees pr-watch 42

# detached: the wait runs in a process that outlives this one, so the worker can
# be torn down (costing nothing) while it waits -- true hibernation:
agent-dispatch run --detach --resume <machine/worktree> --task <id> -- agent-worktrees pr-watch 42
```

Everything after `--` is the blocking wait command (its own flags are never parsed
as `run` options). With `--detach` the wait is re-exec'd as a fully detached,
cheap OS-level waiter (no agent, no tokens); the expensive worker session is spun
down and re-woken with its context intact when the wait returns. The resume is a
best-effort bridge nudge -- a genuinely-gone worker is handled by liveness
recovery, not the nudge.

Always pass `--task` with `--detach`: the coordinator transactionally prepares a
new detached-waiter generation (suspending the task in the same durable step),
the child process must then **arm** that generation with its PID/host/start-token
identity fence before it owns the wait, and any pre-arm failure aborts or
recovers that prepared generation instead of leaving an unrecoverable suspended
task behind. A `task`-kind agent-worktrees claim is journaled on the current
worktree as part of the detach flow, blocking finalize/managed-GC from
reclaiming it out from under the still-open task; durable wake delivery retires
that claim only while the same waiter generation still owns completion. These
guardrails are best-effort and non-fatal -- they backstop hibernation rather
than blocking the detach itself. See
[`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`](../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
(§Features/*hibernate-the-wait*).

### Diagnosing a stuck hibernation (`agent-dispatch doctor`)

A hibernating task's session is *supposed* to be gone -- that's the whole
point -- so ordinary liveness classification can't tell "still legitimately
waiting" from "the detached waiter died, or its worktree was reclaimed out
from under it, and this will never self-resume". `doctor` checks the one
signal strong enough to know for certain: whether the task's worktree is
still a live, resumable checkout.

```bash
# report-only: never mutates anything
agent-dispatch doctor --repo <lane>

# diagnose exactly one task (any status), instead of sweeping --repo/--label
agent-dispatch doctor --task <task-id>

# also walk that task's full spawn-reservation history and probe every
# attempt's actual embody-session liveness by session id (opt-in: one
# extra bridge probe per recorded attempt) -- catches an earlier attempt
# that's still alive but shadowed by a later dead/unknown one
agent-dispatch doctor --task <task-id> --check-live-sessions

# unbind + re-queue every task whose worktree is confirmed gone
# (fails its stale reservation, then releases/yields the task back to queued)
agent-dispatch doctor --repo <lane> --repair
```

Each examined `claimed`/`started`/`suspended` task gets one of these
verdicts: `orphaned_worktree_gone` (its worktree is
`finalized`/`orphaned`/untracked -- the only verdict `--repair` acts on),
`stale_lease` (a `started` task's lease long expired with no reported
activity, but the worktree itself couldn't be confirmed gone -- advisory
only, never auto-repaired), `unknown` (no reservation/worktree on record to
check), or `healthy`. `--repair` never re-creates a worker and never guesses
from an indeterminate agent-worktrees lookup -- see [ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2577](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2577)
for the full design rationale. Distinct from `agent-dispatch reviewer-loop
doctor` (a single declared reviewer-loop's health across its emitter/
evaluator/supervised-lane units, never mutating) -- this `doctor` is
task-scoped and repo-wide, with an explicit opt-in mutation.

`--check-live-sessions` adds two more possible verdicts, reported instead of
(never alongside) the ones above: `earlier_attempt_live` -- an earlier
spawn attempt's embody session is confirmed live but shadowed by a later
dead/unknown one (the task's own `owner`/latest reservation always reflects
only the *latest* attempt, which can hide this); the diagnosis names the
live `live_attempt`, `live_session_id`, and (for a fleet body) `live_host` so
an operator can `agent-bridge resume` it -- and
`reservation_history_truncated` -- the task's reservation history page came
back at the request limit, so the check was skipped rather than risk
analyzing an incomplete page. Neither verdict is ever auto-repaired -- see
[ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2884](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2884).

### Recovering a shadowed live session (`agent-dispatch reattach`)

`doctor --check-live-sessions` can *find* an `earlier_attempt_live` session
-- a still-alive, fully resumable embody session that a task's tracked
reservation no longer points at -- but finding it isn't recovering it.
`reattach` is that missing act-on-it step: it re-mints the source task's
work under a fresh task id, claimed by the live session, so it can pick the
work straight back up.

```bash
# task-id must be TERMINAL (abandoned/completed) and carry a
# dedup_key -- see below for why. session-id must be confirmed live right now.
agent-dispatch reattach <task-id> <session-id>

# the session lives on a fleet pool host, not locally
agent-dispatch reattach <task-id> <session-id> --host <pool-host>

# claim/start/bind only -- skip delivering the agent-bridge resume prompt
# (deliver it by hand instead, e.g. after inspecting the new task first)
agent-dispatch reattach <task-id> <session-id> --no-resume
```

A task's `dedup_key` only releases from the create-dedup index once the task
reaches a **terminal** status -- so `reattach` only works against a task
that's already terminal, typically one just `abandon`ed for exactly this
reason. It refuses (non-zero exit, no mutation) unless `session-id` is
itself confirmed live, the source task is terminal, it carries a
`dedup_key`, and it is **not** producer-managed (a `producer_fence` can't be
safely replayed -- recover it through its owning producer instead). If the
source task carries an `exclusive_key`, its own (never auto-released)
reservation is retired first, since `reserve_spawn` fences that key across
every task sharing it. On success it re-mints a fresh task under that
`dedup_key`, pinned to an unclaimable synthetic `target_worktree` (the
recovery handle itself -- no ordinary worker advertises it, closing the race
window between creating the row and this command's own claim), carrying
forward the source task's full metadata (payload, capability requires/
excludes/affinity, `exclusive_key`, source/origin/evaluator refs) plus its
progress log and any answered steer folded into the new task's own prompt
(neither transfers automatically -- they're keyed to the *old* task id);
reserves and records a real spawn reservation (so the new task is genuinely
liveness-tracked, not just owned by a bare string) whose `session_handle` is
the `local-body:<session>` / `fleet-body:<host>:<session>` recovery-handle
identity (a `--host` alias is normalized before it's baked into that handle
or used to deliver the resume prompt); claims, starts, and binds the exact
session id for liveness tracking; and delivers a resume prompt via
agent-bridge so the live session picks the new task straight back up --
explicitly told to pass that recovery-handle worker id on every owner-gated
command going forward, since it won't resolve from the resumed session's own
CWD identity.

**Known limitation:** `abandon --override-live` (see below) leaves the
source task's own reservation active; supervisor reconciliation may treat a
terminal task's still-active reservation as cleanup and end its body before
an operator reattaches. `reattach` orders its liveness check as late as
reasonably possible (right before the mutating create/reserve/claim
sequence) to minimize -- no server-side atomic fence eliminates it entirely
-- that window; reattach promptly after an override-live abandon.

### Guarding against discarding a live session (`abandon --override-live`)

`abandon` now refuses (non-zero exit) when the task's *current* reservation
session is confirmed live -- abandoning it would discard the only tracking
link to a still-good session, with no path back (`abandoned` is terminal).
Pass `--override-live` to abandon it anyway once you've confirmed that's
really what you want (e.g. you've already captured the session id
separately and plan to `reattach` once the abandon completes). An unknown or
confirmed-gone session never blocks -- only a *confirmed*-live one does.

```bash
agent-dispatch abandon <task-id> --permit --override-live
```

## Steer a blocked worker (`agent-dispatch card` / `steer`)

*Hibernate-the-wait* handles a wait on a **machine** condition; **steering**
handles a wait on a **human** decision. When a goal-loop worker needs operator
input it can't make itself (screen a draft before it posts, choose between
options, confirm a risky step), it **posts a card** describing what it needs and
suspends; the operator answers later through any surface, and the coordinator
**wakes the worker** with the answer.

```bash
# The worker posts a card describing what it needs and suspends. A --request-input
# form marks the task "awaiting-steer" (blocked on the operator):
agent-dispatch card set <id> \
  --title "Confirm rollout plan" --status "Ready for operator direction" \
  --link "<url to the rich artifact>" --body @card.md \
  --request-input "decision:choice[Proceed,Revise],notes:textarea?decision=Revise"

# Anyone can see what's blocked on them and read a card + its steer inbox:
agent-dispatch list --status started        # awaiting_steer=true rows are "needs you"
agent-dispatch card show <id>

# The operator answers; --wake nudges the owning worktree to resume (default on):
agent-dispatch steer submit <id> --field decision=Proceed

# The resumed worker drains all answers and continues toward its goal:
agent-dispatch steer take <id> --all        # -> {"steers": [{"fields": {...}, "sender": ...}]}
```

- **`card`** is a latest-only object on the task (`title`/`status`/`link`/`body`/
  `request_input`); the rich artifact lives elsewhere (a doc/PR the `link` points
  at) -- the card is only the glanceable brief + the form. `--request-input` is a
  compact field spec (`name[:text|textarea|choice[a,b,...]]`, comma-separated).
  Append `?choice_field=value` to gate a follow-up field on a single-select
  answer (for example, `reason:textarea?feedback=Reject`). Choice fields select
  their first option by default, so a producer can put its recommendation first
  while still offering the alternatives. Conditions are one level deep: their
  source must be an unconditional choice, and the expected value must be one of
  that choice's declared options.
- **`steer submit`** appends the operator's answer to the task's append-only steer
  inbox and clears `awaiting_steer`; it is **not** worker-owned (the operator, or a
  surface acting for them, answers). After persistence, the coordinator asks
  agent-bridge to resume the owner immediately (and queues the prompt if that
  owner is busy), regardless of which surface submitted the answer. Bridge
  failure never loses the durable steer. `steer take --all` is the owner-gated
  wake-side read that atomically drains every pending answer for the resumed
  worker; plain `steer take` remains the one-at-a-time inspection form.
- **General, not domain-specific.** The coordinator stores card/steer objects
  opaquely, so any dispatched agent that must block on operator input uses this --
  the same transport a picker "form" surface or an `ask_user` skill writes through.
- **Never a verdict.** Steering carries operator *guidance*; there is no task
  state/verb/`result_ref` that sets an outcome from it. A card is posted on a
  **held** task and leaves it held (never a terminal transition).

## Development

```bash
cd plugins/agent-dispatch
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

## Coordinator + CLI

Run the per-host coordinator (loopback by default), then drive it with the CLI:

```bash
agent-dispatch serve                     # binds loopback on an OS-assigned port
                                         # (AGENT_DISPATCH_PORT pins if needed)

# from any agent/producer (AGENT_DISPATCH_URL points at the coordinator):
agent-dispatch create "Add narration track" --require logger --dedup-key seg42
agent-dispatch worktree-status           # this worktree's inbox: tasks assigned to + owned by it
agent-dispatch inbox                      # machine-scoped, cross-lane pickable tasks (default: proposed)
agent-dispatch inbox --board              # lifecycle groups + independent ACTIVE/STALLED execution badge
agent-dispatch claim                     # lease my assigned/eligible task (identity auto-resolved)
agent-dispatch claim  <task-id>          # claim THAT specific task (positional = task id, like the verbs below)
agent-dispatch claim  <task-id> --worker <owner>   # ...as an explicit owner (rarely needed; default: CWD identity)
agent-dispatch claim  <task-id> --all-repos        # explicit administrative cross-lane claim
agent-dispatch start  <id>  <owner>
agent-dispatch suspend <id> <owner> --reason "waiting for an external result"
agent-dispatch resume <id> <owner>                 # same owner; durable async wake
agent-dispatch release <id> <owner> --reason "use a replacement"
agent-dispatch complete <id> <owner> --result-ref artifact/123
agent-dispatch complete <id> <owner> --result-file result.json
agent-dispatch result <id> [--raw]
agent-dispatch list --status queued
agent-dispatch recover                                 # requeue tasks whose owner is gone
agent-dispatch watch                                   # stream task events (SSE) as JSON lines
```

Completion accepts an optional JSON object/array result through
`--result-json` or the cross-platform-friendly `--result-file` (`-` reads
stdin; one leading UTF-8 BOM is accepted on every input path). The client
prechecks the canonical JSON size rather than the source file's formatting, the
coordinator validates strict structured JSON, caps its canonical UTF-8 encoding
at 64 KiB, and commits the result, `result_ref`, terminal status, and stable
completing identity in one SQLite transaction. Invalid input returns HTTP 400,
oversized input returns HTTP 413, and both leave the task non-terminal. JSON
null and scalars are rejected. MCP clients should send a decoded object or array;
the MCP SDK may normalize a JSON-encoded object string before tool invocation.

`show` keeps the decoded `result`. Bulk `list`/`find`/`sweep`/`inbox` rows omit
the potentially large value and expose `has_result`; retrieve it with
`result <id>`, `GET /tasks/<id>/result`, or MCP `dispatch_result`. SSE events
also expose only `has_result`, never the result body. Initial completion emits
`task.submitted`; a later retry that fills a previously missing result emits
`task.result_recorded`. Repeating the identical recorded result is a no-op and
emits neither event again.

When a structured result is sent, a new client verifies the coordinator returned
the recorded value. A coordinator too old to store it raises an explicit
upgrade-required error instead of reporting silent success. After upgrading, the
same completing owner may retry only to fill a missing result (or repeat the
identical value); a different or conflicting result is never overwritten.
Omitting the result preserves the existing completion behavior.

For MCP `dispatch_complete`, omit the `result` argument when there is no
structured result. Explicit JSON null is rejected consistently with the CLI and
REST surfaces.

Results use a bounded database field rather than the payload blob store because
the filesystem cannot participate in the SQLite completion transaction. The
result remains opaque: agent-dispatch stores and returns JSON values without
interpreting domain-specific fields.

`inbox` complements the two lane-scoped reads: `worktree-status` is *this
worktree's* assigned/owned tasks, and `list` is scoped to the calling repo's
lane, but `inbox` spans **every** lane and returns the tasks *this machine* can
pick up — a matching `target_machine` plus machine-agnostic ones — defaulting to
the `proposed` state. Each entry carries `target_worktree`, `affinity`, `labels`
and `repo_name`, so a consumer (e.g. the worktree picker's task pivot) can group
by worktree and badge handoffs. The machine is resolved from the CWD via
`agent-worktrees`; pass `--machine <name>` to override.

### Worker identity

An agent's identity is the **`machine`/`worktree_id`** pair — the only durable
agent id a multi-machine system has. `claim` and `worktree-status` **resolve it from the
current directory** by delegating to `agent-worktrees` (the same CWD resolution
git uses), so an agent in its worktree just runs `agent-dispatch worktree-status`
/ `agent-dispatch claim` with no arguments. Claiming stamps that pair as the
task's `owner`, and **claim honors targeting**: an agent only leases tasks that
are untargeted or targeted at its own machine/worktree. Pass `--machine` /
`--worktree` to override the resolution (or where `agent-worktrees` is absent).
The resolved repo lane is mandatory at every normal CLI, REST, and MCP claim
surface. A caller outside a repo must pass `--repo`; only an intentional
cross-lane supervisor or administrator passes explicit `--all-repos`.

The coordinator publishes `task.created` / `.proposed` / `.approved` / `.claimed`
/ `.started` / `.suspended` / `.resumed` / `.released` / `.yielded` /
`.completed` / `.abandoned` / `.detached` events on
`GET /events` (Server-Sent Events) — the hook a subscriber (e.g. agent-bridge)
reacts to.

### Spawning a worker (agent-bridge)

`create --spawn` asks **agent-bridge** to spawn a worker agent that claims and
executes the task:

```bash
agent-dispatch create "Summarize PR 42" --require review --spawn            # managed (waits)
agent-dispatch create "Summarize PR 42" --spawn --spawn-agent task-worker --async  # fire-and-forget
```

The worker is instructed to claim the specific task by id
(`agent-dispatch claim <task> --worker <id>`). If the `agent-bridge` CLI isn't on
PATH, `--spawn` **degrades gracefully** — the task is simply left queued for any
worker to claim, so agent-dispatch stays usable without a bridge.

`--spawn` is guarded against **double-spawn** by an atomic **spawn reservation**
taken from the coordinator before anything is launched: a dedup collision
(`--spawn` on an existing `dedup_key`) or a racing second `--spawn` spawns the
worker **exactly once**; the rest skip. See
[`docs/spawn-supervisor.md`](docs/spawn-supervisor.md) for the reservation model.

An optional **routing assignment** may be attached to a reservation before
launch. Agent-dispatch is the single writer for this append-only provenance:
purpose, literal selected model, demonstrated/candidate state, selection reason,
execution surface, trial/decision references, session linkage, lifecycle
events, terminal disposition, and optional unique opaque provider-event
references. The record contains no prompt, source body, credential, or monetary
value; external accounting systems may join provider events without
double-counting them.

Routing provenance is not candidate admission by itself. Existing spawn callers
remain unchanged, and no routing record is required for legacy tasks.

### Supervising a lane (`agent-dispatch supervise`)

The supervisor turns **queued** tasks into host embody autopilots — **exactly
once each** — over the same reservation primitive. It's generic (no
producer-specific logic) and safety-first: a task is spawned only when a *fresh*
reservation is acquired, so a slow-but-alive embody with an active reservation is
never double-spawned.

```bash
agent-dispatch supervise --once                       # one cycle (this repo's lane)
agent-dispatch supervise --label autopilot            # loop; only spawn opted-in tasks
agent-dispatch supervise --all-repos --max-active-processes 3
agent-dispatch supervise --label sweep --headless-label sweep   # embody 'sweep' headless-ACP
agent-dispatch supervise --label maintenance --script-label maintenance
agent-dispatch supervise --pool host-a,host-b --origin origin --headless --label sweep
agent-dispatch supervise --interval 30                          # fixed reconciliation
agent-dispatch supervise --evaluator eval.json --evaluator-ref repository-review-lifecycle
agent-dispatch reservations list --state spawned      # what's in flight
agent-dispatch reservations fail <key>                # release a confirmed-dead spawn
```

`--max-active-processes` (legacy alias `--max-concurrent`) is a **pool-local**
cap on live or launching worker processes, not on durable tasks. Queued tasks
are unlimited. Suspended tasks and tasks blocked on a card are cold: their
headless bridge process is stopped while the task, owner, progress, card, and
spawn handle remain durable. Submitting a steer releases the cold reservation
and queues a fresh embodiment that consumes the saved guidance. Because the cap
is evaluated only over tasks matching this supervisor's repo/label filter,
unrelated pools do not consume one another's process capacity.

Each cycle **reconciles** (settles reservations of terminal tasks), optionally runs
the **evaluator pass**, then **polls** (reserve → embody → record, up to
`--max-concurrent`). It also **heartbeats the lease of every confirmed-alive
worker** so a quiet-but-alive session is not wrongly recovered (disable with
`--no-heartbeat`), **releases and re-queues confirmed-gone bodies** for
re-embodiment, and can **nudge stalled-but-live workers** before recovery. An
`unknown` liveness probe is always left alone. Repeated spawn failures are
treated as a supervisor dead-letter condition (failed reservation history; no
more auto-retry until a human intervenes), not as a second task state change.
The serve loop uses fixed-interval reconciliation. The former two-second
turn-state sampler was retired because remote owners turned each sample into a
new SSH command. Prompt turn-end wakeups will return only through a cursor-based
Agent Bridge event subscription over a shared persistent carrier; until then,
`--no-reactive` and `--reactive-interval` are accepted as compatibility no-ops.

The bare `supervise` above runs the loop in the foreground. The
`supervise register|status|list|remove` subcommands instead manage durable
**registrations** — a caller registers a unit (a lane, schedule, emitter, or
evaluator) with the host's singleton supervisor and gets back a handle, and the
call *returns* rather than becoming the loop. `supervise serve` runs the
**singleton daemon** that actually runs those registrations:

```bash
agent-dispatch supervise register --label autopilot   # register this lane; prints the handle
agent-dispatch supervise register --label autopilot --ensure   # + start the daemon if needed
agent-dispatch supervise list                         # what's registered here
agent-dispatch supervise status <id>                  # inspect one registration
agent-dispatch supervise remove <id>                  # drop one (the daemon winds it down)
agent-dispatch supervise serve                        # run the singleton daemon (foreground)
agent-dispatch supervise daemon-status                # is a daemon running here?
```

Exactly **one** daemon per machine-and-environment runs every registration, each
in its own subprocess, reconciling on change (start / restart-on-spec-change /
wind-down-on-remove / crash-revive) and single-instance-guarded by a crash-safe OS
lock (a second daemon stands down; a crashed one's lock is auto-released so a
restart reclaims it). The daemon directly runs the standing **supervised-lane**,
**schedule**, and **emitter** kinds; **registered evaluator rows are
coordinator-owned** and run only on the concrete verification triggers described
below, while the bare `supervise --evaluator` surface remains a one-off local
manual pass. Re-registering the same unit is idempotent (the derived handle
identifies it). See
[`docs/spawn-supervisor.md`](docs/spawn-supervisor.md#the-singleton-daemon-built--one-master-per-unit-subprocesses)
for the registration + daemon model.

An attributed active plugin may also contribute a strict
`kind: plugin-companion` declaration. Its command, stop command, health probe,
and optional configuration provider are plugin-relative argv; plugin root,
version, declaration path, and activation scopes remain attached to the desired
registration. This kind cannot be registered through the CLI/coordinator API or
trusted registrar pointers. The singleton daemon resolves the provider on every
reconcile, retains the last confirmed result only while declaration authority is
unchanged, and launches an active companion inside an OS-owned process tree.
Commands cannot escape the attributed plugin root or traverse symlink/reparse
components, and inherited `AGENT_DISPATCH_*` authority is stripped. A process
receipt fences recovery by PID plus process-start identity; confirmed unhealthy
probes restart the unit, while an unavailable or invalid probe is
indeterminate and leaves a live unit alone. On Windows, kill-on-close Jobs
retire companion trees with the daemon. On POSIX, process groups and receipts
allow a restarted daemon to recover a matching live companion without
duplicating it.

A companion may also declare versioned Python runtime inputs. The singleton
daemon prepares those inputs asynchronously under a supervisor-owned root:
plugin projects are copied into immutable snapshots, installed from disposable
working copies with a supervisor-selected toolchain, import-validated, and
atomically published as content-addressed cells. Root-wide process locks,
complete receipts, full-cell integrity checks, Windows base-Python signature
verification, and POSIX base-runtime identity prevent partial or ambiguous
reuse. Preparation does not inject the interpreter into launch state or restart
a healthy companion; selection and cutover are separate lifecycle increments.


**Evaluator pass — local/manual evaluation (`--evaluator <spec>`).** The bare
`supervise --evaluator <spec>` surface still exists for a one-off local
supervisor pass over lifecycle events, but **registered evaluator rows are
coordinator-owned**, not daemon-launched: the coordinator invokes them only on the
settled verification triggers (`task.submitted`, explicit `verify-submitted`
backfill, or an event-note re-trigger on an already-submitted task). That keeps
verification out of a polling loop and scoped to concrete external events.

Tasks embody as **headless ACP** by default, but the lane can mix bodies by
label: keep **self-contained sweep** labels headless, opt interactive labels to
the mux-wrapped **CLI autopilot** with `--cli-label L`, or opt deterministic
maintenance labels to a **plain script subprocess** with `--script-label L`.
Local headless bodies run in the exact reservation worktree pre-created and
attributed before launch, so failed, yielded, and terminal attempts can be
conservatively reclaimed without guessing ownership. Script bodies use no LLM at
all: they are ordinary subprocesses that drive claim/start/progress/complete/
abandon through the same lifecycle protocol. See the design doc's
"Per-label embody body" section.

Script-embodied tasks carry a JSON `payload_inline` that describes what to
launch:

- `{"path":"C:\\absolute\\worker.py","args":["..."],"env":{"K":"V"}}`
  runs the file with agent-dispatch's own runtime Python.
- `{"argv":["some-exe","arg1","arg2"],"cwd":"C:\\absolute\\dir","env":{"K":"V"}}`
  runs the exact argv directly.

`agent_dispatch.script_worker.ScriptTaskRuntime` is the small helper contract
for those bodies: it reads the supervisor-injected task/coordinator context from
environment variables and wraps claim/start/heartbeat/progress/complete/
abandon. Returning without an explicit terminal call is treated as a protocol
violation: an orderly exit auto-abandons in the helper, and a confirmed-gone
process is abandoned by supervisor recovery.

For a remote host pool, `--pool host-a,host-b [--origin <alias>]` dispatches the
body to the first live pool host. The default body is still CLI/mux embody on
that host; add `--headless` to make **every** fleet body a headless agent-bridge
ACP session there (`ssh <host> agent-bridge create <agent> "<fleet seed>"
--no-wait`). Fleet headless mode uses the same Model-C seed and synthetic owner
as CLI fleet mode, records no worktree handle, and ignores `--headless-label`.
See the design doc's "Headless-fleet body" section.

## MCP tools (`agent-dispatch mcp`)

For agents that prefer **tools over a CLI**, `agent-dispatch mcp` runs a local
**stdio MCP server** — the per-agent interaction layer. It resolves the caller's
`machine`/`worktree` identity and repo lane from the working directory (like the CLI) and
proxies each tool call to the coordinator, so `dispatch_claim` /
`dispatch_worktree_status` are auto-scoped to the agent's worktree with no
per-agent credential wiring. Requires the `mcp` extra
(`pip install 'agent-dispatch[mcp]'`).

Point a Copilot sub-agent (or any MCP client) at it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-dispatch": {
      "command": "agent-dispatch",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

It exposes the queue plus producer operations as tools: `dispatch_create` / `dispatch_approve` /
`dispatch_producer_scope_status` / `dispatch_producer_scope_handoff` /
`dispatch_find` / `dispatch_sweep` / `dispatch_recipe_list` /
`dispatch_recipe_render` / `dispatch_recipe_kick` /
`dispatch_emitter_side_load` / `dispatch_list` /
`dispatch_show` / `dispatch_events` / `dispatch_wakes` / `dispatch_payload` /
`dispatch_result` / `dispatch_worktree_status` / `dispatch_claim` / `dispatch_start` /
`dispatch_yield` / `dispatch_suspend` / `dispatch_resume` /
`dispatch_release` / `dispatch_complete` / `dispatch_abandon` /
`dispatch_heartbeat` / `dispatch_detach` / `dispatch_recover`. Wake-bearing
operations return after scheduling delivery; inspect the task audit trail for
the eventual result, or use `agent-dispatch wakes <id>`.
`dispatch_create` takes an inline `payload` the coordinator spills to a blob when
large. `dispatch_complete` accepts the same optional decoded object/array `result` as
the CLI/REST completion path.

### Two MCP surfaces

There are **two** ways to reach the tools — pick by where the client runs:

| Surface | Command / endpoint | Identity | Use when |
|---------|--------------------|----------|----------|
| **Local stdio shim** | `agent-dispatch mcp` | resolved from the caller's **CWD** (like the CLI) | the agent has `agent-dispatch` installed locally in its worktree |
| **Coordinator-hosted HTTP** | mounted at **`/mcp`** on the discovered coordinator endpoint | `X-Agent-Machine` / `X-Agent-Worktree` / `X-Agent-Repo` **request headers** (or explicit tool args) | a remote MCP client (e.g. an `agent-mcp` bridge on another host) that can't resolve local identity |

Both expose the same `dispatch_*` tools and publish the same task and producer
fence events;
they only differ in how identity is supplied. The coordinator mounts `/mcp`
automatically when the `mcp` extra is installed (pass `enable_mcp=False` to
`create_app` to suppress it); if a bearer token is configured it also guards the
`/mcp` mount. A remote client points at, e.g.,
`http://<discovered-coordinator-endpoint>/mcp` and sets the identity headers per
agent.

Configuration (all optional): `AGENT_DISPATCH_HOST`, `AGENT_DISPATCH_PORT`
(server bind pin; omitted means OS-assigned port), `AGENT_DISPATCH_DB`,
`AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` (ordinary bearer auth),
`AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN_COMMAND`
(superset queue credential with managed-producer transition authority;
required-but-unset also gates evaluator registrations, not just scope
transitions -- see Evaluator below),
`AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY_COMMAND` (preferred on-demand capability
fetch) / `AGENT_DISPATCH_PRODUCER_CAPABILITY` (raw fallback; applied only with
the rest of the fence tuple),
`AGENT_DISPATCH_GC_INTERVAL` (liveness garbage-collection cadence
in seconds; `0` disables), `AGENT_DISPATCH_RUN_DIR` /
`AGENT_DISPATCH_ENDPOINT` (local endpoint discovery), `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL`
(client override), `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_URL` /
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_TOKEN` / `AGENT_DISPATCH_SHARED_CONTROL_TOKEN` (opt-in
shared coordinator), `AGENT_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOSTART` (disable lazy local
coordinator start), and `AGENT_DISPATCH_ENFORCE_REGISTERED_REPOS` (opt-in,
default off: refuse task creation against a repo lane with no registered
`repo`-kind registrar pointer alias -- a repo with no pointer has no
coordinator/supervisor of its own watching it, so a task queued against it
can sit unclaimed indefinitely. Register one with `agent-dispatch registrar
add-pointer <name> <repo-root> --kind repo [--alias <canonical-lane> ...]`
before enabling this on a coordinator that serves more than one lane.
**Migration note:** a pointer registered *before* this flag existed has no
alias at all (`aliases` defaults to empty for a legacy record), and
re-registering it with no `--alias` **preserves that empty set** rather than
auto-deriving one -- enabling enforcement without first adding an explicit
`--alias` to every pre-existing pointer will reject their lanes' tasks).

### Federation (`agent-dispatch federation run|status`)

Opt-in cross-machine awareness/claim-plane participation (see the
`agent-dispatch-federation` effort): `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_ROLE`
(`peer` / `coordinator` / `standby` / `satellite`; unset = federation
disabled), `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_INSTANCE` (directory id override;
defaults to the resolved machine id), `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_INTERVAL`
(seconds between ticks; default 15), `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_BACKEND`
(`gateway` default / `devtunnels`), `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_DEVTUNNEL_BIN`
/ `AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_DEVTUNNEL_LABEL` (Dev Tunnels backend only).

**`role=satellite`** additionally pushes this machine's own live worktree/
embodiment status (never anything reached over SSH), gated by
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SATELLITE_GATE` -- accepted open values: `open`, `1`, `true`,
`yes`, `on` (case-insensitive); anything else, including unset, is **closed**.
The gate defaults **closed**: a configured `role=satellite` node never
registers, heartbeats, or pushes status until an operator explicitly opens
it, and it withdraws on the very next tick if the gate closes mid-session.

While the gate is open, a satellite also **pulls its own affinitied work**
(the `satellite-agent-exposure` effort's Phase 3 claim-loop --
:mod:`agent_dispatch.satellite_work_intake`): it discovers its own `queued`
tasks on the shared coordinator and locally embodies a bounded number of
them via `agent-worktrees embody` (the spawned session performs the actual
atomic claim itself, under its own worktree identity -- no new claim
transport). Tunable via `AGENT_DISPATCH_SATELLITE_MAX_CONCURRENT`
(concurrency cap, default `1`), `AGENT_DISPATCH_SATELLITE_PROJECT` (an
explicit `--project` override; unset derives one per task from its own repo
lane instead -- set this only when every task this satellite pulls belongs
to the same project), `AGENT_DISPATCH_SATELLITE_SPAWN_TIMEOUT` (seconds
bounding one spawn attempt so a hung `embody` launch can never block this
node's own heartbeats indefinitely; default `30`), and
`AGENT_DISPATCH_SATELLITE_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT` (seconds bounding the whole
queued-task discovery pagination for one tick, independent of any single
request's own HTTP timeout; default `10`).

`agent-dispatch federation status` prints the discovered coordinator + live
peers, plus a `self` section (`role` / `instance` / `gate_state`) reporting
THIS node's own state. A gate-closed satellite never registers at all, so it
would otherwise be invisible even to its own operator running this command
locally; `self.gate_state` (`open`/`closed`, satellite roles only) makes that
distinguishable from "not yet started." Pass `--role`/`--instance` to report
a role/instance other than the environment default
(`AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_ROLE`/`AGENT_DISPATCH_FEDERATION_INSTANCE`).

Bearer scheme matching is case-insensitive. Prefer environment or token-command
configuration over token flags where process arguments may be observable.

## Troubleshooting

- `agent-dispatch health` checks the selected coordinator without lazy-starting
  one. Other local client verbs lazy-start a detached coordinator unless
  `AGENT_DISPATCH_NO_AUTOSTART` is set, a remote `--url`/`--shared` is used, or
  the caller is in WSL (the Windows host owns the coordinator).
- `scripts/install.{sh,ps1} status` reports the deployed version/manifest, the
  coordinator service, and every supervisor profile. Runtime logs live under
  `~/.agent-dispatch/` (`serve-service.log`, `reconcile.err.log`,
  `running-version.json`, `current-version`).
- Version drift is intentionally fail-loud: the session-start hook compares the
  installed payload version with `deploy-manifest.json` / `current-version` and
  reconciles in the background; a running coordinator writes
  `running-version.json` so the launcher can distinguish the live imported
  version from the on-disk slot.
- Wildcard binds (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) require `AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN`; otherwise the
  server refuses to start rather than expose the task-control API on the LAN.
