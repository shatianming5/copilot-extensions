#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh -- canonical, vendored byte-identically into
# every plugin that ships a sessionStart bootstrap-check hook (see
# tools/sync-bootstrap-killswitch.py). Lets an operator/agent pause EVERY
# plugin's automatic reconcile-on-session-start at once, with one switch, so
# a hand-diagnosis of a venv/install (walking it manually, comparing paths,
# re-running an installer step by step) never races a background reconcile
# silently redoing/undoing the same work underneath it.
#
# State lives in ONE shared, cross-plugin file -- not per-plugin -- so a
# single on/off affects every plugin's hook uniformly:
#   ~/.copilot-extensions/bootstrap-killswitch.json
#   {"active": true, "reason": "...", "set_by": "...", "set_at": "..."}
#
# Primary usage -- as a subprocess, from the FIRST lines of any
# bootstrap-check.sh, before any version/reconcile logic runs:
#   if bash "$ScriptDir/bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh" check >&2; then
#     printf '{}'; exit 0
#   fi
# Exit 0  -> killswitch is ACTIVE; caller must skip its own reconcile.
# Exit 1  -> killswitch is INACTIVE, or the state file is missing/unreadable/
#            malformed. Fails OPEN to "inactive" deliberately: a corrupt or
#            stale state file must never permanently wedge every plugin's
#            reconcile -- the failure mode is "reconcile still runs", not
#            "every plugin is silently stuck forever".
#
# Secondary usage -- direct operator/agent control (also reachable via
# `agent-machines bootstrap-killswitch {on,off,status}`, which writes/reads
# this exact same state file):
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh on "<reason>"
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh off
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh status
#
# `on`/`off` run under `set -e`: a failed mkdir/write/rm now aborts BEFORE
# the success message prints, so an operator is never told the switch
# changed when it didn't. The state write itself is atomic (write to a
# same-directory temp file, then rename) so a concurrent `check` never
# observes a torn/partial write mid-update -- it was a real race before:
# writing the file in place left a window where every hook's `check` would
# see empty/truncated JSON, fail OPEN, and let a reconcile through even
# though the switch was (or was about to be) active.
