"""Import guard for the split-out spawn-reservation ``TaskQueue`` mixin.

Every method here is already thoroughly exercised through
``agent_dispatch.queue.TaskQueue`` (``test_spawn_reservation.py``,
``test_spawn_consistency_sweep.py``, and the routing/supervisor
integration coverage in ``test_routing_provenance.py`` /
``test_supervisor.py``) -- this file only guards that
``agent_dispatch.queue_spawn_reservations`` remains directly importable
with its own stable public surface, is actually composed into
``TaskQueue``, and that its record-type annotations resolve cleanly to
``typing.get_type_hints()`` (built with the ``queue_schedule_registry.py``
lesson already applied -- ordinary top-level imports from
``queue_records``, not a ``TYPE_CHECKING``-guarded lazy import -- so this
guard should stay green without ever needing a follow-up fix).
