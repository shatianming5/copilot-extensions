"""Tests for ``board_relay.py`` -- Phase 3a's agent-dispatch CLI relay.

These exercise the single-threaded control loop directly (feeding a plain
``queue.Queue`` as a stand-in for ``_Reader``, and a fake snapshot object),
rather than spinning up a real SSE connection -- `test_coordinator.py`'s own
`test_stream_events_ready_frame_handshake` already covers the real
client/server handshake end-to-end. A fake ``board_cli._emit_frame`` that
returns ``False`` after a bounded number of calls doubles as this test
module's deterministic "stop the loop" mechanism (mirroring the real
contract: the loop ends the moment the reader closes the pipe), so no test
here needs to fake the wall clock.
