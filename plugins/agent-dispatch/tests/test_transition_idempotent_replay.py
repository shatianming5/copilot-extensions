"""Phase 10 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort) item 2 tests:
prove the narrow idempotent-replay no-op ``TaskQueue._transition`` now
implements for ``approve``, ``start``, ``resume`` (plain, non-adoption
path), ``release_suspended``, ``abandon``, and ``yield_task``.

Per the approved design: a request that finds the task **already sitting
in the exact target state** under matching identity fences (owner, and
generation/owner-session when the caller supplied ``expected_generation``)
is a no-op that returns the current task rather than raising -- but any
other mismatch (wrong owner, wrong state entirely, a fenced generation
that no longer matches) still raises exactly as before. This closes the
gap `machine_coupling.py` declared (idempotent replay is a no-op, not an
error) for the methods that previously always raised on replay; `suspend`
and `complete_with_outcome` already had their own hand-written versions of
this pattern before this change.
