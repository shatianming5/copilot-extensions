"""Phase 10 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort, live-wiring pass)
regression tests: prove ``TaskQueue``'s public lifecycle methods actually
*source* their legal-transition data from
``agent_dispatch.task_state_machine.TRANSITIONS_BY_NAME`` rather than a
separately hardcoded, coincidentally-matching set of literals.

Each test monkeypatches one declared transition's ``from_states``/
``to_state`` and asserts the corresponding live method's behavior changes
to match -- this is what proves genuine wiring rather than parity that
happens to hold today and could silently drift tomorrow. Complements
``test_task_state_machine.py`` (which only proves the declared table is
internally sound) and ``test_queue.py`` (which proves the live behavior is
correct against today's real hardcoded literals).
