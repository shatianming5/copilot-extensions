"""Regression guard for ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2863 and #3419.

A deployed agent-dispatch package was missing a function its own import site
required, even though every verified copy of that release's actual source
(git history and the exact snapshot used for the install alike) defined it
correctly. The mismatch traced to two compounding gaps in
`install.sh`/`install.ps1`:

1. `uv pip install` on a local PATH source caches its build by source path,
   not source content, so a stale wheel built under a reused path/version
   can silently be served instead of a fresh build.
2. The post-install health gate only ran a bare `import agent_dispatch`,
   which never touches `agent_dispatch.embody` -- that module is imported
   lazily, only inside `spawn_factories.make_headless_spawn`, so a broken
   import there was invisible to `agent-dispatch health`/`daemon-status`
   and only surfaced on the first real spawn attempt.

#3419 found the health gate still had a second, same-shape blind spot: it
never imported `agent_dispatch.__main__`, the CLI entry point that wires
`recipes_cli.register_recipes_commands`. A published `0.1.2-dev193` build
whose `recipes_cli.py` got silently truncated (missing that function
entirely, root-caused to a likely packaging-time race) sailed straight
through the gate -- `import agent_dispatch, agent_dispatch.embody` never
touches `__main__.py`'s own top-level imports -- and activated a completely
non-functional CLI that crash-looped the coordinator's systemd unit on
every launch.

These tests are static-text guards (following the precedent in
`test_install_sh_version_ordering.py`) ensuring all three fixes stay in
place: the local-path install always forces a fresh build for
agent-dispatch AND its own local `[tool.uv.sources]` workspace path deps
(equally vulnerable local PATH sources -- #2863 separately flagged a
same-class ImportError against one of them, `agent-procutil`, in the
self-update fallback path); the health gate exercises the lazily-imported
`embody` chain before a slot is activated or reported healthy; and the
health gate also exercises the CLI entry point's own `__main__` import
chain.
