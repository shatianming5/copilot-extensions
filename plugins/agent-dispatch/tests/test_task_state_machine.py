"""Structural tests for the declared task state-machine table.

These are Phase 9 (``review-automation-reliability`` effort) fixtures: they
assert properties of the *declared* transition table in
``agent_dispatch.task_state_machine``, not a live queue/coordinator. No
process, no filesystem, no network -- purely a check that the table itself
is internally consistent before any scenario fixture is built on top of it.
