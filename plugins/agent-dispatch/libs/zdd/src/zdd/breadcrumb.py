"""Durable cutover breadcrumb + stale-cutover recovery (#1756).

The cutover orchestrator runs in the short-lived ``agent-bridge deploy``
process, *separate* from the daemons it manipulates. If that process dies after
it has opened the old daemon's drain gate but before it retires the old daemon
(new daemon never adopts, orchestrator crashes, operator Ctrl-C's the deploy),
nothing in :meth:`CutoverOrchestrator.run` gets to roll back -- the old daemon
is left ``draining=true`` forever, refusing all new work, with **no record** of
why it is drained.

The breadcrumb closes that gap. It is a small JSON file written *before* the
drain gate is ever touched and updated at each phase, so an aborted cutover
leaves a durable, attributable trace on disk (which cutover, when, old/new
ports). :func:`recover_stale_cutover` reads it and undrains the stranded
survivor so the daemon does not stay closed to new sessions.

File layout (``<config_dir>/cutover.json``)::

    {
      "state": "draining",              # started|flipped|draining|
                                        # committed|rolled_back|failed
      "started_at": "2026-07-02T22:40:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-07-02T22:41:03Z",
      "pid": 12345,                     # the deploy orchestrator pid
      "old": {"bind": "127.0.0.1", "port": 9281},
      "new_port": 9282,
      "new_pid": 12401,                 # the spawn_passive daemon's own pid
      "error": null
    }

A breadcrumb in a **non-terminal** state (``started``/``flipped``/``draining``)
marks an in-progress *or aborted* cutover: if the orchestrator were still alive
it would have advanced the state, so finding one on disk after the deploy
process is gone means the cutover aborted mid-flight.

**The matching gap for the *new* daemon (the downstream tracker).** The breadcrumb
above was designed to heal the stranded *old* survivor. It does not, by itself,
help the *new* passive daemon ``spawn_passive`` just stood up: if the
orchestrator dies before that passive is ever promoted (flipped to ``active``),
the passive never becomes anyone's "old" and self-retire's active-ness gate
never arms for it -- it lingers indefinitely holding a port/pid. ``new_pid``
closes that gap: it is recorded the moment the passive is spawned (before the
flip is even attempted), so a breadcrumb that outlives its orchestrator names
both survivors -- the old one to undrain, and the new one to reap if it was
never promoted. See :func:`reap_abandoned_passive`.

    ``spawn_passive`` stands the new daemon up *before* the breadcrumb can

    crash, ``kill -9``, an operator Ctrl-C -- before the flip (or dies after
    the flip but before the commit point, in a way :func:`recover_stale_cutover`
    cannot reconcile because the *old* survivor is also gone), the freshly
    spawned passive never becomes ``active``. Self-retire's active-ness gate
    only ever arms for a coordinator that has observed its own pid as
    ``active``, so a never-promoted passive arms nothing and lingers
    indefinitely holding a port/pid. :func:`recover_stale_cutover` already
    undrains the stranded *old* survivor; this is the matching backstop for
    the stranded *new* passive.

    Deliberately conservative -- every ambiguous case is a no-op:

    - no breadcrumb, or a terminal one (:func:`is_stale` is ``False``),
    - the breadcrumb has no recorded ``new_pid`` (a pre-fix breadcrumb, or a
      cutover that aborted before ``spawn_passive`` ever ran),
    - the breadcrumb is younger than ``grace_seconds`` (a genuinely in-flight
      cutover -- most importantly its own drain step -- must never be
      disturbed),
    - ``new_pid`` matches ``active_pid`` (the caller's own confirmed-live
      routing-table ``active`` pid): it *was* promoted, so it is not
      abandoned and must never be touched,
    - ``pid_alive(new_pid)`` is falsy (already gone -- nothing to do).

    ``pid_alive`` and ``terminate`` are injected so this stays pure/stdlib:
    a real caller should compose a positive identity check into ``pid_alive``
    (e.g. re-verify the pid is still a coordinator process by cmdline, not
    just "some process with this number") to guard against pid reuse, mirroring
    the identity-check discipline in ``single_instance_lease``'s reaper.

    Callers must pass the **same breadcrumb record** they read before calling
    :func:`recover_stale_cutover` (via ``record=``) rather than letting this
    function re-read the file -- ``recover_stale_cutover`` rewrites the
    breadcrumb to a terminal state, which would make this function's own
    staleness check see nothing to do.
