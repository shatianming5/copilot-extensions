"""Owner-liveness tether for the daemon's own generation: self-retire when
superseded.

Thin adapter over the shared ``single_instance_lease`` supersession decision
(extracted from this module -- copilot-extensions #737). Detachment (a
zero-downtime redeploy stands the new daemon up beside the old and flips a
routing table so clients follow it) can leave a *demoted* daemon running with
nothing to shut it down; a daemon that observes it has been superseded by a live,
strictly-newer generation drains and exits on its own instead of lingering.

This module keeps agent-bridge's ``is_superseded(config_dir, ...)`` shape -- it
reads the routing table via ``zdd`` and delegates the pure, fail-safe decision to
the library, which returns ``True`` only when the ``active`` entry is a
*different* pid, at a *strictly higher* generation, that is *actually listening*.
Every ambiguous state returns ``False`` (stay alive). The genuinely-active daemon
always reads its own pid as ``active`` and therefore can never self-retire.

    abandoned-passive reap (#5195) runs once, in the separate short-lived
    ``deploy`` CLI process, *before* this daemon's own process even starts --
    there is no in-process loop here to report a live status for, so adding
    that key would fabricate a liveness signal that does not exist. A
    cross-process persisted "last reap outcome" is a distinct, larger design
