"""Rebuild a local ``-L`` forward from a **persisted** endpoint descriptor.

A remote (CodeSpace / machine-mesh) Session Host is reached over an ``ssh -N -L``
forward. The *live* forward is held by the Spawner while the frontend runs, but a
**restarted** frontend has only the durable :class:`~.host_index.HostIndex`. So
``HostRecord.endpoint`` must carry everything needed to rebuild the forward from
**ssh-manager alone** -- no live Spawner, and (critically) no ``agent-codespaces``
import in the agent-bridge daemon. This module is that codec.

The descriptor is a plain JSON dict (it round-trips through the host index), so it
holds only the serializable :class:`~ssh_manager.SSHConfig` fields plus the
remote/local ports and a ``kind`` tag.
