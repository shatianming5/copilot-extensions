"""Single-instance guard -- at most one agent-bridge daemon per config dir.

Thin adapter over the shared ``single_instance_lease`` primitive (extracted from
this module so bridge/vault/index/worktrees inherit one correct implementation --
copilot-extensions #737). The mechanism -- an OS-level, exclusive, non-blocking
byte-range lock the kernel frees automatically when the holder dies, so a stale
lock can never wedge startup -- now lives in the library; this module only pins
the agent-bridge naming so the on-disk lock and every reader are unchanged.

A second ``agent-bridge start`` against the same config dir + port must *refuse*
instead of spawning a duplicate daemon (the root cause behind the installer's
flaky restart -- see #129). Keying on the **config dir** (not the plugin/venv
folder) is deliberate: the primary daemon (``~/.agent-bridge``) and the elevated
sub-daemon (``~/.agent-bridge/elevated``) have distinct config dirs, so each is
allowed its own single instance while two *primaries* can never coexist. Keying
additionally on the **port** lets an active and a passive daemon coexist on one
config dir during a zero-downtime cutover.
