"""Explicit version for the agent-bridge **HTTP wire contract** (dotfiles #632).

Plugin payloads update independently, so a client and the daemon it calls are
routinely at **different versions**. This module gives the HTTP surface an
explicit, advertised protocol version — distinct from the package
``__version__`` (a build stamp, not a contract) and from the ACP /
session-host ``PROTOCOL_VERSION``\\s (different transports) — so a client can
**gate a version-introduced capability on the daemon's advertised support**
instead of blind-sending a request an older daemon would ignore or reject. This
is the forward-compat half of the *version-skew-tolerant-contracts* invariant
(``visions/plugin-services`` → *interoperate-across-version-skew*).

Rules for evolving the contract:

- **Bump ``HTTP_PROTOCOL_VERSION``** when the HTTP surface gains a capability a
  client may need to *detect* (a new endpoint, a new request field with server
  behavior, a new response field a client depends on). Additive, tolerant-reader
  changes (a new optional field an old client simply ignores) do **not** require
  a bump — but bumping lets a newer client *know* the capability is present.
- **Raise ``HTTP_PROTOCOL_MIN_SUPPORTED``** only on a genuinely **breaking**
  change, and only after a deprecation window — it declares the oldest client
  contract this daemon still serves. It should move rarely.

The daemon advertises both on ``/health``; ``BridgeClient`` reads them (see
``daemon_protocol`` / ``daemon_supports``).
