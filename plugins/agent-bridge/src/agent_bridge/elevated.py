"""Elevated sub-daemon launcher (Windows) for Capability 2.

The primary (non-elevated) agent-bridge cannot spawn an *elevated* Copilot
directly. Instead it launches a second agent-bridge instance -- the **elevated
sub-daemon** -- bound to a separate loopback port and running with a full admin
token, then relays elevated agents to it over ACP-over-WebSocket (see
``acp_connect.py`` and ``routes/acp_ws.py``). Because the whole sub-daemon is
elevated, any agent it spawns (e.g. an enlistment-based ``base_repo`` agent) runs
elevated -- no per-agent ``gsudo`` wrapping.

Isolation: the sub-daemon runs with ``AGENT_BRIDGE_CONFIG_DIR`` pointed at
``<primary config dir>/elevated`` so it has its own ``config.yaml`` (distinct
port + db), its own ``auth.yaml`` (token), and its own ``sessions.db``. Local
agents are still auto-discovered from the shared
``~/.agent-worktrees/projects.yaml``.

Elevation: a scheduled task with ``RunLevel=HIGHEST`` runs the daemon with the
admin token. Creating such a task requires elevation, so we register+run it via a
single ``Start-Process -Verb RunAs`` bootstrap (one UAC prompt). Subsequent
``schtasks /run`` calls within the session are prompt-free. This is the
Task-Scheduler mechanism chosen for the effort; the sub-daemon is session-scoped.

Security note (v1): the sub-daemon binds loopback only and is gated by its bearer
token, but that token lives in a user-readable file, so another process running
as the same user could in principle drive the elevated agent. Acceptable on a
single-user dev box; hardening (admin-only token / launch-nonce handshake) is
tracked separately.
