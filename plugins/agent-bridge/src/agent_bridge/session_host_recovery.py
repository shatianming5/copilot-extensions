        After an agent-bridge restart, ``_rehydrate`` has marked host-backed
        sessions STOPPED. This reads the durable host index and, for each host
        whose process is still alive, re-establishes the ACP connection over the
        reattached loopback endpoint and **adopts** the existing ACP session --
        no child respawn, no lost session. Dead hosts are pruned. Returns the
        count reattached. No-op when no host index exists.

        ``claim_hosts=False`` (PR #4543 review) skips the generation-claim
        step entirely -- used for a **passive** cutover instance's own
        startup scan. A record with no recorded owner is, correctly,
        "recoverable" by design (Phase 2's claim/release/recover contract),
        but on this repo's first rollout of Phase 3 -- and for any record a
        generation registered without ever claiming its own writes -- that
        would let a still-passive, not-yet-promoted daemon claim (and
        reattach to) a Session Host the truly active old generation is still
        live and driving, before the verified-retirement gate ever runs. A
        passive instance therefore still warms up its ACP connections (the
        pre-Phase-3, goal-3 behavior, unchanged) but does not touch claim
        state; the post-cutover retry (``/api/v1/session-hosts/reattach``,
        called only once the old generation is *confirmed* exited) is the
        sole place claiming happens for a promoted generation. A normal
        (non-passive) cold start still claims at startup as before -- there
        is no other live generation to race in that case.

        **Version-mux (Phase 4).** A host advertising a wire-envelope protocol
        this frontend no longer speaks (a rare breaking host-layer change) is
        *not* driven with incompatible client code. Per :func:`plan_host`:
        a compatible host is reattached; an incompatible host whose child is
        still alive is **left running** so it keeps its child until the child's
        own stop (goal 1 -- never reap mid-turn); an incompatible host whose
        child has already stopped is reaped so it stops pinning its old install.
