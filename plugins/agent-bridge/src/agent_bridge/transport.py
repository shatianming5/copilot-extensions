    The manager maintains a persistent master connection per host, and
    subsequent ACP sessions multiplex over it (on Unix). On Windows,
    falls back to direct SSH (no multiplexing).

    Auth hooks from the machine topology are applied automatically:
    - Port forwards (-R) are passed to the master connection
    - Environment variables are injected into the remote command
    - Local service liveness is checked before connecting

    SSH hardening (BatchMode, -T, ConnectTimeout, ServerAliveInterval)
    is handled by ssh-manager's base args.

    When ``connect_timeout`` is set, the SSH connect (stage SSH_TO_TARGET) is
    retried with backoff until the deadline -- patience for a booting
    codespace / wake-on-LAN / ProxyJump host. Without it, a single attempt is
    made (fast fail), preserving legacy behavior. ``tracker`` records
    per-stage checkpoints.
