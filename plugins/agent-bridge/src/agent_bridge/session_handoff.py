        The in-place, bridge-native analogue of the interactive context handoff:

        1. Build the successor's opening prompt: either use an externally
           supplied seed verbatim, or ask the retiring child to author a
           continuation brief (synthesize one from session state if it cannot)
           and wrap it as the warm-start prompt.
        2. Spawn a successor with the SAME target (same worktree, agent, caller).
        3. Record a durable two-way predecessor/successor link.
        4. Announce the changeover with a ``session_handoff`` event on BOTH the
           predecessor's and the successor's event streams, so every caller --
           a UI following the worktree, a bridge-as-agent host, a CLI reader --
           follows the baton in place rather than staring at a retired session.
        5. Seed the successor's opening turn with the brief so it resumes warm.
