"""Background-refreshed, supervised cache for ``AgentResolver``'s namespaced
agent scan (pivot-streaming-transport Phase 3b).

``AgentResolver.list_agents_async()`` re-invokes every registered namespace
resolver's ``list()`` on every call (`agent_registry_resolver.py`). Each
resolver has its own short internal result TTL (`CliNamespaceResolver`'s
``_list_cache``), but that only de-dupes a *single* caller's own repeat
calls within the TTL window -- N concurrent callers (N Pickers each running
their own ``--subscribe`` poll tick) arriving before any one of them has
populated that cache still each trigger their own concurrent scan. Moving
the scan into the daemon as a background-refreshed cache means ``GET
/api/v1/agents`` becomes an O(1) read for a healthy, fresh hit, shared by
every caller.

This module deliberately does **not** cache the non-namespaced
(``AgentResolver.list_agents()``) rows -- that listing is a cheap in-memory
dict walk, not a scan, so caching it would only add a staleness class with
no benefit.

See ``efforts/active/pivot-streaming-transport/phase-3-design.md``'s 3b
section for the full design rationale (last-known-good retention,
uninitialized vs. failed vs. fresh per-namespace state, single-flight plus
generation-guarded publication, the ``force_refresh``/``require_complete``
protocol-gated request parameters, and the dynamic namespace set tracking
``refresh_provider_resolvers()``'s own add/remove/replace).
