"""Boundary-aware Session Host liveness for ``SessionManager``.

Split out of ``session_manager.py`` (module-size guard) to keep the
local-vs-remote pid-alive checks, the Phase 2 (#6744) dead-session settle,
and the live-host record queries in one small, focused unit. A mixin, not
a standalone service -- it reads ``SessionManager``'s own ``_host_index``/
``_db`` state and calls its other methods (``_reap_host_record``).

        Re-verifies liveness AFTER acquiring the lock, not just before: a
