        * **Ownership reservation** -- a *new* registration for a worktree is
          refused when a fresh owned-ACP :meth:`reserve_worktree_ownership`
          reservation holds it (an active owned session already controls the
          worktree). This is the ``registration must respect the reservation``
          half of #2912. A reservation whose owning session is no longer active
          (or absent) does not block.
        * **Terminal ``taken-over``** -- a heartbeat re-register is refused when
          the existing row is ``taken-over`` (a killed predecessor cannot
          resurrect itself via a late heartbeat). Lease-lapsed ``expired`` rows
          still revive normally.

        ``venue`` is an opaque, caller-supplied JSON string describing where a
        remote-venue CLI-mode session actually lives and how to reattach to it
        (``{"kind","target","mux_session_name"}``) -- ``None`` for the ordinary
        local case. Never interpreted here; carried through for
        reattach/observation guidance to read later
        (agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions Phase 4).

        Returns the resulting registration status: ``'live'`` on a successful
        insert/refresh, or a rejection reason -- ``'reserved'`` (an owned ACP
        reservation holds the worktree), ``'taken-over'`` (this id was taken
        over) or ``'incarnation_mismatch'`` (the pid or process start it reports
        contradicts the row it would update, or -- through a renamed id's alias
        -- its machine does: a stale heartbeat can't overwrite the successor).
        The route maps a rejection to HTTP 409.

        The upsert, the CLI-mode reservation claim and a same-process rollover
        (alias insertion + predecessor deletion) commit in one transaction, so
        a concurrent deregistration can't strand a half-rolled-over successor.

             worktree un-ownable, #2880), and its undelivered inbox messages are
             dropped so they can't reach a wrong future incarnation (#2906);
           - **still alive** -> ``wedged`` -- a distinct state that keeps the
             session legible and reclaimable to consumers (Neuron Forge can
             offer a read + explicit reclaim instead of pretending it is gone
             and forcing a blind take-over, #3145) while still reading as *not
             fresh* for the ownership/steer guards (``live_session_is_fresh``

           - **undeterminable** (Windows / bad pid) -> lease fallback: demote a
             lapsed ``live`` row to ``expired`` exactly as before (#2880); leave
             an existing ``wedged`` row alone (can't confirm its death).

           A returning CLI's re-register upsert flips ``expired``/``wedged`` back
           to ``live``.

        2. **Purge.** ``expired`` and terminal ``taken-over`` rows whose
           ``updated_at`` is older than the purge grace window are DELETEd (with
           any leftover inbox messages), so the registry self-cleans instead of
           accumulating a graveyard that ``list`` and consumers surface (#3144).
           ``wedged`` rows are never purged -- their process is alive.

        Returns the number of registrations demoted *out of* ``live`` this sweep
