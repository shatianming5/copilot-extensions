"""Emit a ``running-version.json`` marker for the launch-path reconciler.

``copilot plugin update`` bumps the *installed plugin* (payload) but does **not**
restart the deployed daemon, so agent-bridge can silently keep serving an older
build than its plugin -- the exact incident that motivated dotfiles #533 (a
``plugin update`` advanced the payload while the running daemon kept serving the
old runtime until a manual ``agent-bridge service restart``). The reconciler
(agent-worktrees ``reconcile.py``) compares the payload version against the
runtime's on-disk ``deploy-manifest.json``, which can match the payload while the
*running* daemon still lags. Emitting the actually-imported version on boot gives
the reconciler a truthful running-version signal.

The file is distinct from ``deploy-manifest.json`` (installer-owned):
``{"version", "pid", "started_at"[, "generation_id"]}``. A reader treats a
**dead pid** (or a missing file) as *no running version* and falls back to the
on-disk manifest, so this is purely additive and safe.

``generation_id``: the daemon's own
:class:`~agent_bridge.session_manager.SessionManager` computes its true,
opaque generation id (``zdd.claims.generation_id``, a
``version-pid-started_at`` string with microsecond timestamp precision) once
per process; independently recomputing it from outside the process isn't
possible (the timestamp component is minted at an arbitrary instant during
startup), so it must be read back from wherever the process itself recorded
it. Deliberately NOT exposed via the ``/health`` HTTP endpoint: that endpoint
is a registered wire-protocol contract
(``plugins/agent-bridge/contract/registry.json``), and any field there needs
a captured fixture tied to the exact commit it was captured from, which this
local, non-contract, best-effort marker file has no such constraint on. It
already exists for exactly this class of "truthful running-state signal"
problem and is read locally, never over HTTP.

A ``--passive`` ZDD-cutover successor complicates this: it must NOT write its
own id straight into the shared canonical marker at boot, because it isn't
promoted yet -- if the cutover then aborts, the marker would be left
permanently pairing the surviving active daemon's own pid/version with an
abandoned generation's id. Such a process instead stages its id in a
separate, PID-keyed file (:func:`stage_pending_generation_id`); only
``_reconcile_service_marker`` (called with a CONFIRMED-promoted pid) ever
consumes a staged entry (:func:`consume_pending_generation_id`) into the
canonical marker. An aborted/never-promoted passive's staged entry is simply
never consumed and is pruned the next time anything stages a new one.
