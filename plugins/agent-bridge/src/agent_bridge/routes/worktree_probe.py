"""Single-target worktree existence/ownership resolution (#3015, #6744).

Fan-out probes used when the fleet-wide ``WorktreeDiscoveryCache`` doesn't
(yet) know about a worktree -- a targeted, live ``list --worktree-id`` query
across every eligible agent, returning on first match rather than waiting on
a slow/unreachable one. Two flavors:

- :func:`owning_agent` / :func:`probe_archived_owner` -- resolve *who owns*
  an already-gone worktree from an archived/tombstoned record (session and
  lineage routes, #3015).
- :func:`probe_live_worktree` -- resolve a *full entry* (owner + on-disk
  path) from an on-disk-live record only (deliberately excludes archived/
  reaped ones), used as the cache-blind/stale-cache resume fallback (#6744,
  review #3121).

Split out of ``worktrees.py`` (module-size cap; see CONTRIBUTING.md's
Componentization convention). These fan-out helpers call back into
``worktrees.py`` (``_run_for_agent``, ``_parse_worktree_list``, ``get_cache``)
via a **deferred, module-qualified** lookup (``from . import worktrees as
wt`` inside each function, then ``wt.<name>``) rather than a top-level
``from .worktrees import <name>``. This avoids a circular import (this
module is itself imported by ``worktrees.py``) and, just as importantly,
keeps a test's ``patch("agent_bridge.routes.worktrees._run_for_agent", ...)``
effective -- a top-level import would freeze the reference at import time
and silently bypass the patch, since the patched attribute lives on the
``worktrees`` module object, not this one.
