    - ``session_turn_count``: number of prompt turns on that session
    - ``session_live``: True if the session is currently running or idle

    session, #1883):

    - ``mux_attached``: whether a terminal is attached (None if unknown)
    - ``interactive_cli``: ``held`` (attached/unknown), ``at-rest``
