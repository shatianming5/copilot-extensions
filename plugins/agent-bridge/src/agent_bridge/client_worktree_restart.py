"""``BridgeClient.restart_worktree`` -- a thin wrapper over ``POST
/api/v1/worktrees/{id}/restart``.

Extracted out of ``client.py`` (at its grandfathered module-size ceiling)
into its own mixin, mirroring this plugin's own precedent for landing new
capability in a fresh same-package module rather than compacting prose to
fit a shrinking ceiling.

This is the missing half of the reclaim sequence (agent-bridge-cold-resume
Phase 3, #6744): stopping a worktree's interactive CLI via
``agent-worktrees restart`` directly (not through this route) never expires
its live-session registration, so the terminated CLI's stale row can keep
the atomic ownership guard (#2879) refusing a later ``resume``/``reclaim``
until its heartbeat naturally lapses. This route already does that
invalidation server-side (see ``routes/worktrees.py``'s own ``#2906``
comment) -- callers that need to stop-then-force-resume a worktree (e.g.
``agent_dispatch.bridge_reclaim``) must go through here, not straight to
``agent-worktrees``.
