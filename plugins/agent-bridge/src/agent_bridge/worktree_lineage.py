"""Write a worktree's *session lineage* into the agent-worktrees ground layer.

The read-side companion of :mod:`worktree_head`. agent-worktrees **owns** the
durable session-lifecycle state (a per-worktree head derived from per-session
lifecycle + succession slots); agent-bridge keeps **no rival copy** of that
state (the vision's ``derive-dont-duplicate``). Historically the bridge violated
this on the ACP path: a bridge/Neuron-Forge handoff wrote succession only into
the bridge's own DB and never told the ground layer, so ``session-role`` /
``head-session`` diverged for ACP sessions and an ACP successor never learned it
*was* a successor.

This module closes that gap by shelling the **agent-worktrees CLI** to contribute
the lifecycle *facts* the ground layer reduces into the derived head:

- :func:`register_session` -- an ACP session started in a local worktree (so the
  ground layer knows it exists and the derived head is correct). The vision's
  *explicit session binding* names exactly this case ("a spawned successor, a
  headless launch ... would otherwise never register and leave the worktree
  looking unowned").
- :func:`link_succession` -- at a bridge handoff, mark the predecessor
  ``handed-off`` and make the successor the derived head in one atomic write.
- :func:`note_handoff` -- mirror the handoff into the worktree record's history.

Reads used to seed a successor's lineage awareness (the ``sessionStart`` role/
digest hook does **not** fire under ``copilot --acp``, so the successor gets this
via its opening turn instead):

- :func:`session_role` -- the successor's role over the ground layer.
- :func:`history_digest` -- the worktree's recent session-tagged history.

Every write and read is **fail-open**: a missing binstub, an untracked worktree,
a timeout, or a non-zero exit degrades to a no-op (writes) or ``None`` (reads) so
the ground layer is a *supplement*, never a mainline dependency -- a bridge
handoff must never break because the CLI could not be consulted.
