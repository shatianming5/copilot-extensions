"""Stage a repo's OWN enabled plugins as per-launch ``--plugin-dir`` args.

For a headless bridge launch of a repo's agent, read the same repository settings
that declare its desired stack -- ``.github/copilot/settings.json``
(Copilot-native) or, as a fallback, ``.claude/settings.json`` (Claude
convention) -- resolve every enabled identity to a concrete payload directory,
and compose the complete launch explicitly through ``--plugin-dir``. Staging is
per-launch, scoped to that one process; this module **never** writes
``~/.copilot/settings.json`` (``enabledPlugins`` /
``extraKnownMarketplaces``), never registers a marketplace, and never enables a
plugin globally.

Why this exists (verified, dotfiles#905): Copilot ACP mode does not activate
repository ``enabledPlugins`` by itself. The bridge therefore treats those
settings as the desired-stack declaration and supplies every resolved payload
explicitly. Local marketplaces provide source directories; installed inventory
provides the fallback for remote marketplaces and other identities without a
resolvable local source.

Marketplace/plugin/settings resolution across the Copilot-native and Claude
conventions (native preferred) lives in the shared, vendored ``plugin_resolve``
lib; this module keeps only the bridge-specific complete-stack staging and
leak-safe policy.

Every function fails safe: any error yields an empty result, never an exception
into the dispatch path.
