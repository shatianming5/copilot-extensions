"""Represent a live *interactive* Copilot CLI session over the bridge's SSE.

Phase 5 of the live-session-messaging effort: the **read** counterpart to the
Phase 1 registration inbox. A registered live interactive session (see
``routes/live_sessions.py``) pushes its Copilot **extension SDK** event stream
to the bridge, which translates those events into the bridge's *existing* event
vocabulary and exposes them over the ordinary ``EventLog`` + SSE machinery -- so
Neuron Forge (and any bridge consumer) can **view a live CLI session** without
the bridge owning the process and without the destructive take-over that is
today the only way NF interacts with an interactive session.

Two deliberate boundaries make this safe and honest:

* **Off the ACP-owned SessionManager.** Represented sessions are NOT bridge
  ``Session`` objects. The ``SessionManager`` drives ACP children
  (reattach/resync/watchdog/idle-reaper); a phantom session there would invite
  that machinery to drive a process the bridge does not own. Represented event
  logs live in a separate in-memory ``LiveEventStore`` keyed by session id.

* **In-memory only (``EventLog(db=None)``).** The ``events`` table has a
  ``FOREIGN KEY -> sessions(id)`` under ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON``, so a
  represented id (which has no ``sessions`` row) cannot persist there. Durability
  is unnecessary: NF seeds **cold history from the on-disk transcript** and the
  represented log carries only the **live tail** (honest reduced fidelity). A
  bridge restart simply clears the tail; the extension re-registers and resumes.

The translation is intentionally lower-fidelity than native ACP: streaming
deltas, plans, and raw tool arguments/results are thinned or dropped in favor of
a faithful, safe view. The load-bearing safety line is **permissions**: a
represented ``permission.requested`` is surfaced read-only, carrying *no*
correlation id, so it is structurally unanswerable by a remote viewer --
approval can only ever happen at the operator's terminal.
