# Delegated-agent contract

This document freezes the semantic baseline for controlling an agent through
agent-bridge. It separates what the bridge **does today** from the compact
delegation contract it is converging toward.

The target is native-sub-agent-like control semantics over agent-bridge's
broader execution substrate. It does not replace the existing CLI, HTTP/SSE,
ACP, Session Host, or future AHP contracts. It gives those surfaces one shared
meaning for identity, reading, steering, waiting, interruption, and retirement.

## Contract ownership

| Concern | Owner |

No new writer or default may rely on the target contract until its selected
generation is registered and gated through #1460/#1468.

## Current surface

The current bridge exposes session-oriented mechanisms rather than one
delegated-agent facade.

| Intent | Current CLI | Current authenticated API | Current result |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Create a fresh session | `create <agent> [prompt]` | `POST /api/v1/sessions` with `force_new` as needed | Bridge `session_id`, generated display name, session status |
| Reuse or create for this caller | `send <agent> <prompt>` | Client-side resolve/reuse followed by session creation when absent | Existing or new bridge session |
| Submit a turn | `send <session> <prompt>` | `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/turns` | Immediate `turn_index`, or a queued result when `queue=true` |
| Handle a busy hosted session | Default `send` refuses; `send ... --queue` preserves the turn; `send ... --force` ends/replaces it | Default prompt submission returns 409; `queue=true` persists FIFO work | Reject, queue identity/position, or a fresh unlinked session depending on the explicit mode |
| Manage pending prompts | Queue flags through `send` | Queue snapshot, delete-one, and clear-all endpoints | Durable FIFO queue maintenance |
| Observe a live turn | attached `send`, bare `wait`, or following `read` | `GET .../events` plus cursor acknowledgement | Collapsed event stream |
| Wait for selected attention | `wait --attention REASON` / `--all-attention`, optionally `--json` and `--position` | Authenticated `GET .../attention` with repeatable reasons, opaque position, and bounded timeout | Structured earliest-boundary settlement; human mode flushes the SSE feed through the boundary, JSON mode remains cursor-neutral |
| Read accumulated events | `read`, `read --since`, `--tail`, `--range`, or `--event` | `GET .../events` or `GET .../events/range` | Event records; random access does not move the caller cursor |
| Read a bounded accumulated result | `result`, optionally from an opaque `--position` or with explicit `--expand` | `GET .../result` and `GET .../result/detail` | Current state, latest completed result, collapsed incremental work, and a cursor-neutral opaque next position |
| Inspect the downstream transcript without launching ACP | `peek` | Target-execution helper, not a public session route | Bounded Copilot `events.jsonl` snapshot and reuse verdict |
| Inspect current state | `status`, `session-usage`, `sessions` | Session, status, usage, queue, and cursor endpoints | Session/process/usage/progress fields |
| Interrupt one turn | control API; destructive `send --force` is a separate replacement path | `POST .../interrupt` | Current turn receives ACP `session/cancel`; session remains usable |
| Stop and preserve | `stop` | `POST .../stop` | Session becomes `stopped` and remains resumable |
| Resume | `resume` or automatic resume on later send | `POST .../resume` | Session returns to `idle` when recovery succeeds |
| End and remove | `end` | `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{id}` | Bridge-owned session state is retired |
| Answer agent input | `answer` | `POST .../ask-user` | Parked elicitation resumes |
| Answer a manual permission | No dedicated CLI verb yet | `POST .../permission` with correlated request and option IDs | Parked permission resumes and emits durable resolution |
| Hand off context | `handoff` | `POST .../handoff` | A successor session is created and linked |
| Rebuild a damaged relay log | No CLI verb; the watchdog may trigger it internally | Authenticated `POST .../resync` | Event log is rebuilt from downstream replay and delivery cursors reset |
| Message a represented interactive session | `send <live-handle>` | `POST /api/v1/live-sessions/{id}/messages` | Durable inbox message ID; optional waited reply |

## Current identity model

Several identifiers coexist today:

| Identity | Meaning today | Stability |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| `agent_name` | Resolver/catalog target selected by a caller | Stable catalog name, not a conversation |
| bridge `session_id` | Primary CLI/HTTP handle for one bridge session row | Durable across stop/resume; explicit handoff creates a successor; `send --force` may instead replace a busy session without a succession link |
| ACP `session_id` | Downstream runtime's persisted conversation identity | Internal to the bridge session; may be recreated only through explicit recovery behavior |
| `worktree_id` | Ground-layer working-body identity, ownership boundary, and session-head scope | May host a succession of bridge-owned or interactive sessions |
| `caller_id` | Caller-affinity and delivery-cursor key | Stable only when the caller supplies or resolves it consistently |
| live interactive `session_id` | Extension registration for one running CLI process | Lease-bound and invalidated by expiry/takeover |
| worktree handle | Resolves the current ground-layer head for owned resume/handoff and the current registration for represented messaging | Stable cross-handoff address when the managed worktree is authoritative |

The target contract exposes a **logical delegated-agent reference** derived
from an existing authority rather than adding a rival mutable identity:

- For a managed worktree, the qualified ground-layer worktree identity and its
  current head/lineage are authoritative.
- For a target with no managed worktree, the initial bridge session is the
  lineage root and bridge-owned succession links remain authoritative.
- One logical delegate reference names one caller-visible line of work.
- Stop/resume preserves both logical delegate and bridge session identity.
- Handoff preserves the logical delegate but creates an explicit successor
  bridge session.
- The result of every control operation carries both the logical delegate ID
  and current bridge session ID.
- A caller never infers logical identity from PID, transport, host, venue, or
  ACP session ID, and the bridge does not copy the ground layer's current-head
  state into a second authority.

Until the compact reference is exposed uniformly, callers use the current
bridge `session_id` for one hosted session or the authoritative worktree handle
when they need to follow a managed succession chain. The implementation gap is
uniform projection, not invention of another lineage store.

For ACP bridge-as-agent callers, `session/new` now also carries a small
`_meta["agent-bridge"].role` hint: `"owner"` when the bridge spawned a fresh
session for this connection, `"guest"` when this ACP connection adopted an
already-existing bridge session -- either explicitly (`/acp/session/<id>`) or by
automatically joining an occupied singleton-slot target (today `dispatch:`
first) instead of racing a second owner. The hint is descriptive, not a second
identity surface.

## Current lifecycle

`SessionStatus` currently defines:

```text
created -> starting -> idle <-> running -> stopping -> stopped
                   \                    \             \
                    +--------------------+-------------> failed / ended
```

The exact reachable transitions are owned by `SessionManager`; the diagram is a
semantic summary, not a replacement state machine.

Session status, turn status, transport liveness, and caller attention are
different axes:

- **Session status** says whether the bridge session is starting, usable,
  running, stopped, failed, or ended.
- **Turn state** says whether one submitted prompt is active or settled.
- **Transport liveness** says whether the daemon, Session Host, downstream
  child, and ACP path remain reachable.
- **Attention** says whether a retained caller should be released to act.

Later implementations must not encode all four meanings in one overloaded
status enum.

## Current caller relationships

| Relationship | Current behavior | Target meaning |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Attached | `send`, `wait`, or following `read` keeps a CLI process consuming the event stream | The process is an active attention subscription and may be released at a selected boundary |
| Observer | Status and random-access reads inspect durable state without owning the turn | Reads do not create a future wake-up relationship or advance another caller's cursor |
| Represented interactive peer | A registered CLI extension polls a durable inbox and may inject a `session.send` turn | Prompt control is experimental until single-stream admission is proven |
| Detached | `--no-wait` returns after creation/submission | Work continues durably, but the bridge cannot later wake a caller invocation that no longer exists |

An attached operating-system process is currently the reliable bridge from
external completion back into a host agent's scheduler. Durable state preserves
the target; it does not manufacture a callback into a disappeared caller.

## Current wait behavior

Current `wait` means **wait for the current turn to settle**:

- It follows the SSE stream and caller delivery cursor.
- It returns when the session is `idle`, `stopped`, `ended`, or `failed` and no
  unread events remain beyond the local cursor.
- Recoverable service reconnection is retried and resumes from the acknowledged
  cursor.
- `ask_user_request` and permission events are observable, but they are not a
  first-class structured wait result; a parked request may leave the turn
  running.
- A timeout returns control while the remote turn may still be running.

Bare `wait` deliberately remains narrower than the explicit attention contract
for compatibility.

## Target attention contract

An **attention subscription** is an attached relationship with a declared set
of reasons that release the caller. It is separate from event delivery and from
session lifecycle.

The stable semantic reasons are:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `turn_complete` | The selected turn settled normally and its bounded result is available |
| `turn_cancelled` | The selected turn settled because it was explicitly interrupted |
| `failed` | The turn or logical delegate reached a non-recoverable failure |
| `input_required` | The agent is parked on an elicitation requiring caller input |
| `permission_required` | The agent is parked on a permission decision that the current host cannot resolve |
| `unreachable` | Recovery policy has exhausted a loss of reachability; a transient reconnect attempt is not this reason |
| `policy_required` | Context pressure, ownership conflict, or another declared policy requires a caller decision |
| `contract_changed` | A successor or recovered session cannot continue under the subscriber's selected contract |
| `stopped` | The session was deliberately preserved but is not currently executing |
| `ended` | The logical delegate or its current session was deliberately retired |

The reason-source matrix is:

| Reason | Durable authority | Correlation and resolution | Restart and current availability | Prerequisite owner |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `turn_complete` | First selected `turn_complete` event with a normal stop reason, paired with the completed turn row | Event boundary and bounded result reference | Durable and replayable | agent-bridge |
| `turn_cancelled` | `turn_complete.stop_reason` only when it explicitly proves cancellation; a generic `interrupted` event is evidence-limited | Event boundary and bounded result reference | Durable and replayable | agent-bridge |
| `failed` | Terminal `session_state_changed(status=failed)` plus its fatal/terminal evidence | Session and terminal event boundary | Durable and replayable; generic `error` does not settle | #22 for complete production evidence |
| `input_required` | `ask_user_request` | `tool_call_id`; `ask_user_resolved` or `ask_user_withdrawn` reports current availability | Boundary is durable; answerability is live and becomes `unknown_after_restart` when it cannot be recovered | agent-bridge |
| `permission_required` | Correlated `permission_request` | Stable `request_id`; `permission_resolved` reports current availability | Boundary is durable once correlation exists; legacy uncorrelated requests do not settle | #1450 implementation |
| `unreachable` | Explicit terminal reachability-exhausted event | Terminal event boundary | Durable and replayable; disconnected liveness alone never settles | #22 |
| `policy_required` | Dedicated durable policy-boundary event | Stable action/decision correlation and resolution event | Durable and replayable once an owner emits it; `context_critical` and warnings do not settle | Future policy-event owner |
| `contract_changed` | Explicit successor protocol/reason-set rejection while following `session_handoff` | Successor identity plus last predecessor boundary | Client-synthesized and ephemeral until session-pinned generations exist | #1460 and #1468 |
| `stopped` | Deliberate `session_state_changed(status=stopped)` | Session and transition event boundary | Durable and replayable, except a predecessor stop after handoff cannot beat compatible succession | agent-bridge |
| `ended` | Reserved for a retained deliberate-retirement tombstone | Session and terminal boundary | Gated: current `end` deletes the session and history, so attention wait must not claim replayability | Future terminal-retention owner |

Settlement is the earliest selected durable boundary after the supplied opaque
attention position. The position is distinct from a result position and carries
the logical delegate plus the observed lineage segment, session, event-log
continuity, and event boundary. Reissuing from the same position therefore
returns the same logical settlement even if current request availability or
session state has advanced. Exactly-once means deterministic logical
settlement, not exactly-once HTTP delivery.

A timeout is a non-settled bounded response carrying current identity and the
latest attention position. It is not an attention reason and does not assert a
terminal verdict.

Rules:

1. The subscriber chooses its attention-reason set; an interactive default may
   select all actionable reasons.
2. Settlement happens exactly once and carries the reason, logical delegate ID,
   current session ID, durable position, and any result/request/successor
   reference.
3. Recoverable daemon, frontend, SSH, Session Host, or ACP transport churn
   resumes inside the subscription and does not settle it.
4. Handoff carries the subscription to the successor when the selected contract
   remains compatible; otherwise it settles as `contract_changed`.
5. Observing an event does not itself advance a caller's durable cursor until
   the consumer acknowledges delivery.
6. A detached caller has no attention subscription. Later status and result
   reads must say so explicitly rather than implying a missed wake-up.
7. A queued steering operation is selected by its logical-message identity.
   When it later starts, the admission record gains the turn/current-session
   correlation that a waiter and bounded-result reader follow.

The current explicit implementation is HTTP protocol v10. Human CLI mode uses
the existing SSE stream as its only wait channel and probes the shared
cursor-neutral evaluator after rendered events are acknowledged. JSON mode uses
only the bounded attention request. The server scans durable evidence before
performing one bounded event-log wait; it never reads or advances a delivery
cursor.

## Target logical-message idempotency

The current represented-session inbox supports an `idempotency_key`, but the
ordinary hosted-session prompt queue does not. The current database index makes
that live-message key globally unique across the table. Repeating it with the
same session, sender, body, reply target, and kind returns the original message;
reusing it for different content or a different session returns an
`idempotency_conflict`.

The current live-message key is therefore a narrower transport record mechanism,
not yet the shared logical-message contract.

The target idempotency identity is:

```text
(logical delegate ID, sender identity, caller-supplied idempotency key)
```

Rules:

1. The key is opaque to the bridge and names one logical steering operation.
2. Repeating the same tuple with the same normalized operation and payload
   returns the original admission result.
3. Reusing the tuple with different semantic content is a conflict; it never
   creates a second turn.
4. The identity survives client retry, queueing, daemon restart, stop/resume,
   and successor handoff.
5. Handoff does not mint a new idempotency scope because the logical delegate
   remains the same.
6. The record is retained while the logical delegate remains addressable and
   for at least the negotiated compatibility/rollback window after retirement.
   #1460 owns the concrete retention and migration gate.
7. Every acknowledgement identifies whether the message started immediately or
   queued, plus its logical-message, queue, turn, and current-session identity
   when known.

## Compatibility posture

- This baseline changes no current command, endpoint, state writer, or default.
- Existing bridge session IDs and event cursors retain their current meanings.
- Most new semantics are additive and capability-gated until #1460's
  reader-first and mixed-version gates permit a writer.
- Rescoping live-message idempotency from one global key to
  `(logical delegate, sender, key)`, and carrying it across a successor, requires
  an explicit #1460-owned index/data migration and compatibility adapter. It is
  not a purely additive writer change.
- A session pins its selected contract for its lifetime; a successor negotiates
  and records its own compatible selection.
- AHP remains a separate upstream host contract and ACP remains a downstream
  agent contract. Both may carry this semantic model without being renamed or
  flattened into it.
- Reduced-fidelity targets report unsupported control or missing evidence
  explicitly instead of returning a success-shaped omission.
