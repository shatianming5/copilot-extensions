// Async, non-blocking session-metadata resolution for the agent-bridge
// extension. Split out from extension.mjs (which calls joinSession() at
// import time, making it hard to unit test directly) so this logic is
// exercised hermetically, the same way delivery.mjs already is.
//
// NEVER use execSync/execFileSync here. Those suspend the ENTIRE process --
// no I/O of any kind, including the host's own readiness/liveness handshake
// with the extension -- for as long as the child takes to exit. Resolving
// session metadata used to run four external spawns (git + three
// `agent-worktrees get` calls) sequentially via execSync/execFileSync, which
// could block the whole process for their combined timeout (up to ~29s).
// Confirmed live as the cause of a ready-timeout crash-loop: under
// facility-wide session contention (many Copilot processes competing for the
// same CPU), those blocking spawns ran long enough that the extension never
// reported ready in time, and the host killed + respawned it in a loop that
// never resolved on its own.
//
// `execFile` (callback-based, wrapped in a Promise) keeps every child async:
// the event loop stays free to service everything else while a spawn is in
// flight, so a slow one degrades registration latency, never extension
// readiness. The four calls also run in parallel (`Promise.all`), bounded by
// the single slowest one instead of their sum.
