# Root Channel

The root channel is the top-level channel every AHP server exposes. It carries global state — the agents the server provides, the terminals it manages, and host-level configuration — plus the catalogue events for sessions.

## URI

```
ahp-root://
```

Exactly one root channel exists per server. Clients SHOULD subscribe to it during the handshake via `initialSubscriptions` to receive the agent list, terminal list, and host config in the same round-trip.

## State

Subscribers receive a [`RootState`](/reference/root#rootstate) snapshot:

```typescript
RootState {
  agents: AgentInfo[]
  activeSessions?: number
  terminals?: TerminalInfo[]
  config?: RootConfigState
}
```

- `agents` — agent backends the server can speak to, including any `protectedResources` they require for authentication. See [Authentication](/specification/authentication).
- `activeSessions` — count of non-disposed sessions. Lightweight badge counter.
- `terminals` — lightweight per-terminal metadata for rendering a terminal manager UI without subscribing to every terminal. See [Terminal Channel](/specification/terminal-channel) for the full state.
- `config` — host-level configuration schema and current values.

The session list is **not** part of root state. Clients fetch it imperatively via [`listSessions`](/reference/root#listsessions) and patch it from `root/*` notifications described below.

### Paginating the catalogue

A large catalogue can be fetched incrementally. [`listSessions`](/reference/root#listsessions) accepts an optional `limit` (the maximum number of entries the client wants in the page — the server SHOULD respect it, but MAY return fewer and MAY impose its own upper cap) and an optional opaque `cursor`. The result carries the page in `items` plus an optional `nextCursor`:

- To fetch the first page, omit `cursor`. Supply `limit` to bound the page size.
- If the result includes a `nextCursor`, more entries exist — pass it back as `cursor` on the next call to fetch the following page.
- A missing `nextCursor` signals the end of the catalogue.

The cursor is **opaque and server-defined**: the server picks the ordering and keyset. Clients MUST NOT parse, modify, or persist a cursor across connections. An unrecognised cursor SHOULD be rejected with an `InvalidParams` error. The server SHOULD return most-recently-modified entries first, so the first page is the immediately useful one.

Pagination is fully additive. A client that omits `limit`/`cursor` and ignores `nextCursor` sees the pre-pagination behaviour (subject to any server-imposed cap), and a server that does not paginate ignores the inputs and returns everything in one page. Pagination governs only the initial and backfill fetches — the `root/session*` notifications keep an already-loaded page live exactly as before.

## Methods and events on this channel

This section lists wire methods that are interpreted in the context of
`ahp-root://`. If `params.channel` is some other URI, they are handled by the
target channel instead.

### Commands (`params.channel = "ahp-root://"`)

| Method | Kind | Why it belongs on root |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | request | Connection-level handshake command; scoped to the root channel. |
| `ping` | request | Connection liveness check; scoped to the root channel. |
| `reconnect` | request | Connection resume/replay negotiation; scoped to the root channel. |
| `listSessions` | request | Session catalogue lives on root (`root/session*` events keep the cache fresh). |
| `resourceRead` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client** to fetch from a client-published URI. |
| `resourceWrite` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client** for host-driven per-session FS providers. |
| `resourceList` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceCopy` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceDelete` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceMove` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceResolve` | request | `stat` + `realpath` combination; throws `NotFound` for missing URIs. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceMkdir` | request | `mkdir -p` semantics. May also be issued **server → client**. |
| `resourceRequest` | request | Permission grant/revocation flow is connection-level. Symmetrical: either peer MAY initiate. |
| `createResourceWatch` | request | Opens a file-change watcher; the receiver returns an `ahp-resource-watch:/<id>` channel. May also be issued **server → client** to watch a client-side URI. The watcher is released when subscribers unsubscribe — no explicit dispose call. |
| `authenticate` | request | Bearer-token push for protected resources is connection-level. |
| `resolveSessionConfig` | request | Pre-creation config resolution happens before any session channel exists. |
| `sessionConfigCompletions` | request | Completes dynamic fields in pre-creation session config. |

### Notifications (`params.channel = "ahp-root://"`)

| Method | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | server → client notification | Root-scoped action envelope (`root/*` action payloads). |
| `root/sessionAdded` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry created. |
| `root/sessionRemoved` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry removed. |
| `root/sessionSummaryChanged` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry mutated. |
| `root/progress` | server → client notification | Generic progress for a long-running operation a client opted into (e.g. an SDK download). |
| `unsubscribe` | client → server notification | Stop receiving root-channel messages. |
| `dispatchAction` | client → server notification | Dispatch a root-scoped client action (currently `root/configChanged`). |

`auth/required` may also be emitted on `ahp-root://` when the auth requirement
is root-scoped; see [Authentication](/specification/authentication).

## Actions

Root state is mutated by action envelopes broadcast on this channel. Refer to the [Root Channel Reference](/reference/root#actions) for the full list; the root-scoped actions are:

| Action                       | Direction       | Reducer effect                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `root/agentsChanged`         | Server          | Replaces `agents`                    |
| `root/activeSessionsChanged` | Server          | Replaces `activeSessions`            |
| `root/terminalsChanged`      | Server          | Replaces `terminals`                 |
| `root/configChanged`         | Server / Client | Merges (or replaces) `config.values` |

All root-scoped action envelopes have `channel: "ahp-root://"`.

## Protocol Notifications

In addition to action envelopes, the server pushes per-session catalogue events to subscribers of `ahp-root://`. These notifications keep cached session lists in sync without subscribing to every session URI individually.

### `root/sessionAdded`

Emitted when a new session is created.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionAdded",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "summary": {
      "resource": "ahp-session:/<uuid>",
      "title": "New Session",
      "status": 1,
      "createdAt": "2024-03-09T16:00:00.000Z",
      "modifiedAt": "2024-03-09T16:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### `root/sessionRemoved`

Emitted when a session is disposed.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionRemoved",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "session": "ahp-session:/<uuid>"
  }
}
```

### `root/sessionSummaryChanged`

Emitted when any mutable field on an existing [`SessionSummary`](/reference/session#sessionsummary) changes (title, status, `modifiedAt`, working directory, read/done state, change statistics, …). Only the changed fields are carried; identity fields (`resource`, `provider`, `createdAt`) never change and MUST be omitted.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionSummaryChanged",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "session": "ahp-session:/<uuid>",
    "changes": {
      "title": "Refactor auth middleware",
      "status": 8,
      "modifiedAt": "2024-03-09T16:02:03.456Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Servers MAY coalesce or debounce this notification for noisy fields — for example, rapid `modifiedAt` bumps during a streaming turn, or frequent `changes` updates during an edit burst. Clients that have no cached entry for `session` MAY ignore the notification.

Like all protocol notifications, the `root/*` events are ephemeral and are **not** replayed on reconnect. After reconnecting, clients SHOULD re-fetch the catalogue via [`listSessions`](/reference/root#listsessions).

## Progress

The server MAY emit `root/progress` to report incremental progress on a long-running operation a client opted into — most notably the lazy, first-use download of an agent's native SDK. A client opts in by supplying a `progressToken` on the originating request (today the `progressToken` field of [`createSession`](/reference/session#createsession)); the server echoes that token on every frame so the client can correlate progress back to the call and the UI awaiting it. The notification is operation-agnostic — it names no domain object.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/progress",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "progressToken": "9b2c1f7e-4a0d-4e2b-8b1a-2f7e4a0d4e2b",
    "progress": 18874368,
    "total": 41957498,
    "message": "Downloading Claude agent…"
  }
}
```

`progress` is monotonically non-decreasing for a given `progressToken`. `total` is present only when the magnitude is known up front (e.g. a `Content-Length`); when absent, clients SHOULD show an indeterminate indicator. The operation is complete when `progress === total` — the server MUST emit a final frame satisfying this, setting `total` to the final `progress` when the total was never known, after which no further frames reference the token. An optional `message` carries a human-readable description of the work in progress; a client that tracks the token renders its own (localized) label and MAY ignore it, while a generic client MAY display `message` verbatim. The server MAY emit no progress at all (for example when the work was already done), in which case the client simply never shows an indicator. Like the catalogue events, `root/progress` is ephemeral and is **not** replayed on reconnect.

## Authentication Events

The server MAY emit [`auth/required`](/specification/authentication#auth-expiry-notification) on the root channel when an agent's protected resource needs (re-)authentication. See [Authentication](/specification/authentication) for the full flow.
