"""Tests for the write-side session-lineage helper (worktree-self-knowledge
Phase 4).

agent-bridge contributes the ACP session's lifecycle *facts* to the
agent-worktrees ground layer (register + link-succession + note-handoff) so the
derived head is correct on the ACP path, and reads the successor's role + the
worktree history digest to seed its lineage awareness (the ``sessionStart``
role/digest hook cannot fire under ``copilot --acp``). Every path is fail-open.

These tests cover the pure seed-header composition and the fail-open subprocess
wrappers (argv shape + degrade-to-no-op), without spawning the real binstub.
