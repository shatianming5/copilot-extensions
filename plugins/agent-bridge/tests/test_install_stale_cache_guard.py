"""Regression guard: agent-bridge's local `[tool.uv.sources]` path deps
(ssh-manager, credential-relay, zdd, single-instance-lease, config-migrate,
agent-procutil, and agent-bridge itself) must always force a fresh `uv`
build/install, never a possibly-stale cached wheel.

`uv pip install` on a local PATH source caches its build keyed by source
path, not source content -- a stale wheel from a prior build can silently be
served instead of a fresh one. This is the confirmed root cause behind
ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2863 (agent-dispatch's identical exposure),
and `agent-procutil` specifically was directly implicated in a live
LAUNCH_ACP "session host exited early" incident on the same host during the
same outage window: `session_host/launcher.py` imports `agent_procutil` at
module level, so a stale build there crashes every headless-spawn session
host launch, invisibly to any health check that never imports it.

`agent-procutil` has no dedicated install call of its own in either
installer (it is only ever resolved transitively while installing
agent-bridge), so its cache-bust must ride on the final agent-bridge
package install call specifically.

These are static-text guards (following the precedent set in
agent-dispatch's `test_install_health_gate.py`), checked at both call sites
in each installer (the initial-install path and the update path).
