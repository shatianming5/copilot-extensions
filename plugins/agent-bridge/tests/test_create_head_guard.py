"""Tests for the session-lifecycle create guard (agent-fabric
`single-current-session-per-worktree`).

Creating a session *into an existing worktree* whose ground-layer head is still
``active`` is refused with a structured 409 enumerating reuse / handoff /
sunset. ``create`` has no break-glass override of its own
(agent-bridge-cold-resume Phase 3) -- the guard's ``override`` field points at
``resume ... --force`` instead. The head is *derived* from agent-worktrees (via
``worktree_head.resolve_head``) -- the guard keeps no rival pointer and fails
**open** when the ground layer can't be read.

This is the create-time sibling of the ``resume_worktree`` liveness guard
(``live_cli_holds_worktree``); together they enforce one current session per
worktree.
