"""The daemon's own real generation id must reach ``running-version.json``
once its ``SessionManager`` boots (see ``runtime_version.py``'s own module
docstring for why this file, not ``/health``).

Drives the app through a REAL lifespan (``TestClient`` as a context manager,
not a bare app object) so this exercises the actual boot sequence:
``write_running_version()`` (no id yet) followed by ``session_manager_from_
config()`` constructing the real ``SessionManager``, then this module's
follow-up call recording its real, just-computed id.

Two ``enable_credential_relay=False`` shapes exist and must be told apart: a
``--passive`` ZDD-cutover successor (``app.state.passive = True``, the
existing launch-state flag ``service_start_cli.py`` already sets) DOES get
promoted and stages its id for later promotion-time consumption; an elevated
sub-daemon (``app.state.passive`` absent/``False``) shares the primary's
runtime dir and is NEVER promoted, so it must not touch anything at all.
