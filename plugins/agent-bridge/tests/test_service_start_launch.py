"""Fallback daemon spawn resolves a real executable, never a bare name (#4432).

``_service_start``'s no-systemd/no-scheduled-task fallback used to
``subprocess.Popen(["agent-bridge", "start"])`` -- a bare, extensionless command
name. On Windows the on-PATH artifact is ``agent-bridge.cmd`` and
``CreateProcess`` does not apply PATHEXT, so the spawn failed with WinError 2 and
(because ``service restart`` stops first) left the bridge down. The launch argv
must invoke the interpreter directly (``python -m agent_bridge start``) so it
never routes through the ``.cmd`` shim.

    function was unconditional even though its only use is inside an
    ``if sys.platform == "win32":`` guard further down -- ``windows_proactor``
    only defines that name inside its own matching guard, so any non-Windows
    platform hit an immediate ``ImportError`` before the daemon could even
    bind a socket. Exercise the real function up through every one of its
    top-of-body imports (stopping cleanly at the first controllable exit
    point, the singleton guard) rather than re-deriving the import list,
    so a reintroduced unconditional import fails this test the same way it
    failed the real daemon.

    Stubs the two real-process side effects ``_cmd_start`` performs before
    reaching that exit point (the kill-on-close job attach and a CWD
    ``chdir`` into the config dir) -- neither is what this test is about,
    and leaving them live would attach the pytest worker to a real Job
