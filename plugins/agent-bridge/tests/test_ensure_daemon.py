"""On-demand daemon ensure -- a daemon-touching command self-heals (#1713 Slice 3).

When the daemon is down, ``_get_client()`` boots it first so ``send``/``wait``/
``read``/``agents``/``sessions`` self-heal a crash / idle-exit / missing restart
task -- rather than failing. Pure reporters (``status``) pass ``ensure=False`` and
must never boot what they report on. Guarded by a kill switch, crash-loop
backoff, and single-flight.

    # `agent_bridge.__main__` import time, before conftest's
    # `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONFIG_DIR` env-var isolation fixture ever runs -- so that
    # fixture cannot retarget it, and `_service_process_is_live()` /
    # `_reconcile_live_dynamic_daemon()` keep reading the host's real PID file
    # and routing table. On a dev box where the production daemon happens to
    # be running, that makes `_ensure_daemon()` take the "already starting"
    # branch instead of the test's own mocked `_spawn_detached_daemon()` path,
    # then busy-loop `_wait_for_service_start()` for real wall-clock seconds

    # on a `_service_is_running()` state the test's own mock can never flip,
    # observed live as both a spurious failure and an ~8-minute test-file
    # slowdown. Tests exercise liveness purely through `_service_is_running`
    # and `_spawn_detached_daemon`; these two signals default to "no live
    # process out there" so that path is deterministic regardless of host
