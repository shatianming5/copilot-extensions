    The auto-claim in ``agent-codespaces ssh`` shells out to ``agent-worktrees``
    (to resolve the calling worktree + enumerate active worktrees) and writes the
    real host lease file. Unit tests that exercise the ``ssh`` CLI must not do
    real subprocess I/O or touch host state, so claiming is off by default. Tests
    that specifically cover claim enforcement opt back in by deleting the env var

    None (holder unknown -> L2 skipped) and every lease op reports UNAVAILABLE
    (the degrade-safe path), so claim/release/heartbeat behave exactly as the
