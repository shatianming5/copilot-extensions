"""``agent-codespaces copilot <name> --detach`` / ``--stop`` -- a CLI-mode
Copilot session an *agent* can start, observe, steer and stop without handing
over its own terminal.

The attached ``copilot`` verb (:mod:`agent_codespaces.copilot_venue`) gives a
human the remote muxed session in their terminal. An orchestrating agent needs
the same session without a TTY, surviving the launcher's exit. Everything here
composes existing machinery rather than adding a parallel path:

* ``_ssh_session`` (the ``ssh`` verb's body) supplies the claim, target lock
  and full dispatch-grade venue preparation, then runs the remote
  ``agent-worktrees embody`` -- the detached twin of ``agent-worktrees
  copilot`` -- with the staged CodeSpace plugins folded in as
  ``--copilot-arg=--plugin-dir=...``;
* the Connection Owner keeps the credential relay **and** a host-bridge-daemon
  forward alive for the session's lifetime (a *session tenant* it renews from
  its own venue probe -- :mod:`agent_codespaces.session_forwards`);
* the host bridge's CLI-mode reservation, keyed by a venue-qualified identity
  (``<identity>@<codespace>``) and carrying the venue descriptor, tells the
  launcher exactly which live session registered.

Success is reported once the session is represented on the host bridge (the
reservation was claimed). If the TTY seed could not be typed before that, the
same bridge message lane used for reference-file notes delivers it after
registration; only an unregistered created session is torn down.
