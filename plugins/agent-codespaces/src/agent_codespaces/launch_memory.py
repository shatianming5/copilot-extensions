"""Keep a detached session's launch flags for a later launch that omits them.

A rejoin keeps a session's forwards (the Connection Owner holds them). Its
Copilot flags (``--model``, ``--reasoning-effort``, ``--no-ask-user``, ...) and
``--driver`` were not kept anywhere: a resume that passed only ``--resume`` --
a supervisor's wake after a CodeSpace stop, or a hand recovery -- came back on
this host's default model and without them. And the Owner releases a stopped
CodeSpace's session tenants, so its hold can't carry them across a stop.

So a launch that actually starts a session records what it was started with,
and which session that is, one file per CodeSpace and session tenant under
``~/.agent-codespaces/launches/``. A later launch that resumes *that* session
by id and asks for nothing else -- a session selector naming it, no other
``--copilot-arg``, no ``--driver`` -- reuses the record. Anything else
starts from what it was given: a new session, a resume of a different session
(it never borrows another session's flags), ``--continue`` (no id to match),
or explicit flags. A rejoin of a session that's already running changes
nothing (its flags weren't applied), so it doesn't touch the record either.

Its ``--forward`` ports (a worker's dev server, say) go the same way, but the
Owner releases them with the stopped CodeSpace too: a resume of the recorded
session that gives no ``--forward`` gets them back (see
:func:`recall_forwards`), and a rejoin that sets them -- the Owner replaces a
hold's forwards -- records the new ones. Reverse forwards are never recorded.
