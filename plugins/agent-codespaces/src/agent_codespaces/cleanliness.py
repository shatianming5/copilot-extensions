"""CodeSpace at-rest cleanliness predicate + probe (resource-obligation-settlement Ph3b).

A worktree answers for a CodeSpace it borrowed before it may finalize
(agent-fabric ``resource-accountability``). A CodeSpace reaches **at-rest** when
its *work is safe* -- merged or off-box -- **not** when it is deleted (an at-rest
CodeSpace may keep running, its claim released for the next borrower). This
module decides that: given a CodeSpace's git state (uncommitted changes, unpushed
commits, branches with commits not on their upstream) and whether a dispatch is
still in-flight, is the CodeSpace **safe to settle**?

Like ``fence.py`` this is pure decision logic + a shell probe builder + a
defensive parser; the caller runs the probe over the existing SSH channel and
settles the obligation (via ``agent-worktrees claims settle`` / the lease
``--disposition`` mirror) only on a *definitive* at-rest verdict. **Conservative
by construction:** anything the probe cannot determine reads as **not** at-rest,
so an un-probeable CodeSpace stays an active (blocking) obligation rather than
being settled blind.

    Scans **every** git repo under ``workspace_glob`` (not just the first --
    a borrowed CodeSpace typically holds both the scaffold repo and the actual
    work repo, and unpushed work in *any* of them keeps the CodeSpace unsafe)

    :data:`config.DOTFILES_DIR`) and prints ``OBLIGATION_PROBE=1`` plus the

    * ``DIRTY``   -- ``1`` if **any** repo has uncommitted changes.
    * ``AHEAD``   -- total commits reachable from **HEAD** that exist on **no
      remote** (``git rev-list --count HEAD --not --remotes``), summed across
      repos. This is the accountability-correct "local-only work on the checked-
      out line" -- unlike ``@{u}..HEAD`` it is well-defined even when the branch
      has **no upstream** (a common CodeSpace state), where ``@{u}`` errors to 0
      and would falsely read as clean.
    * ``UNPUSHED_BRANCHES`` -- count of local branches (across all repos) that
      carry commits on no remote (``<branch> --not --remotes`` > 0) -- work
      parked off the pushed line.

    Emits nothing when no repo is found (the parser then degrades to
    ``known=False``). Read-only: never mutates a repo.

    ``workspace_glob`` is interpolated **unquoted** so the shell expands ``*``
    (``shopt -s nullglob`` makes an unmatched glob vanish rather than pass a
    literal). It is a trusted, code-supplied value (the default or an internal
    override), never user input -- do **not** ``shlex.quote`` it, or the glob is
    single-quoted and never expands (which silently disabled the probe on every
    real CodeSpace).

    ``extra_dirs`` exists because ``workspace_glob``'s bare ``*`` **cannot**
    reach the dotfiles checkout even with ``nullglob``: the dotfiles clone
    lives three levels under a dot-prefixed directory
    (``/workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles``), and bash's default
    (non-``dotglob``) pathname expansion never matches a name beginning with
    ``.`` -- confirmed live: ``/workspaces/*/.git`` matched a sibling product
    repo but silently skipped the dotfiles ``.git`` next to it. A missing
    ``extra_dirs`` entry on a given box is not an error: the same
    git-dir-not-found skip that already handles a non-repo glob match applies
    here too.
