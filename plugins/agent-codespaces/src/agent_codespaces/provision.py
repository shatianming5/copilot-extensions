"""Repo provisioning hooks -- deploy repo-declared files on SSH connect.

An adopting repo declares a ``provision`` block in its
``.copilot-extensions/agent-codespaces/config.yaml`` to deploy its own files
(e.g. shell env
snippets) and run setup commands into a CodeSpace on every
``agent-codespaces ssh`` connect. This replaces bespoke per-repo SSH wrappers:
the repo-specific extras become data the plugin applies by convention.

Generic relay setup (ado-auth-helper-relay + wrapper) is handled
separately in :mod:`agent_codespaces.codespace_assets`.
