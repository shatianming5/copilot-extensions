"""agent-codespaces config-schema migration wiring.

Plugin-side adapter over the vendored ``config_migrate`` library (see
``libs/config-migrate``). agent-codespaces keeps almost all configuration in
**adopting repos** (`.copilot-extensions/agent-codespaces/config.yaml`, with
legacy fallbacks)
-- that is repo-committed, so migrating its schema is an ``adopt`` concern,
never install/update. The only **machine-local** persisted YAML is the adoption
manifest ``~/.agent-codespaces/adopted-repos.yaml`` (a list of adopted repo
paths); that is what this module versions.

Two call sites, one registry (mirroring the agent-worktrees exemplar):

* the loader (``config.load_adopted_repos``) calls ``migrate_loaded`` on read
  (lazy, never-raises) so a still-old manifest loads at the current shape before
  ``install``/``update`` has rewritten it;
* the installer calls ``run_migrations`` once (eager) to stamp/upgrade the
  manifest on disk, and ``config.save_adopted_repos`` stamps the current version
  so the marker round-trips through a normal save.

Baseline (R1): registered at **v1** with no migrators -- the first migrate
merely stamps ``schema_version: 1``. The whole module is import-guarded: if the
vendored library is absent, every entry point degrades to a safe no-op.
