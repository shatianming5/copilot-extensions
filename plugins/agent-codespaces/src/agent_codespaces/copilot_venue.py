    registration credentials there, all before ever opening the interactive
    connection.

    Two distinct gaps, closed in the same round trip:

    1. Without the ``agent-bridge`` plugin loaded in the *remote* Copilot
       process, that process never even attempts to self-register (confirmed
       live: a real CodeSpace session ran for 5+ minutes with zero
       registration, purely because this was missing).
    2. Even with the plugin loaded, the interactive extension's own
       ``resolveToken()``/``resolveBaseUrl()`` (``extension.mjs``) read
       ``~/.agent-bridge/auth.yaml``/``active.json`` -- files that exist only
       on the machine actually running the daemon. A remote venue never has
       them, so the extension logs "no local agent-bridge auth token found;
       not registering (ok)" and silently never calls the registration
       endpoint at all -- confirmed live (agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions
       Phase 4 follow-up): a real CodeSpace session loaded the extension,
       reached a ready prompt, and still never registered, for exactly this
       reason (a distinct bug from #1, and layered underneath it -- fixing
       only #1 still leaves CLI-mode registration silently broken).

    Both are preconditions of the `copilot` verb's own contract, not a
    project policy choice, so both are applied unconditionally here -- no
    `--fix`/opt-in needed. Best-effort throughout: any probe/install/
    provisioning failure is reported but never blocks the connection attempt
    (the operator may still want to attach and diagnose by hand).

    The venue counterpart to ``agent-worktrees copilot`` (PR #3126) --
    ``agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`` Phase 4: reserves the worktree's
    CLI-mode Session Host slot on the host ``agent-bridge`` daemon, places a
    Connection Owner tenant hold (spinning the Owner up on-demand) so the
    daemon-port + credential-relay reverse forwards ride one durable
    connection, re-heartbeats that hold for as long as this process stays
    attached (self-hosted tenancy -- no agent-bridge daemon involvement), and
    SSHes ``-t`` into the CodeSpace to run ``agent-worktrees copilot`` there --
    identical contract to the local verb, just dispatched remotely.

    Defaults to **anchor mode** (no ``--worktree-id``): a CodeSpace is
    conventionally anchor-only (the devcontainer already clones the repo
    directly; no worktree exists unless an operator explicitly created one
    with ``agent-worktrees create`` inside it), so forcing ``--worktree-id``
    on every caller would be needless ceremony for the common case. This
    mirrors headless ACP dispatch's own existing behavior of running
    straight in the venue's ``workspace_folder``, never a worktree.

    ``interactive_ssh`` is injected (``__main__._interactive_ssh``) rather than
    imported, to avoid a circular import between this module and ``__main__``.

    Before connecting, implicitly ensures the ``agent-bridge`` Copilot
    plugin is installed on the venue (see ``_ensure_agent_bridge_plugin``) --
    a single-shot prep step so an operator/caller never has to run
    ``agent-codespaces doctor --fix`` by hand before their first CLI-mode
    session on a given CodeSpace.

    Also enforces the SAME exclusive, worktree-keyed CodeSpace claim
    ``agent-codespaces ssh`` already does (via the shared
    ``lease.claim_for_connect`` choke point) before ever attempting to
    connect. Previously this verb never claimed at all: a live claim held by
    one worktree/machine was silently bypassable simply by using `copilot`
    instead of `ssh` to drive the same CodeSpace -- confirmed live
    (agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions Phase 4 follow-up): a CLI-mode session
    was driven successfully on a CodeSpace a different, still-live worktree
    on another machine had legitimately claimed, disrupting its in-flight
    work.

    Also acquires the SAME same-machine, cross-process ``ssh-manager``
    ``TargetLock`` ``agent-codespaces ssh`` already does, guarding the
    shared credential-relay reverse-forward this verb rides just like
    ``ssh`` does -- previously only ``ssh`` serialized concurrent local
    processes against this collision (a second local `copilot`/`ssh`
    invocation against the same CodeSpace could collide on the relay port
    and collapse the first one's connection); `copilot` never took this
    lock at all, even though `agent-containers`' own `copilot` verb already
    does (this fix brings the two venues' `copilot` verbs into consistent
    parity on this same-machine axis too).

    ``--detach`` / ``--stop`` hand off to :mod:`agent_codespaces.copilot_detach`
    (the agent-facing, no-TTY lifecycle); ``ssh_session`` is injected for it
    for the same no-circular-import reason as ``interactive_ssh``.
