"""Namespace resolver for GitHub Codespaces.

Implements the agent-bridge ``NamespaceResolver`` interface so that
codespace agents can be addressed as ``codespace:<name>`` without
pre-registration. The resolver queries ``gh codespace list`` on demand
and builds SpawnTargets that launch ``agent-codespaces ssh --stdio``.

Usage:
    from agent_codespaces.resolver import CodespaceResolver

    resolver = CodespaceResolver()
    bridge_resolver.register_namespace_resolver(resolver)

    # Then: agent-bridge send codespace:my-cs-name "do the work"
