"""Recover a CodeSpace's Copilot session-state into the agent-logger hub.

Pulls ``~/.copilot`` session data (the ``session-state/`` tree plus the
``session-store.db*`` index files -- never credentials, keys, or settings) off a
CodeSpace over the multiplexed SSH connection, then lands it in the configured
agent-logger storage target under ``.codespaces/<name>`` by shelling out to the
``session-sync push`` CLI (agent-logger).

This keeps the two plugins decoupled with no shared venv: agent-codespaces owns
the CodeSpace/SSH pull; agent-logger owns the storage pattern. The binary
``tar`` payload is transferred base64-wrapped in sentinels so stray banner/log
text on the SSH channel can never corrupt it (a real failure mode -- see the
dotfiles ``sync-copilot-sessions.ps1`` history).

    """Non-destructive, non-lifecycle-transition session capture: pull a
    CodeSpace's Copilot session-state while it stays leased and running.

    This is the CodeSpaces peer to ``agent-containers``' ``rescue-capture``
    (``ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3574``) -- session-rescue-parity
    Phase 3. Unlike :func:`sync_codespace_sessions`, this function:

    - **never boots or connects to a non-``Available`` CodeSpace.** A hard
      preflight (list/inspect state only) defers immediately for any state
      other than ``Available`` -- this is capture-only-shaped, not
      destroy/finalize-shaped; it never reuses
      :func:`sync_codespace_sessions`'s boot-tolerant ``skip_if_shutdown``
      special-case, which still boots every OTHER non-Shutdown,
      non-Available state.
    - **defers on any active hold** (local lease, ``#897`` claim,
      cross-machine L2, beacon) regardless of holder identity, checked BOTH
      up front and again immediately after the SSH target lock is acquired
      -- the up-front check runs before any lock exists, so it alone cannot
      close the window where a hold appears between that check and the lock
      actually taking effect; the fence-time re-check does. See
      :func:`_capture_hold_reason`, which also fails closed (defers) on any
      read failure -- an *unknown* hold state is never treated as *unheld*.
    - **requires an unambiguous account**: an explicit ``account`` or a
      confirmed exact per-name binding (``account_binding.bound_account``)
      -- never ``get_codespace_status_with_account``'s generic
      multi-candidate scan, whose first-match semantics are exactly the
      same-name-across-accounts ambiguity this item exists to close. Fails
      closed (defers) when neither is available, and mints the connection
      token for that EXACT resolved account once, up front -- never letting
      ``CodespaceSource``/``env_for_account`` re-derive (and possibly
      silently ambient-fallback for) credentials moments later, which would
      let a same-named CodeSpace under the ambient account be read under
      this identity if minting failed between the preflight and the
      connect (mirroring ``claim_provider_cli.py``'s reclaim path).
    - **gates the pull on the vendored liveness probe both before AND
      after** the pull, never capturing a session whose state is anything
      but ``idle`` at either checkpoint. This narrows, but does not close,
      the underlying race: a session that both acquires AND releases its
      ``inuse.*.lock`` entirely within the pull's own duration is invisible
      to both probes alike -- an explicitly accepted residual risk for a
      periodic/advisory capture (session-rescue-parity Phase 1's recorded
      decision), identical in kind to what ``rescue-capture`` already
      accepts.
    - **re-checks the hold status too, both immediately after acquiring the
      SSH target lock and again after the pull completes.** A lease/claim
      is acquired through the separate lease/coordination store, never this
      ``TargetLock``, so a new holder can appear at any point up to and
      including while the pull itself is in flight; a failed re-check is
      treated the same as a found hold.

    Returns ``{ok, session_count, detail, deferred}``. Never raises.
