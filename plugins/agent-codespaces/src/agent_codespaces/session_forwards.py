"""Connection Owner support for detached venue CLI-mode sessions.

A detached ``agent-codespaces copilot <name> --detach`` session keeps running
in a CodeSpace mux session after its launcher exits. To stay registered with,
heartbeating to, and messageable through the *host* agent-bridge daemon it
needs two reverse forwards to outlive the launcher: the credential relay
(already the Connection Owner's job) and the host bridge daemon's own API port.

:class:`SessionForwards` is the Owner's optional extension for that:

* it keeps one self-healing reverse forward of the host bridge daemon per hold
  that asks for one (``OwnerHold.daemon_port``) -- the CodeSpace-side listen
  port stays fixed while the host side follows the daemon's *live* port, so a
  host bridge restart (which rebinds a fresh ephemeral port) does not strand
  the session; and
* it renews or releases **session tenants** from the Owner's own venue probe
  (does the recorded mux session still exist? is the CodeSpace still
  Available?) instead of any bridge/session state -- the Owner stays
  transport-only, and never wakes a CodeSpace that was stopped; and
* on that same probe, while the session is running, it checks the bridge
  forward actually serves (an authenticated round trip from the CodeSpace) and
  rebuilds one whose ssh process is alive but no longer forwards.
