"""Connection Owner registry -- durable, ref-counted ownership of a CodeSpace's
persistent connection (the credential relay + the exclusive claim), independent
of any single agent-bridge dispatch.

Background
----------
Three consumers share a machine's link to a CodeSpace and must coexist without
breaking each other: agent-bridge **dispatch** (ACP / Session-Host), the
**credential-relay**, and one-off ``agent-codespaces ssh`` commands. They do not
conflict over connectivity -- they conflict over two *single-owner* resources:
the relay ``-R`` bind (dotfiles#561) and the exclusive claim (dotfiles#897). The
fix is to give those a single durable **Connection Owner** and make the three
consumers non-owning **tenants**.

This module is **increment 1** of that design (dotfiles#1333): the registry +
lease / ref-count lifecycle *only*. It records, per (machine, CodeSpace), which
tenants currently need the durable connection and whether the relay is *pinned*,
and answers :func:`should_hold` ("keep the connection up?"). It does **not** open
or own a connection yet -- a later increment attaches the self-healing
``SupervisedRelayForward`` under this registry. Because nothing consumes it yet,
this module is purely additive and safe to land without a daemon cutover.

State of record mirrors :mod:`agent_codespaces.lease`: a host-side JSON file
(``~/.agent-codespaces/connection-owner.json``) guarded by an exclusive lock file
for race-safety across parallel worktree agents on the same machine, written
atomically.

Model
-----
A Connection Owner keeps one durable connection per CodeSpace on this machine
alive while there is any reason to:

* the credential relay is **pinned** (``pin=True`` -- the relay is the Owner's
  own always-on service while the CodeSpace should be able to authenticate), or
* at least one **tenant** currently needs it (a dispatch, a one-off ssh, ...).
  Tenants are ref-counted by id and heartbeated, so a forgotten tenant is
  reclaimed by TTL.

:func:`should_hold` = pinned **or** >= 1 live tenant. Only when it is ``False``
may a later increment tear the connection down.

    there can keep registering/heartbeating/receiving messages after its

    the Owner needs to renew it on its own: the remote ``mux_session`` whose
    existence keeps the tenant alive and an absolute ``expires_at`` lease cap.
