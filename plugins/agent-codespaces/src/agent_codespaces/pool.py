"""CodeSpace venue pool -- inventory, budget accounting & disposition model.

The venue provider's view of the account's CodeSpaces as a **finite, shared,
budget-bounded pool** rather than a set of isolated machines (see the
``agent-codespaces`` vision, effort ``codespace-venue-pool`` #705, this being
Phase 1 / #706).

This module owns **no store of its own** -- it *derives* the pool view at read
time from the signals the layers below already own (the fabric's
*derive-don't-duplicate*):

- ``lifecycle.list_codespaces()`` -- what CodeSpaces exist, their gh ``state``,
  machine spec, repository, and last-used time (merged across mapped accounts);
- ``lease.list_leases()`` -- the advisory effort->CodeSpace hold (the *in-use*
  signal) and its holder (effort + host);
- ``status.list_status()`` -- the finalize/prune lifecycle marker
  (recovered / prunable) from #164.

From those it computes, per CodeSpace, a **disposition** (in-use / idle / clean /
stale, plus the transient provisioning / failed) and its **allocation** (repo,
holding effort/worktree, machine), and across the pool a **budget** (the
account's concurrent-core ceiling, what running CodeSpaces spend against it, and
the remaining headroom). ``budget-not-exceeded`` and ``reuse-over-recreate``
(Phase 2 / #708) are the :func:`plan_allocation` planner in this module; the
Worktree Picker's CodeSpaces pivot (Phase 3 / #709) renders the derived view.

    decision -- the pure core of ``persist-for-workstream`` + ``budget-not-exceeded``
    (Phase 2b / #708, superseding Phase 2's cross-workstream reuse).

    ``workstream_box`` names the CodeSpace the requesting workstream (effort, or
    else its driving worktree) already claimed on a prior request, if any --
    resolved by the caller (see ``driving_worktrees.resolve_workstream_box``),
    never guessed here. Precedence (first match wins):

      1. **Resume** ``workstream_box`` when it is still in the pool -- this
         workstream's own persistent box, running or stopped, reused
         regardless of its disposition. A workstream never falls back to
         borrowing a DIFFERENT idle/clean box for ``repo`` just because one
         happens to be free: that box belongs to no one *yet*, not to this
         request, and grabbing it would strand whichever workstream created it
         once it comes looking for it again. When ``workstream_box`` no longer
         exists (recycled, deleted out of band), falls through to create.
      2. Else **create** a fresh box when the intended machine (``new_cores``)
         fits the headroom -- always a **new**, dedicated box for this
         workstream, never someone else's idle one.
      3. Else (no headroom) **recycle** a running *stale* box to reclaim its
         cores, then create -- but only when the reclaim actually makes the
         fresh create fit. (Staleness recycling itself is Phase 4 / #710; this
         planner only consumes the disposition, never decides *when* a box
         ages to stale.)
      4. Else **pressure**: the pool is full and nothing is recyclable --
         surface it (``N/M cores``) rather than silently over-provision or
         fail opaquely.

    Pure + side-effect-free (a planner, not an executor). ``new_cores`` is the
    intended new box's core cost; ``0``/unknown is treated as a conservative
    ``1`` so a full pool still blocks a create. Budget-correct: no returned
    action pushes ``spent`` past the ceiling.
