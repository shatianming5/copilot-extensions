"""CodeSpace-side relay helper assets.

These shell scripts are deployed *into* a CodeSpace by ``agent-codespaces
ssh`` so that ADO authentication works over the SSH credential-relay
tunnel:

- ``ado-auth-helper-relay`` -- the relay client. Proxies git-credential
  ``get`` and ``get-access-token`` requests over the SSH RemoteForward
  tunnel to the host's credential relay (and on to Git Credential
  Manager). Installed to ``~/.local/bin/ado-auth-helper-relay``.

- ``ado-auth-helper-wrapper`` -- a smart **Node** shim installed as
  ``~/ado-auth-helper``. When
  ``LC_GIT_CREDENTIAL_RELAY`` is set (or the tunnel port is reachable) it
  delegates to ``ado-auth-helper-relay``; otherwise it ``require()``s the
  REAL VS Code extension ``auth-helper.js`` (discovered at runtime), mirroring
  the extension's own shim so VS Code auth keeps working after an SSH
  disconnect -- rather than exec'ing a static backup that goes stale on
  extension updates.

The generic git-credential proxy that used to live alongside these is no
longer needed: ``build_provision_command`` pins git's per-host
``credential.<host>.helper`` for the ADO hosts and github.com to the relay-first
``~/ado-auth-helper`` wrapper, so headless ``git push`` resolves credentials
through the relay (the native config points ADO at the VS Code broker -- empty
headless -- and GitHub at a codespace-scoped token, #133/#112/#159).

The host-side relay server lives in the ``credential_relay`` lib (run by
agent-bridge; sources injected by agent-codespaces ``relay_provider``).

# Headless-boot git hardening (#18). On a cold start-from-stopped, the

# credential-relay tunnel exists). A boot step that calls ado-auth-helper for an
# ADO token therefore fails fast and may fall back to a plain-git interactive
# ``Username:`` prompt that HANGS in GitHub's start-waiter path, making every
# cold connect slow. Persisting GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 for all login shells makes
# that fallback fail fast ("terminal prompts disabled") instead; ADO auth then
# converges once the agent connects and the relay comes up.
#
# Scope note: GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 only suppresses git's OWN last-resort
# terminal username/password prompt. It does NOT disable credential helpers --
# the codespace's ado-auth-helper / GitHub helper, the VS Code ado-codespaces
# extension's interactive auth, and Git Credential Manager (where present) are
# all invoked first and keep working. So a later interactive VS Code session
# still authenticates normally; only git's legacy raw terminal prompt (a
# fallback that hangs headless) is turned off. We intentionally do NOT set
# GCM_INTERACTIVE here: that could suppress an interactive GCM prompt in a VS
# Code terminal, and it is unnecessary -- GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT is what fixes the
# hang.
#
# This is deliberately unconditional (all login shells, not headless-only):
# suppressing git's inline prompt is *also* the better behavior in VS Code,
# where that native prompt surfaces as an awkward top-of-window password
# popup. Failing with a 401 and letting the proper credential helper / auth

# Fix, mirroring the reporter's own verified manual workaround: for every

# ``rush.json`` + ``common/scripts/install-run-rush.js``), run the Rush
