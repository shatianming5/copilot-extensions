    (a DIFFERENT account's same-named CodeSpace getting reported/

    account was never actually verified), contradicting the binding's own
    authority (review findings: "Do not scan other accounts after a bound
    lookup returns 404" and "Binding lookup errors incorrectly fall
    through to other accounts"). The scan is the fallback ONLY when there
    is NO binding at all -- a missing binding must not make an otherwise-

    scan's own candidate-list setup, rather than either one degrading to
    "no binding"/an empty candidate set (review findings: "Fail closed
    when account binding cannot be read" and "Propagate binding read
    failures instead of scanning accounts"). Likewise, once ANY candidate
    in the fallback scan has produced an ambiguous error, a LATER
