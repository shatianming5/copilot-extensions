"""Register CodeSpace-scoped plugins into a CodeSpace's user settings (global lane).

The CodeSpace-scoped (a.k.a. "global") plugin lane. A **harness** plugin declares,
via its ``plugin.json`` ``codespacePlugins`` array, the ``<name>-agent`` plugins
that should be active on a CodeSpace it provisions -- see
:mod:`agent_codespaces.codespace_plugins` for the *discovery* half
(:func:`~agent_codespaces.codespace_plugins.resolve_codespace_plugins`).

This module is the **register-into-CodeSpace** half: at connect, agent-codespaces
resolves the applicable specs and writes them into the CodeSpace **user** settings
(``~/.copilot/settings.json``) -- registering each referenced marketplace,
enabling every ``<name>@<marketplace>`` in ``enabledPlugins``, turning on
``experimental``, and defaulting sandbox to disabled for clarity/consistency
when the user has not already set an explicit ``sandbox.enabled`` preference
(an existing ``true`` is preserved, never overridden). Because this is
*user-level* settings (not a repo
``settings.local.json`` and not a session ``--plugin-dir``), it is honored in
**every** launch mode -- interactive VS Code, ``copilot -p``, and the
``copilot --acp`` agent-bridge dispatch alike. That is precisely why the
CodeSpace-scoped lane lives in user settings rather than the ``--plugin-dir``
mechanic the *related-repo* lane uses: a human opening the CodeSpace in VS Code
has no agent-bridge to pass ``--plugin-dir``.

Payloads are also pre-installed (``copilot plugin install``) at connect while the
credential relay is up, so a later launch finds them on disk with no launch-time
marketplace fetch -- dodging the ``LAUNCH_ACP`` egress hang the benchmark effort
tied to egress-restricted startup fetches. The pre-install is best-effort: if it
fails, the user-settings enablement still delivers the plugin on the next
interactive launch (which has full network + interactive auth).

Pure helpers only (command construction) so they are unit-testable; the actual
``exec_command`` lives in :mod:`agent_codespaces.__main__`.
