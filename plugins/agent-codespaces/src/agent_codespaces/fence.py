"""Cross-harness in-CodeSpace lockfile fence (git-ref-resource-leases Phase 4).

The repo-ref L2 store (``coordination.py`` / ``agent-worktrees lease``) is
**same-harness-scoped by construction**: a *different* harness writes leases to a
*different* store repo and cannot collide there. The one seam it cannot cover is
two **different** harnesses contending for one shared CodeSpace. This module
fences that **on the resource itself** -- a marker dropped *inside* the CodeSpace
(``~/.agent-lease``) that names the writing harness (identity = the lease store
origin / control-plane repo), the holder ClaimRef, and a timestamp + TTL.

On connect: read the marker; if one from a **foreign** harness is present and
still **fresh**, the connect is refused (a genuine cross-harness collision the
L2 store cannot see); a **stale** marker, a **same-harness** marker, or an
absent/unreadable one is fine to overwrite with our own.

**Degrade-safe by construction.** This module is pure decision logic + shell
command builders; the caller runs the read/write over SSH and treats any
failure (no harness identity, unreadable marker, exec error) as *proceed* --
the fence only *adds* a cross-harness signal, it never becomes a new hard
dependency. The only blocking outcome is a **successfully read, fresh, foreign**
marker.
