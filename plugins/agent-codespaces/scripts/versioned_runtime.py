"""Immutable per-version runtime layout manager (dotfiles #581).

Never mutate a runtime venv in place. Each version installs into its own immutable
directory under ``<root>/versions/<version>``; the active version is published by a
``<root>/current-version`` **plain-text marker file**. Switching versions writes the
marker (atomic temp + rename) and the installer rewrites its **version-pinned
binstubs** (and scheduled task / deploy manifest) to point straight at
``versions/<version>/...`` -- so a running daemon (which already holds its own
immutable files open) is never edited underneath itself, rollback is a marker
rewrite (no rebuild), and the concurrent-venv-mutation race that spawns duplicate
daemons (#123) cannot happen.

On **Windows there is no directory junction at all**. The legacy ``current``/``venv``
junction (a reparse point) was blocked by Windows RedirectionGuard with WinError 448
("untrusted mount point") on managed devices whenever the installer *traversed* it
over a non-interactive logon; a marker file + pinned binstubs need no reparse point
at all, so those machines work with no special-casing and the legacy real-venv fork
is retired. On **POSIX** the active slot is still published by a plain ``venv``/
``.venv`` **symlink** (not a reparse point, never blocked by RedirectionGuard) that
the ``.sh`` binstub, systemd unit, and deploy-manifest resolve *through* -- the
marker is authoritative and the symlink is the stable runtime-facing path.
``current_version`` still falls back to reading an old link target during the
one-time migration.

This is a **stdlib-only** helper deliberately kept *out* of every runtime venv (no
vendored-lib fan-out): the bootstrapping python at install time runs it as
``python versioned_runtime.py <cmd> ...``. It owns only the ``versions/`` +
``current-version`` layout; venv *creation* and package install stay in the
per-plugin installer, which points them at the slot this returns.

Commands (all take ``--root <dir>``; ``--json`` for machine output)::

    slot     <version>              ensure versions/<version> exists; print its path
    activate <version>              publish current-version -> <version> (marker)
    current                         print the active version (from the marker)
    resolve  [--subpath P]          print versions/<current>/<P> (the concrete slot)
    list                            list installed versions (+ which is current)
    gc [--keep V ...] [--protect-pids] [--min-age-days N]
                                    remove version dirs that are not current,

                                    live process running from the slot, and -- if
                                    a positive N is passed -- not younger than N
                                    days (an optional backstop; default off)
    dev-claim --owner REF [--force]
                                    claim the mutable "dev" slot for REF (a
                                    worktree/session owner ref); refuses if a
                                    different owner already holds a live claim
    dev-release --owner REF [--force]
                                    release REF's claim on the "dev" slot;
                                    prints the version current-version should
                                    be restored to (its value before the claim)
    dev-status                      print the current dev-slot claim (or null)
