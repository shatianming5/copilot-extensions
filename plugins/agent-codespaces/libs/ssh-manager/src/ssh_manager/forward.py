"""LocalForward -- a dedicated ``ssh -N -L <local>:127.0.0.1:<remote>`` process.

Makes a **remote loopback endpoint** (a Session Host running on a machine-mesh
box or inside a CodeSpace) look local, so the agent-bridge frontend always dials
``127.0.0.1:<local_port>`` and speaks the seq/ack protocol -- there is no
per-boundary transport in the ACP hot path (see the ``codespace-dispatch-
reliability`` effort's "one Session Host, two seams, one client").

This is deliberately a **dedicated forwarding process**, not a ControlMaster
``-O forward``:

* On Windows ssh-manager runs in DIRECT mode with **no** persistent master
  process to carry a forward, so an ``-O forward`` has nowhere to live.
* Even on POSIX a dedicated ``ssh -N -L`` process is boundary-uniform and cleanly
  **cancel / re-establish**-able -- which is exactly what the reattach driver's
  ``refresh_endpoint()`` needs after a transport drop.

The near end binds **loopback only** (``127.0.0.1``), so the forwarded endpoint is
never exposed off-box. The forward reuses the same :class:`SSHConfig` the
ConnectionManager uses (including a CodeSpace's ``gh cs ssh`` ``ProxyCommand`` via
its ``-F`` config file), so a CodeSpace forward is just ``ssh -F <cfg> <host>
-N -L ...`` over the gh tunnel.
