"""Reference files for a detached CLI-mode session (``copilot --detach --ref-file``).

An orchestrator hands the *worker* a file it should consult -- a HAR trace, a
session transcript, a log -- without reading it into its own context: it passes
only the host path. The file is copied into the venue outside the product
checkout (so it is never committed) and the worker is told where it is, in its
seed (new session) or in a message (running session).

The transfer is the same egress-free lane plugin staging uses
(agent-codespaces' plugin staging): tar+gzip in memory, base64 over
the SSH exec channel's **stdin**, so the command line stays tiny.
