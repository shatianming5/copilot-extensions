# Codespaces Lifecycle

Day-to-day operations for GitHub Codespaces via agent-codespaces. For
first-time setup and config changes, see the `codespaces-setup` skill.

Use the exact `argv` from the agent-codespaces session command catalog for
CodeSpace operations and the exact `argv` from the agent-worktrees catalog for
worktree claims. For bridge dispatch, use the exact `argv[0]` from the
session command catalog for agent-bridge and replace
`<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]>` below with that path. Never substitute a
same-named plugin command through ambient PATH. The payload-local commands
self-provision on first use. Full detail:
`codespaces-setup` § *Readiness*.

## Connecting to CodeSpaces

Routine **dispatch** should go through **agent-bridge**, not raw SSH.
CodeSpace agents are discovered **automatically** via the agent-codespaces
namespace resolver — **no manual registration is needed past installation**
(see *Agent-Bridge Integration* below). Any CodeSpace (running or stopped) is
addressable as `codespace:<name>`, by either its **raw** name or its **friendly**
(display) name. The `codespace:` prefix is optional — a bare name resolves too,
and constrains nothing; use the prefix to force CodeSpace-only resolution. A
bare name that collides with another agent makes the bridge **balk** and list
the candidates.

```bash
<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send codespace:my-feature-branch "<prompt>"
<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send my-feature-branch "<prompt>"
<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send codespace:my-feature-branch-7qv4rv "..."
```

### Agent-Bridge CLI

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> agents` | List all available agents (local + codespace) |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send codespace:<name> "<prompt>"` | Start a new session (blocks until turn completes) |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send <session-id> "<prompt>"` | Send follow-up prompt on existing session |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send --no-wait <target> "<prompt>"` | Deliberate fire-and-forget — returns a session ID without attaching to its feed |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> wait <session-id>` | Block until current turn completes |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> sessions` | List all sessions with status |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> sessions --status idle` | List sessions ready for follow-up |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> stop <session-id>` | Pause session (preserves state for resume) |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> resume <session-id>` | Resume a stopped session |
| `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> end <session-id>` | End and clean up session |

### Sync pattern (default — recommended for interactive use)

The payload-local `send` operation blocks until the turn completes.
Use when you need the result before continuing.

```
powershell(command: '& "<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]>" send "codespace:<name>" "<prompt>"', initial_wait: 120)
```

### Long-running interactive work

Keep the default attached stream when the operator expects to see progress.
Long runtime alone is **not** a reason to add `--no-wait`: the bridge collapses
thoughts and tools into a low-noise live feed and emits liveness markers during
quiet tool calls.

```
powershell(command: '& "<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]>" send "codespace:<name>" "<prompt>"', initial_wait: 300)
```

If the outer tool runner backgrounds the still-running command after its
initial wait, keep following that same tool session rather than declaring the
dispatch complete.

### Detached pattern (fire-and-forget only)

Use `--no-wait` only when the caller intentionally does not need the result or
live progress. It exits immediately; no background command remains to produce a
completion notification, and the remote feed accumulates unread until a caller
attaches to it.

```
powershell(command: '& "<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]>" send --no-wait "codespace:<name>" "<prompt>"')
# Capture the returned session ID.
powershell(command: '& "<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]>" read <session-id>', initial_wait: 300)
# `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> wait <session-id>` is also valid when only the current turn matters.
```

Do not end the host turn with only "implementation is running" when the result
is part of the current request. Either keep the original `send` attached, or
immediately follow with `read`/`wait`. A genuinely detached dispatch needs an
explicit later monitoring plan.

### Multi-turn sessions

Sessions are persistent. After the first `send` creates a session, send
follow-ups using the session ID:

```bash
<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send "codespace:<name>" "Research the auth module"
# → Session abc123-def (keen-river) created

<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send abc123-def "Now implement the changes"
# → [response]

<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> end abc123-def
```

### Startup and Shutdown Behavior

- **Shutdown CodeSpaces auto-start** when the bridge connects. Startup
  takes 60–120 s; the SSH layer retries automatically (up to ~180 s).
- **Transient dev-tunnel resets are retried** ("An existing connection was
  forcibly closed", `error getting tunnel`, RPC `Unavailable`, ssh exit 255):
  ssh-manager backs off and retries the `gh codespace ssh --config` fetch, the
  connect, and every idempotent remote step (`exec_with_retry`: probes,
  staging, settings merges, installs); a detached launch or `--stop` retries
  its connection once. A failure that survives those retries is real -- read
  its stderr rather than re-running blindly.
- **Do NOT pre-start CodeSpaces with manual SSH** — the bridge handles
  startup end-to-end.
- **Pool pressure:** the catalog command's `create` action consults the pool planner before
  spending another box: it prefers reusing a suitable idle CodeSpace and refuses
  over-budget creates unless `--force-create` is passed. Inspect with
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> pool` or preflight with
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> allocate <repo>`.

### Exclusive control: claim + cross-harness fence

A CodeSpace is fronted by a single bridge, so `agent-codespaces` takes an
**exclusive, worktree-keyed claim** on connect (`ssh --effort` / `claim`): a
host-local **L1** lock plus an atomic cross-machine **L2** Git-ref lease
(`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> lease`, the same-harness authority) — a live claim on another
machine raises `[BUSY]`/`ClaimConflict` (take over with `--force-claim`). On top,
a **cross-harness fence** reads a lockfile inside the CodeSpace (`~/.agent-lease`)
and **refuses** the connect if a *foreign harness* holds it (the seam the
same-harness ref store cannot see). All degrade-safe — a missing store / identity
never blocks. See `borrowing-codespaces` for the full lease + fence model.

## CLI-mode sessions (`copilot`)

`<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> copilot <name>` delivers a real interactive Copilot CLI
session, running in a tmux session inside the CodeSpace, into **this**
terminal (it reserves the CLI-mode slot on the host agent-bridge, forwards the
credential relay and the host bridge port, and runs the venue's agent-worktrees
`copilot` verb there). Re-running it re-attaches to the same session.
`--ttl-seconds` applies only to this attached-mode CLI reservation (default
300 seconds before an unclaimed reservation is reclaimable); do not pass it with
`--detach` or `--stop`.

An **orchestrating agent** uses the detached form instead -- nothing takes over
its terminal:

```bash
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> copilot <name> --detach --seed-file task.md \
  --driver orchestrator --copilot-arg=--no-ask-user     # prints a JSON handle
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> copilot <name> --detach --seed-file task.md \
  --ref-file ./trace.har --ref-file ./session.md        # + reference files for the worker
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> copilot <name> --detach --dry-run   # resolved plan, no side effects
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> copilot <name> --stop               # verified stop, then release
```

Launched with `--effort <owner>`, the attach (`copilot <name>`) and `--stop`
commands must pass the same `--effort`: they connect, and the CodeSpace claim
refuses a different owner as busy. The launch's JSON `commands` already carry it.

`--detach` runs the same dispatch-grade venue preparation as an agent-bridge
dispatch (relay helpers, dotfiles/harness, CodeSpace-scoped plugins staged into
the session via `--plugin-dir`, repo hooks, auth checks), then from the product
checkout adopts it as an anchor-only `agent-worktrees` project if needed,
records that folder in Copilot's `trustedFolders` (nobody is there to answer the
first-run trust dialog), and launches the session with the venue's agent-worktrees
`embody` verb.
A new detached session starts on **the caller's own model**: the launch adds
`--model`, `--reasoning-effort`, and `--context` from the host
`~/.copilot/settings.json` (`model`, `effortLevel`, `contextTier`), the same
resolution the ACP dispatch path uses. `AGENT_CODESPACES_ACP_MODEL` /
`_EFFORT` / `_CONTEXT` override it, `AGENT_CODESPACES_MODEL_PROPAGATE=0` turns
it off, and a flag passed explicitly with `--copilot-arg` always wins.
A resume that names only the session (`--copilot-arg=--resume=<id>`, as a
supervisor's automatic wake after a CodeSpace stop does) keeps the
`--copilot-arg`s (host-propagated model flags included) and `--driver` that
session actually ran with: a launch that starts a session records them, with
the session's id, under
`~/.agent-codespaces/launches/<codespace>/` (its JSON lists what was reused
under `recalled`), and the resume adds no host model defaults the session didn't
run with. Only a resume of that same session id with no other flags
and no `--driver` reuses them -- never a new session, another
session, `--continue`, or a launch with explicit flags -- and a rejoin of an
already running session leaves the record alone.
The record keeps the session's `--forward` ports as well, because the
Connection Owner releases them along with a stopped CodeSpace's session: a
resume of the recorded session id that passes no `--forward` re-adds them
(`recalled` then lists `local_forwards`), whatever its other flags; any
`--forward` given replaces them, and a rejoin that sets them records the new
set. `--reverse-forward`s are never recorded or recalled -- their host end can
move (a restarted host browser listens on a new port), and opening this host to
the venue stays an explicit choice -- so pass them again on every resume.
`--ref-file` (repeatable; a file or a folder, up to 256 MiB per call) copies
reference material into `~/.agent-bridge/refs/<batch>/` on the venue -- outside <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
the product checkout, so it is never committed -- over the same egress-free
stdin lane as plugin staging, and tells the worker the exact paths: in its seed
for a new session, or as a message when the session is already running (so
re-running the same `--detach` command with `--ref-file` hands a running
worker more files). The caller passes only paths; it never reads the files.
`--reverse-forward VENUE_PORT:HOST_PORT` (repeatable) asks the Connection Owner
to keep the CodeSpace's `127.0.0.1:VENUE_PORT` forwarded to this host's
`127.0.0.1:HOST_PORT` for as long as the session lives -- for example a host
browser started with `--remote-debugging-port=<HOST_PORT>` exposed as the
venue's DevTools endpoint on 9222. It binds loopback only on the venue, but
anything running there can then drive that host process: forward only what the
worker should control. A rejoin without the flag keeps the session's forwards.
The launch reports `reverse_forwards_ready` per venue port (it checks each one
accepts a connection); `false` usually means a Connection Owner that predates
this option is still running -- it exits once it holds nothing.
`--forward PORT[:VENUE_PORT]` (repeatable) is the other direction: the Owner
keeps this host's `127.0.0.1:PORT` forwarded to the CodeSpace's
`127.0.0.1:VENUE_PORT` (default: the same port) for the session's life -- for
example the worker's dev server at a fixed `--port`, so a browser on this host
loads `https://localhost:PORT`. A fixed host port is the default and documented
contract: it keeps TLS certs, redirect URIs, cookies, and worker-facing URLs
tied to the expected `https://localhost:PORT`; use `--forward N:VENUE_PORT`
when the host port must remain pinned to exactly `N`. Use `--forward 0:VENUE_PORT`
only when the caller explicitly wants the Owner to bind a system-assigned host
port; `VENUE_PORT` is required, and the launch JSON reports the actual assigned
host port in `local_forwards` and `local_forwards_ready`. Once assigned, that
host port is kept for the session's life across reconnects, rejoins, and Owner
restarts while the Owner can still bind it. If something else grabs that
kernel-assigned port while the forward is down, the Owner records a replacement
assigned port rather than reporting another process's listener as ready; the URL
changes only because the old assigned port is unusable. Re-running the same
`--forward 0:VENUE_PORT` for a running session reuses the assigned host port the
hold recorded, even after an Owner restart (the active-forward beacon may be
missing or stale then): the restarted Owner rebinds that port and assigns a new
one only on a proven conflict. The forward can exist
before the server starts. A rejoin without the flag keeps the
session's existing assigned or fixed port; `--stop` removes it. If the launch
times out before the Owner reports the assigned port, the session still returns
`ok: true` with `session_id`, `commands`, `local_forwards_pending: {"0":
VENUE_PORT}`, and an `error` note; a pre-upgrade Owner that sanitizes away the
pending `0` key is the usual cause. `false` in `local_forwards_ready` usually
means the host port is taken or a pre-`--forward` Owner is still running.
A multi-line or long seed is written to `~/.agent-bridge/seeds/` on the venue and <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
seeded as a one-line pointer (tmux-typed input must be a single line). It
succeeds once the session is registered with the host bridge. If the launch
created a session but Copilot did not reach a confirmed input prompt in time,
the command keeps the live session and delivers the seed over the existing
host bridge's message lane; the JSON reports `seed_delivery: "bridge"` (or
`"failed"` if that follow-up message could not be sent). A seed that may have
reached Copilot's input without being submitted (typed but Enter failed, or a
keystroke send that failed part-way) is never resent, since its draft may still
be there: the session is kept and `seed_delivery` is `"failed"`.
Only a created session
that never registers is treated as unrepresented: the failure reports the screen
(`pane_tail`) and stops what it started. `--register-timeout` covers the host
bridge claim wait; the venue-side prompt wait can slide while Copilot is visibly
busy, up to its own hard cap, and the launch transport timeout remains longer
than that cap.
The **Connection Owner** keeps the
credential relay and the host-bridge forward alive while its mux session exists
(checked from the host every couple of minutes, only after the
launch confirmed the session; never by waking a stopped CodeSpace), up to a 24h
cap, and both forwards follow a host bridge restart onto its new port. When a held
CodeSpace stops (an idle timeout or GitHub's runtime limit), the Owner tears its
forwards down and does not rebuild them until the CodeSpace is `Available` again
(a rebuild would boot it back up). A rejoin (`copilot <name> --detach
--copilot-arg=--resume=<id>`) starts it, and the Owner restores its forwards
within one cycle. Its `gh` calls run off the loop that carries every forward, so
one slow or stopped CodeSpace never stalls another CodeSpace's relay or bridge. On the same
check it mirrors the running session's transcript to this host (whole lines, only
what was appended) and pushes it into the agent-logger hub under
`.codespaces-live/<name>` (its own namespace: the close-out capture below uses
`.codespaces/<name>`), so the session's history is still readable here after a host
or bridge restart. A push that fails, or lands only partly, is retried until
it lands whole, across Owner restarts and even after the session ends or the
box stops (it never contacts the box for that); an Owner with nothing else to
hold stays up to an hour to retry it, and the next Owner start resumes it after
that. `delete` removes a CodeSpace's local mirror once its hub copy is current,
then or on a later retry (`AGENT_CODESPACES_TRANSCRIPT_MIRROR=0` turns this off).
The Owner usually runs headless, so it logs to
`~/.agent-codespaces/logs/owner.log` (rotated when an Owner starts; under
`AGENT_CODESPACES_HOME` when set): its start and stop, every relay or forward
re-establish, and every failed cycle. Read it first when a worker's credential
relay or a forward drops. Observe and steer it through agent-bridge
(`live-sessions resolve`, `result`, `send`, `ui`). A detached launch keeps the
CodeSpace claim active; `--stop` settles it like any finished connection and
deregisters the stopped session from the host bridge at once. When close-out
continues on the box (for example `finalize` to recover its session state),
pass `--stop --keep-claim`: the session is stopped and deregistered the same
way, but a clean checkout does not settle the claim at-rest (which releases it
to the next borrower), so no other task can take the box mid-recovery; release
the claim last. A CodeSpace that
is already `Shutdown` is never booted for `--stop`: its session is gone, so it
only releases and deregisters (`already_shutdown`), and the claim is settled by
the ordinary release/retire step.

Requires the venue's `agent-worktrees` and `agent-bridge` plugins to support
`embody --bridge-scope-id/--copilot-arg`; an older venue fails closed with an
"update agent-worktrees on the CodeSpace" error. The launch's own preflight
installs `agent-bridge` on the venue when it is missing and updates it when it
is older than the host bridge's version (an old venue CLI can start a local
daemon over the forwarded host route); `doctor <name> --fix` does the same and
reports a plugin that is still behind as a gap.

## SSH (Diagnostic Only)

SSH is for diagnostics and one-off commands, **not routine dispatch**.
If you find yourself using SSH for dispatch or status checks, diagnose
the bridge connection instead.

> **Never SSH a CodeSpace that has an active dispatch.** The catalog command's `ssh` action
> shares the same ssh-manager ControlMaster socket as the dispatch's connection;
> a concurrent diagnostic SSH can tear that down and **collapse the running
> session**. To answer "is it making progress?", read the bridge feed and get
> durable state (branch HEAD / pushed / PR) from the **source of truth** (the git
> remote / PR API) — not by shelling into the CodeSpace. Reserve host SSH for a
> CodeSpace whose dispatch is **stopped/idle**.

> **CodeSpace dispatch sessions are now resilient to the failures that used to
> collapse them ~every 10–15 min.** The main culprit — the ACP stdio relay
> giving up after 30 s of a quiet (output-buffered) remote tool call — is fixed,
> and a bridge **daemon restart is survived** (a streaming `send`/`read`/`wait`
> reconnects from its delivery cursor, and the next `send` auto-resumes the
> session). Genuine drops are now rare but still possible (a CodeSpace idle
> timeout, a network partition). Long jobs should still be **idempotent** and
> **push early and often**, and you can **resume on drop**
> (`<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> end <sid>` →
> `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> create …`).
> See the agent-bridge
> skill's *Dispatching Long Autonomous Work* flow.

> **Always use the agent-codespaces catalog command's `ssh` action**, not bare
> `gh codespace ssh`.
> Raw `gh codespace ssh` bypasses ssh-manager and can conflict with
> managed connections — duplicate ControlMaster sockets, missed
> credential relay tunnels, and orphan SSH processes.

```bash
# Interactive SSH session (with credential relay tunnel)
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <codespace-name>

# Run a command and return output
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <codespace-name> --remote-cmd "ls -la"

# Structured stdio for agent-bridge transport
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <codespace-name> --stdio --remote-cmd "copilot --acp --stdio"

# Skip credential relay tunnel setup
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <codespace-name> --no-relay
```

## Listing and Status

```bash
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> list
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> list --json
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> pool
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> pool --json
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> allocate <owner/repo> --json
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> status
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> doctor
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> version
```

## Creating and Deleting

```bash
# Create a CodeSpace on a repo + run on_create provisioning from config
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> create <owner/repo>
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> create <owner/repo> --branch <branch> --display-name <name>
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> create <owner/repo> --devcontainer-path .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> create <owner/repo> --force-create
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> create <owner/repo> --no-wait

<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> delete <codespace-name>
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> delete <codespace-name> --no-sync

# Remove stale local state (orphaned SSH configs, ControlMaster sockets)
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> cleanup
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> cleanup --dry-run
```

CodeSpace creation uses `gh codespace create` with defaults by convention
(`largePremiumLinux`/`EastUs`); per-repo overrides from
`.copilot-extensions/agent-codespaces/config.yaml` (machine type, location) apply automatically
based on the target repository.

## Finalize — graceful close-out with session recovery

Before a CodeSpace is destroyed, its Copilot session history (`~/.copilot`
session-state) should be recovered — a deleted CodeSpace's transcripts are
gone forever. `finalize` pulls the session-state off the CodeSpace and lands
it in the agent-logger storage hub (under `.codespaces/<name>/`), reusing
agent-logger's `session-sync push` management entry point. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow logger-management -->
Only the `session-state` tree and the
`session-store.db` index are pulled — never credentials, keys, or settings.

```bash
# Recover sessions, stop the CodeSpace, and mark it recovered/reusable
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> finalize <codespace-name>

# Recover sessions, require a fresh off-box-safety verdict, then delete
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> verify <codespace-name>
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> finalize <codespace-name> --delete
```

Plain `finalize` is the preserve path: it recovers Copilot session-state, stops
the CodeSpace (idempotent if already `Shutdown`), marks it `recovered`, and
releases the borrow so the box can be reused later. It does **not** delete.

`finalize --delete` is the destructive path. It first checks the no-SSH
`codespace-clean` beacon; if safety is unknown, run
`<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> verify <name>` to SSH-probe git cleanliness
and publish a fresh verdict, then retry.
It also refuses deletion after failed session recovery unless `--force` is
explicitly supplied.

> 🛑 **If `finalize --delete` refuses, diagnose — don't bypass.** Common causes:
> unknown/dirty off-box safety (`verify` or push/settle the work), a
> still-booting CodeSpace, or an SSH/relay hiccup. For a genuinely unrecoverable
> CodeSpace, deletion is break-glass:
> `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> finalize <name> --delete --force` or
> `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> delete <name> --force --no-sync`.

`delete` also runs recovery automatically as a **best-effort pre-delete hook**
(skip with `--no-sync`); unlike `finalize --delete`, it does not gate on
recovery or the cleanliness beacon. Prefer `finalize --delete` for normal
retirement, and reserve `delete` for deliberate break-glass cleanup.

> **Closing out a CodeSpace settles the borrowing worktree's obligation.** A

## Stop — pause-and-keep (preserve, don't delete)

When an effort is **paused but not done** (e.g. waiting on an external gate — a
feed publish, a redeploy, a review), release the compute but **keep** the
CodeSpace so it resumes later. `stop` is the pause-and-keep counterpart to
`finalize --delete`: it recovers session-state (same hook as `finalize`) and
then shuts the CodeSpace down gracefully via `gh codespace stop`. It **never
deletes**, and a stopped CodeSpace **boots again on the next connect** (no
explicit start needed).

```bash
# Recover sessions, then gracefully stop (preserve for later resume)
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> stop <codespace-name>
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> stop <codespace-name> --no-sync
```

Unlike `finalize --delete`, a failed pre-stop recovery does **not** block the
stop — stopping is non-destructive, so the sessions stay on the preserved
CodeSpace and can be recovered on a later connect. `stop` is **idempotent**: a
no-op if the CodeSpace is already `Shutdown`.

Never use a bare `gh codespace stop` — it bypasses the session-recovery hook.

## Syncing Dotfiles on CodeSpaces

Use the catalog command's `ssh` action to pull latest:
```bash
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --remote-cmd "cd /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles && git pull origin main && bash install.sh"
```

If credential relay isn't active, pass the token via `--remote-cmd`:
```bash
token=$(gh auth token)
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --no-relay --remote-cmd "cd /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles && git pull https://x-access-token:${token}@github.com/<user>/dotfiles.git main"
```

### Fresh clone (when .git is missing or corrupted)

```bash
token=$(gh auth token)
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --no-relay --remote-cmd "rm -rf /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles && git clone https://x-access-token:${token}@github.com/<user>/dotfiles.git /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles"
<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --no-relay --remote-cmd "bash /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles/install.sh"
```

> **Do NOT use `tar` or `git archive` pipes** to sync dotfiles. They
> destroy `.git` state, introduce CRLF from Windows, and leave stale
> files from renames/deletes. Always maintain a proper git clone.
>
> **Always use the agent-codespaces catalog command's `ssh` action**, not bare
> `gh codespace ssh`.
> The latter bypasses ssh-manager and can conflict with managed
> connections (ControlMaster sockets, credential relay tunnels).

## Credential Relay

The credential relay is a host-side TCP server owned by the agent-bridge daemon.
Its port is dynamic by default (`credentials.relay_port: 0`): the daemon
publishes the live port, and agent-codespaces follows that when creating the SSH
reverse-forward. A positive `credentials.relay_port` pins a fixed port; `9857`
is only a last-resort compatibility fallback when no live/pinned port is known.
It proxies credential requests to local credential stores.

### How It Works

1. agent-bridge runs the relay server on `127.0.0.1:<live-port>`
2. The catalog command's `ssh` action includes an SSH reverse-forward for that live port
3. CodeSpace sends git-credential-protocol requests to `localhost:<live-port>`
4. Relay routes to matching source (GCM / `git-credential`, plus `gh-auth`
   only for explicit `get-github-token`, plus `az-login` for allowed Azure
   resources)
5. Response flows back through the tunnel

### Available Sources

| Source | Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `git-credential` | `get`/`store`/`erase` | Proxies to local Git Credential Manager |
| `gh-auth` | `get-github-token` | Returns the active `gh auth token` for explicit token requests only; it is not used for git credential `get`/`fill` |
| `az-login` | `get-azure-token` | Returns Azure access tokens for the built-in ADO/Storage resources plus configured `allowed_resources` |

### Policy Enforcement

All requests pass through a policy gate before reaching any source:
- **Action allowlist** -- only recognized actions are accepted
- **Host allowlist** -- fnmatch-style patterns per source
- **Resource allowlist** -- exact-match for Azure resources (az-login)

GitHub order is per connection: inject the bound CodeSpace account, or the
active `gh` account for ambient-owned CodeSpaces, as `username=<account>` for
`github.com`; then call non-interactive GCM. The relay profile is account-free.
Missing or ambiguous GitHub credentials are warnings for connect/detach (ADO-only
or interactive work can still proceed) but remain doctor findings. The relay
does not substitute `gh auth token` for git credential `get`/`fill`.

## Agent-Bridge Integration

**No manual registration is required.** When agent-codespaces is installed, its
sessionStart hook drops a small **namespace-provider manifest** into
`~/.agent-bridge/providers.d/` (declaring the `codespace:` namespace and the <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
absolute path to the agent-codespaces binstub). agent-bridge discovers that
manifest there and registers the `codespace:` **namespace resolver**, driving
the provider over a process boundary. That resolver lists and resolves your
CodeSpaces **live** (via `gh codespace list`) on demand — so
the payload-local `agents` output shows them and
`<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> send codespace:<name>` works immediately,
with no expiry, including newly-created CodeSpaces.

Because discovery is declarative (a dropped manifest carrying an absolute
command), it works even though the agent-bridge daemon runs from its own
isolated venv and does not need agent-codespaces importable or on `PATH`. There
is **no imperative `bridge register` step** — installing the plugin is all
that's needed.

The bridge-facing relay/session-host paths are likewise CLI-seam first:
The bridge calls the registered **management entry point** with
`relay-profile`, `relay-launch-env`, and `provision-command` when it needs the
CodeSpace relay policy or launch prelude. Session command catalogs do not
replace this provider/supervisor boundary; moving that launcher requires
installation-context ownership in a later phase.
In-process imports remain only as degrade-safe fallbacks when the bridge venv
happens to vendor the package; the agent-codespaces CLI/runtime is still owned
by agent-codespaces.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH hangs** -- test with
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --remote-cmd "echo ok" --no-relay`.
  If that works, check credential relay. If it doesn't, verify
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> doctor` / `gh auth status` is authenticated.
- **Bridge connection fails** -- the bridge auto-starts Shutdown
  CodeSpaces and retries SSH (up to ~180 s). If it still fails, try
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> ssh <name> --remote-cmd "echo ok" --no-relay`.
  Check `<agent-bridge catalog argv[0]> status` and
  `~/.agent-bridge/agent-bridge-err.log`. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
- **No `codespace:` targets** -- provider registration still uses the explicit
  management binstub, not the session catalog. If that binstub is missing,
  stamp it from the same explicitly selected payload shown in
  `codespaces-setup` § *Readiness*, then start a new session so the provider
  manifest is registered.
- **Session fails on start** -- check `~/.agent-bridge/agent-bridge-err.log`. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
  Common cause: wrong `ssh_user` in
  `.copilot-extensions/agent-codespaces/config.yaml`.
- **Credential relay not working** -- check that `--no-relay` was not
  accidentally passed, then confirm agent-bridge's relay is up
  (`agent-bridge service restart` repairs the owner daemon). <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow service-management -->
  The client warns when the
  host relay is not listening before connect.
- **Quota exceeded** -- creating or connecting to a CodeSpace (a Shutdown one
  boots on connect) returns HTTP 400 "too many codespaces running" once the
  concurrently-running cap is hit.
  `<agent-codespaces catalog argv[0]> stop <name>` idle
  CodeSpaces first (preserves them), then retry.
- **"gh CLI not found"** -- install from https://cli.github.com/
- **WSL credential slowness** -- first GCM call through PowerShell
  takes ~25s. Subsequent calls use the 300s cache.
- **PowerShell swallows `$` before it ever reaches the remote shell** -- a
  double-quoted `--remote-cmd` string is expanded by **PowerShell itself**
  first: `"...$?..."` and `"...$LC_GIT_CREDENTIAL_RELAY..."` become PowerShell's
  own `$?`/an undefined variable (often silently empty) *before* SSH ever sees
  them, not the remote bash values. Symptoms: an unexpected literal
  `True`/`False`, or a variable that reads as empty when the remote-side value
  is known to be set. Fix: single-quote the whole `--remote-cmd` value (or
  backtick-escape every `$` you want the remote shell to see), e.g.
  `--remote-cmd 'echo scope=$LC_GIT_CREDENTIAL_RELAY'`.
- **A `--remote-cmd` that touches the credential relay or mints a token times
  out at the 60 s default** -- `stage 4/target-auth-env` (credential-relay
  warm-up) alone commonly takes 20-40 s, and a live `az`/relay token mint can
  take significantly longer under host load (tens of seconds is normal, not a
  hang). Pass explicit, generous budgets for any relay- or `az`-touching
  command, e.g. `--timeout 90 --connect-timeout 220`, rather than assuming the
  default 60 s is enough and treating an early cutoff as a real failure.
- **A `get-azure-token` relay request for an Azure resource/scope not in the
  CodeSpace's allowlist is denied explicitly** -- the response carries
  `error=access_denied` / `reason=resource_not_allowed` (fixed in
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#4367`; before that fix the request came
  back as a fully empty response with no diagnostic). `ado-auth-helper-relay`
  surfaces this on stderr as "the credential relay confirmed this resource is
  not in the host's Azure allowlist". If you hit this, check what that
  CodeSpace is actually allowed to mint: the host's
  `~/.agent-codespaces/relay-tokens.json` has a per-CodeSpace
  `allowed_resources` list (commonly just the ADO resource GUID
  `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798` and `https://storage.azure.com/`
  unless the target repo's own `.copilot-extensions/agent-codespaces/config.yaml`
  grants more) -- test against one of those first.
