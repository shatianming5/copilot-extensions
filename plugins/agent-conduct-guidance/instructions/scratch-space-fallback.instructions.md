# Scratch-space hygiene fallback

**Fallback policy `[owner: agent-conduct-guidance@0.1.5-dev1]`:** Any ad hoc
working file an agent creates outside a repository checkout -- a downloaded
artifact, an intermediate log, a draft PR/issue body, a one-off JSON/text
dump, a captured command's output -- must never be written as a loose file
directly at a filesystem/drive root or any other shared, un-timestamped
location, and never into a session-managed state folder (no repository
checkouts, builds, or PII/secrets there either). A bare root with no
per-task structure gives nobody (human or a later agent) any signal for
whether a given file is still in use or long since expired, and it
accumulates indefinitely. This does not apply to an artifact a
session-management framework already owns and places itself (e.g. a
context-handoff brief kept in its own framework-managed location) -- leave
that where its owning framework puts it rather than redirecting it here.
For everything else, resolve a scratch root -- an explicit override, an
operator-configured default, or otherwise the operating system's own
preferred temporary-folder system (see the paired skill for the exact,
portable resolution order -- never hardcode one) -- and create one
freshly-timestamped subfolder per task there before writing anything;
never add loose files beside siblings from unrelated tasks. Clean up that
subfolder once its content is no longer needed, and file anything meant to
last (a plan, a decision, a finding) through the operator's normal durable
channels instead of leaving it in scratch. Invoke the
`using-scratch-space` skill before creating such a file outside a
repository.
