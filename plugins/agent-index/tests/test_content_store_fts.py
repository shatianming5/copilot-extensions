"""FTS rebuild must rely on LanceDB's incremental ``optimize()`` update for an
already-available index, and only pay for a full ``create_fts_index(...,
replace=True)`` on the first build, a recovery from an index that was never
successfully created, or an escalation from a non-retryable incremental
failure (#2951).

Per LanceDB's own docs (Reindexing / Incremental Reindexing), ``optimize()``
already performs compaction, retention pruning, AND an incremental update of
any existing vector/scalar/FTS index against newly-ingested rows. Forcing
``replace=True`` on every dirty-triggered rebuild discarded and rebuilt the
whole BM25 index over the entire content table regardless of how small the
actual delta was -- observed downstream as a sustained heavy read burst off
a handful of new commits.
