"""agent-index Engine Shim -- always-on activator for the ephemeral GPU worker.

Keeps the engine *container* always up while the heavy torch *worker* process
inside it starts on demand and stops on idle. The shim holds the public port,
supervises the worker subprocess (``python -m agent_index_engine.app`` on an internal loopback
port), reverse-proxies embed traffic to it, and answers liveness locally so the
container stays healthy while the model is cold.

This is the in-container reimplementation of systemd socket activation: the
container is a vanilla always-on service (any orchestrator runs it with no
bring-up logic), while VRAM + the ~1 GB torch process baseline are reclaimed
whenever the worker idles out. See effort service-containerization (#601) and
issue #1662 -- agent-index is the reference implementation of this reusable pattern.

Division of responsibility (single idle authority): the SHIM owns lifecycle. It
launches the worker with ``AGENT_INDEX_ENGINE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0`` so the worker never
self-exits; the shim's own idle monitor stops the worker. Stopping the worker (SIGTERM) cleanly frees VRAM.

Activity semantics mirror the worker: ``/embed``, ``/embed/batch``, ``/spinup``
(and any other proxied path) count as activity and wake the worker; ``/health``
and ``/ready`` deliberately do NOT, so liveness polling can't pin the worker
awake. ``/spindown`` stops the worker outright (full reclaim) rather than only
unloading the model.
