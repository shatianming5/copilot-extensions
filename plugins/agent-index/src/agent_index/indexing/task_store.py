        Deduplication: if an identical task is already queued (not
        processing), returns that task instead of creating a duplicate.
        Uses BEGIN IMMEDIATE to prevent concurrent duplicate inserts.

        Full-vs-incremental sequencing (a full reindex renders any
        *covered* incremental redundant -- it never competes with one):

        - Enqueuing a ``full=True`` task cancels every currently-``queued``
          ``full=False`` task it covers: ``source='all'`` covers every
          source, a specific source covers only its own exact match.
          Left alone, those incrementals would just redo work this full
          run is about to redo anyway. This is belt-and-suspenders with
          ``dequeue_next``'s full-first priority ordering, which already
          keeps a *still-queued* full task from running after an
          incremental queued earlier for the same scope.
        - Enqueuing a ``full=False`` task that's already covered by an
          existing **queued** (not yet started) ``full=True`` task (exact
          source match, or a covering ``source='all'`` full) is itself
          redundant -- this returns that covering full task instead of
          inserting a new row, so incremental requests never pile up
          uselessly behind a full reindex that hasn't started yet. A
          *processing* full task does NOT count as covering: a full-``all``
          run crawls sources sequentially, so by the time a fresh
          incremental request arrives the processing task may have already
          crawled this source -- coalescing into it would silently drop any
          change that lands afterward, since nothing would be left queued to
          pick it up. Let the incremental enqueue normally in that case; the
          full-first priority in ``dequeue_next`` still won't delay it behind
          any *other* queued full.

        ``trigger_source`` records what initiated this task (e.g.
        'api:agent_index_reindex', 'webhook:forge:push', 'cli', 'mcp').
