"""Index engine - orchestrates scanning, chunking, embedding, and storage.

Four-phase pipeline:
1. **Crawl** - discover files, diff against stored state → CrawlManifest
2. **Embed/Store** - chunk files, embed via GPU, upsert to LanceDB
3. **Reconcile** - delete removed files and stale modified-file chunks
4. **Commit** - update IndexState with new commit marker

Deletions are always deferred to Phase 3 (after successful upserts) for
crash safety.  Every reindex - full or incremental - handles deletions.

Supports multi-model indexing: when multiple model profiles are configured,
each batch is embedded by all available engines and stored in per-model
vector tables alongside the shared content store.
