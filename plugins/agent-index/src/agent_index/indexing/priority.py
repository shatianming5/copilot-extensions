"""Host-resource good citizenship for the background indexer.

The index worker runs as a **dedicated short-lived subprocess** (``agent-index
index-worker``), so it may lower its OWN scheduling priority without touching the
retrieval service that serves queries. This keeps background/webhook-driven
reindexing from driving the host to critical CPU load: the work yields to
foreground/interactive processes under contention while still running at full
speed on an idle box (``nice`` only bites when something else wants the core).

Applied ONCE at worker startup, before any indexing threads or the out-of-process
FTS/embedding children are created, so the lowered priority is inherited by the
whole indexing workload (child threads inherit the creating thread's niceness;
child processes inherit the parent's).

Every step is best-effort and platform-guarded: an unsupported platform (or a
sandbox that forbids priority changes) simply runs at normal priority rather than
failing the indexing job.
