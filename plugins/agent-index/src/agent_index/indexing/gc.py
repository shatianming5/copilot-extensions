"""Source garbage collection -- purge stale source generations (#879).

Over the life of the index, the crawler's source-naming scheme has changed
several times (the old local ``monorepo`` crawler; pre-Phase-7
``forge:owner/repo``; the bare generic ``forge:code`` / ``forge:issues`` /
``forge:pulls`` / ``forge:commits``; the ``forge:owner/repo:issues``
variant). Incremental reconcile only ever prunes *within* a source name the
crawler still emits, so when a naming scheme is abandoned its chunks are
orphaned forever -- they inflate the index and compete in ranking.

This module deletes every chunk whose ``source`` is not part of the current
("live") naming scheme, by exact source value, then leaves compaction to the
caller. It is safe to run on every full reindex: it keys off the *naming
pattern*, not off whether a source produced rows this run, so a live
per-repo source that happens to be empty right now is never purged.

Live source values (current scheme) -- a source is live iff a currently
**registered connector** owns its scheme (``agent_index.sources``):
  - ``git:{repo}`` and ``git:{repo}:commits`` (GitRepoConnector)
  - ``github:{owner}/{repo}`` and its ``:issues`` / ``:pulls`` (GitHubConnector)
  - ``ado:*`` / ``azure-devops:*`` (AzureDevOpsConnector)
  - the bare crawl-marker name of any connector (e.g. ``git``)
  - ``service-feed:clips``, ``analysis-feed:videos``
  - the legacy repo-qualified ``forge:{code|issues|pulls|commits}:{owner}/{repo}``
    (VEI-era generations kept live for back-compat)
  - any exact name in ``$AGENT_INDEX_GC_KEEP_SOURCES`` (comma-separated) -- an
    escape hatch for reviving remote-ingest sources (e.g. a push daemon
    pushing ``host:worktree``) without code changes.

Deriving the live set from the connector registry (rather than a hardcoded
scheme list) is the fix for #116: the extracted engine's GC previously knew
only VEI's ``forge:*`` and purged the generic ``git:*`` index on every full
reindex.
