# agent-index

`agent-index` is a runtime plugin that builds and serves a local semantic +
lexical index for a repo and its configured corpus. The shipped plugin is no
longer just a service shell: it includes the service, CLI, indexing pipeline,
source connectors, LanceDB-backed stores, a warm embedding-engine split, query
surfaces, and a read-only retrieval surface that every agent calls directly
through the `agent-index` CLI.

## What ships today

- **Runtime service**: FastAPI service on loopback with an OS-assigned port,
published through `~/.agent-index/active.json` (zdd routing) and the legacy
`~/.agent-index/run/endpoint.json` rendezvous file.
- **Durable data**: index state, LanceDB tables, task queue, clusters, and worker
logs live under `~/.agent-index/data/`, outside the versioned service runtime.
- **Indexing pipeline**: incremental-by-default crawl/chunk/embed/store/reconcile
for local git files + commits, GitHub issues/PRs, and Azure DevOps work
items/PRs. `--full` is explicit.
- **Search surfaces**: the `agent-index` **CLI** (the primary, agent-facing
surface — every agent calls it directly) and HTTP. The optional `agent-index mcp`
stdio adapter requires the host dependency profile and reports unavailable in
the base-only client runtime without installing anything. agent-index is a uniform retrieval capability every agent may use, so it
is deliberately **not** wrapped in a sub-agent or an MCP tool; agents learn how
to search from the sessionStart scope-binding hook's `additionalContext`.
- **Engine split**: the light service runtime is torch-free by default; embedding
runs through a durable engine daemon at `127.0.0.1:8421` unless an operator opts
into another engine mode.
- **Safe activation**: session-start contributes the command catalog and scope
binding only when one effective repository configuration is active. The session
hook never stamps a runtime, installs packages, or starts a service.
- **Self-supervised host lifecycle**: the light host runtime is installed into
its own versioned slot, and the plugin's installer/runtime commands supervise
it directly. `install`/`update` rebuild only the light `[store,server]` service
slot, then cut traffic over with zdd; the durable engine remains on its separate
explicit lifecycle and is never rebuilt by a routine service update.

## Minimal setup

1. Enable the plugin from the `copilot-extensions` marketplace.
2. Opt the repository in by authoring the checked-in
   `.agent-index/config.yaml` defaults. A repo-local
   `.copilot-extensions/agent-index/config.yaml` overlay may add private
   sources or an indexer designation, and an explicit marketplace-specific
   override may live at
   `.copilot-extensions/agent-index/marketplaces/<marketplace-id>/config.yaml`.
   A config must contain an `indexer`/`indexers` designation or at least one
   `corpus.sources` entry. A malformed, unsafe, ambiguous, or empty config is
   inactive.
3. Start a new Copilot session. The command catalog and scope guidance appear
only for an active config. Session start remains non-mutating: it performs no
runtime provisioning or service startup itself.
4. Pick a role explicitly:
   - single-machine/local indexer: `agent-index setup --single`
   - remote indexer: run `agent-index setup --indexer <machine> --ssh <alias>`
     from the repo; clients route read commands to that host over SSH.
   In automation, add `--yes`; omitting both `--single` and `--indexer` is an
   error rather than silently choosing a role.
5. Setup may provision the lightweight base/client CLI and writes the selected
role. It never provisions the durable embedding engine. Lightweight
provisioning emits `::agent-provisioning::`.

A machine whose resolved role is `client` runs no local indexer daemon. A host
runs its local service through the plugin's own installer/runtime lifecycle.
`install`, `update`, and `provision` manage the light host runtime directly and
use zdd cutover when replacing a live service. The independent durable engine's
explicit lifecycle remains separate and is never coupled to routine host
cutover.

The installer exposes explicit installation-context actions for disposable
installation-cell validation:

```powershell
scripts\install.ps1 -Action slot-provision -Context C:\path\to\install.json -ExpectedMarketplaceId <marketplace-id>
scripts\install.ps1 -Action slot-validate -Context C:\path\to\install.json -ExpectedMarketplaceId <marketplace-id>
scripts\install.ps1 -Action cell-provision -Context C:\path\to\install.json -ExpectedMarketplaceId <marketplace-id>
scripts\install.ps1 -Action cell-recover -Context C:\path\to\install.json -ExpectedMarketplaceId <marketplace-id>
```

```bash
scripts/install.sh slot-provision --context /path/to/install.json --expected-marketplace-id <marketplace-id>
scripts/install.sh slot-validate --context /path/to/install.json --expected-marketplace-id <marketplace-id>
scripts/install.sh cell-provision --context /path/to/install.json --expected-marketplace-id <marketplace-id>
scripts/install.sh cell-recover --context /path/to/install.json --expected-marketplace-id <marketplace-id>
```

The slot actions remain non-activating ownership/validation primitives.
`cell-provision` requires an already-active, validated installation cell.
Client marker CAS, strict completion/profile receipts, source provenance, and
schema-4 manifest transactions remain enforced. Namespaced installations use
the same local slot/cutover primitives as legacy mode; the durable engine still
stays outside those runtime cells.

Missing, requested-only, foreign, malformed, maintained, orphaned, or stale
contexts fail closed without legacy fallback. Deactivation-pending cells retain
their existing-runtime read and ownership-checked stop paths, but cannot
provision or reactivate. Namespaced state/routing/log/cache roots remain
installation-local; engine `start`/`run` remains blocked there. Session hook
compatibility entry points are inert in both installation modes, including
when invoked directly. Absent/default/explicit-false installation policy keeps
the legacy client layout, not legacy host provisioning authority.

## Usage

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Search by meaning within indexed scopes | `agent-index search "<query>" [--source S] [--limit N] --json` |
| Pivot from one result | `agent-index similar <chunk_id> [--source S] [--limit N]` |
| Find near-duplicate clusters | `agent-index clusters [--source S] [--exact-dupes-only]` |
| Check coverage/health | `agent-index status` |
| Refresh the index | `agent-index index [--source S] [--full]` or `POST /reindex` |
| Inspect host/runtime | `agent-index status`; installer/runtime verbs own provisioning, start, cutover, rollback, and retention |
| Install a client | Explicit setup or installer `install`/`update`; namespaced client governance via `cell-provision`, `slot-cutover`, `cell-recover` |
| Manage the engine daemon | `agent-index engine status|start|stop|run`; `install.ps1|sh engine-update` rebuilds the durable engine runtime |
| Adopt host/client routing | `agent-index setup`, `role`, `capability --json` |

The `agent-index` read subcommands (`search`, `similar`, `clusters`, `status`)
are the read-only, agent-facing surface. The optional lower-level `agent-index mcp` server
and the CLI also have an `index` path (`agent_index_reindex` over MCP), but
reindexing is an operator/runtime action, not something agents trigger.

## Corpus configuration

The runtime belongs to this plugin; scope is data/config:

- With no corpus config, `agent-index index` indexes the current git checkout
(`git`) and its commit history.
- `AGENT_INDEX_SOURCES` overrides the default with a comma-separated source list.
- For multi-repo harness-style use, each repo may carry checked-in
  `.agent-index/config.yaml` defaults, optionally supplemented by a repo-local
  `.copilot-extensions/agent-index/config.yaml` overlay; the runtime grafts
  sources from locally adopted projects plus any machine-local supplement in
  `~/.agent-index/config.yaml`.
- Resolution selects a valid current-repository config first, layering checked-in
  defaults, the conditional bound-knowledge `.agent-index/config.yaml`, the
  repo-local overlay, and any marketplace overlay using the same precedence
  order documented for the other `.agent-*` configs:
  machine-local > knowledge overlay > in-repo base. The one deliberate
  exception is `corpus.sources`: unlike ordinary list-valued keys, it unions by
  source `name` so those layers can compose, with the higher-precedence layer
  winning any duplicate name. Repositories that declare `stateless: true` or
  `requires_external_state_root: true` may still fall back to the knowledge
  repo's own effective config when no local repo config exists. A present
  invalid local config never falls through.
- The session-start scope-binding hook reads that effective config and tells
agents which configured scopes are safe to prefer `agent-index search` for.

## Troubleshooting quick checks

- `agent-index status` — service reachability, version, chunk count, sources,
and indexing state. Outside an opted-in repository it returns a structured,
non-mutating `inactive` result; before setup in an active repository it returns
`setup_required`.
- `agent-index role` — whether this machine is acting as `host` or `client`.
- `agent-index engine status` — durable engine health, PID, endpoint, and venv.
- `scripts/maintenance_tick.py` — a host-only deterministic maintenance body
  for agent-dispatch's script embodiment: health-checks the self-supervised
  service + durable engine, starts only what is down, then runs incremental
  `agent-index index` (never engine reprovisioning).
- Host unavailable: run `agent-index status`, `agent-index deploy --recover`,
  or the installer `start`/`update` path that owns the service cutover. Routine
  service updates do not rebuild the durable engine.
- Namespaced mode: `cell-recover` retains installation-transaction recovery, and
  the local service/runtime still remain installation-owned.
- Legacy mode: `~/.agent-index/deploy-manifest.json`, `active.json`, and
  `data/worker.log`.
- Cell mode: the validated plugin root's `deploy-manifest.json`,
  `run/zdd/active.json`, `run/endpoint.json`, `run/service-identity.json`,
  `state/`, `logs/`, and `launchers/`.
