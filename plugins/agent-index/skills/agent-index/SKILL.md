# agent-index

Use this skill when the task is about the **agent-index** plugin, its runtime
service, or retrieval through its read CLI.

## Readiness

- The command catalog appears only when the current repository has a valid
checked-in `.agent-index/config.yaml`, optionally supplemented by a repo-local
`.copilot-extensions/agent-index/config.yaml` overlay and marketplace overlay.
For repositories that require external state, the bound knowledge repo's
checked-in `.agent-index/config.yaml` is the middle **knowledge-overlay** tier.
This follows the standard `.agent-*` precedence model that agent-worktrees
documents (machine-local > knowledge overlay > in-repo), with one
deliberate exception: `corpus.sources` unions by source name instead of list
replacement so the tiers can compose. A present invalid local config never
falls through. Outside that scope, `status` reports `inactive` and other
commands are refused.
- Session start is non-mutating: it does not stamp or provision a runtime and
does not start a service. After repository opt-in, an operator explicitly chooses
`setup --single` or `setup --indexer <machine> --ssh <alias>`; that setup call
may provision only the lightweight client/base CLI (`::agent-provisioning::`).
The configured host's light `[store,server]` runtime is then provisioned and
supervised by the plugin's own installer/runtime lifecycle (`install`, `start`,
`update`, `deploy`); the durable engine remains on its own explicit `engine` /
`engine-update` path. Setup never starts the host. Automation must also pass
`--yes` and an explicit role choice. If the command is missing, the session
command catalog reports it as unavailable; surface that exact failure rather
than searching `PATH` or improvising an install.
- `<catalog argv[0]> status` is the first health check in a configured
  repository. It reports service reachability,
version, index availability, total chunks, per-source coverage, and indexing
state.
- `<catalog argv[0]> role` reports `host` (local daemon), `client` (read commands
  route to the designated indexer over SSH), or `unconfigured`.

## Retrieval path

The agent-index capability is a uniform retrieval surface **every agent calls through the
exact `argv` in its session command catalog** — there is no sub-agent, MCP-tool
wrapper, or ambient command lookup. Append the arguments shown below to the
catalog `argv`. The read subcommands:

- `<catalog argv[0]> search "<query>" [--source S] [--language L] [--repo R] [--limit N] --json`
  — meaning + lexical hybrid search. Use for conceptual/code/doc searches when
  exact tokens are unknown. Each hit has `chunk_id`, `source`, `file_path`,
  `line_start`/`line_end`, `content`.
- `<catalog argv[0]> similar <chunk_id> [--source S] [--limit N]` — pivot from a
  returned hit into related material.
- `<catalog argv[0]> clusters [--source S] [--bucket B] [--exact-dupes-only] [--limit N]`
  — list near-duplicate clusters.
- `<catalog argv[0]> status` — health and coverage map; probe this before relying on
  results.

Reindexing is **not** a retrieval action: `<catalog argv[0]> index` is an
operator/runtime step, never an agent side effect.

## CLI/operator path

Use the CLI directly when operating the runtime:

- Setup/routing: `<catalog argv[0]> setup --single`, `<catalog argv[0]> setup
  --indexer <machine> --ssh <alias>`, `<catalog argv[0]> role`,
  `<catalog argv[0]> capability --json`.
- Service: `<catalog argv[0]> status`. `start`, `serve`, `restart`, and
  `deploy` manage the local host directly. `install` / `update` own the same
  lifecycle and use zdd cutover for live replacement. Stop remains
  ownership-checked.
- Index refresh: `<catalog argv[0]> index [--source S] [--full]`. Incremental is the
default; `--full` is explicit.
- Engine daemon: `<catalog argv[0]> engine status|start|stop|run`.

## Scope and fallback

- The session-start scope-binding hook emits `corpus.sources` from the same
layered config used by the CLI gate.
- For a plain repo with no corpus config, the catalog command's `index`
subcommand defaults to the
current git checkout (`git`) and its commits.
- Use direct `grep`/`glob` for exact strings, files outside indexed scopes, or when
the catalog command's `status` subcommand shows the index is unavailable.
- Query-time trust-domain enforcement is not implemented; when a request is
clearly scoped, pass `source` or `repo` rather than doing an unscoped search.

## Troubleshooting

- Service down on a host: run/check `<catalog argv[0]> status`, then use the
installer/runtime lifecycle that owns the host (`install`, `start`, `update`,
`deploy --recover`). Session start never starts the daemon.
- Client cannot search: run inside a repo with `.agent-index/config.yaml`
`indexer.ssh` or set `AGENT_INDEX_REPO`; the CLI read transport needs a project
to choose the SSH target.
- Engine issues: `<catalog argv[0]> engine status` shows durable engine health, PID,
endpoint, and venv provisioning state.
- Interrupted host cutover: inspect the local zdd routing/runtime state and use
`deploy --recover`; do not hand-edit markers or manifests to pick a generation.
