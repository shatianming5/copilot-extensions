# bootstrap-killswitch-guard.ps1 -- canonical, vendored byte-identically into
# every plugin that ships a sessionStart bootstrap-check hook (see
# tools/sync-bootstrap-killswitch.py). PowerShell counterpart of
# bootstrap-killswitch-guard.sh -- see that file's header for the full design
# rationale; this file must stay behaviorally equivalent.
#
# State lives in ONE shared, cross-plugin file:
#   $HOME/.copilot-extensions/bootstrap-killswitch.json
#   {"active": true, "reason": "...", "set_by": "...", "set_at": "..."}
#
# Primary usage -- from the FIRST lines of any bootstrap-check.ps1:
#   $guard = Join-Path $ScriptDir 'bootstrap-killswitch-guard.ps1'
#   if (Test-Path $guard) {
#     & $guard check
#     if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { [Console]::Out.Write('{}'); exit 0 }
#   }
# (PowerShell has no stream-merge-into-stderr operator analogous to bash's
# `>&2` -- only `N>&1` merging into the success stream is supported, so
# there's nothing valid to redirect here. Not a problem in practice: `check`
# never writes to stdout -- its only output is via [Console]::Error.WriteLine,
# which writes straight to the real stderr handle regardless of any
# PowerShell-level redirection.)
# Exit 0 -> killswitch ACTIVE; caller must skip its own reconcile.
# Exit 1 -> killswitch INACTIVE, or state file missing/unreadable/malformed.
#           Fails OPEN to "inactive" deliberately (see .sh header).
#
# Secondary usage -- direct operator/agent control:
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.ps1 on "<reason>"
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.ps1 off
#   bootstrap-killswitch-guard.ps1 status
