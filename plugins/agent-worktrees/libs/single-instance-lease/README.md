# single-instance-lease -- one live daemon per service per host

Service-neutral primitives that make "at most one active daemon owns a given
service on a host" an *asserted, repairable* property. Extracted from
agent-bridge (which proved the design in production) so multiple consumers reuse
one implementation instead of reinventing it.

- **Distribution:** `agent-single-instance-lease` (the `agent-` prefix avoids
  PyPI dependency-confusion; the package is never published to an index --
  consumers install it from a local path).
- **Import module:** `single_instance_lease`
- **Runtime deps:** none (pure stdlib).

Realizes the `single-instance-lease` behavior of the plugin-services vision: a
service acquires a host-local lease before it becomes the active endpoint; a
process that cannot acquire it stands down rather than racing; ownership is
liveness-reconciled, not timer-guessed; and a cutover reconciles the full set,
retiring every predecessor *and* every stray a plain restart would strand.

## What's inside

### `lease` -- the single-instance lease

`SingleInstance` takes an OS-level, exclusive, non-blocking lock on a lock file
and holds it for the process lifetime. Because the kernel releases the lock when
the holder dies (graceful exit, crash, kill, or power loss), ownership is
**liveness-reconciled by construction** -- a lease held by a dead process is
immediately acquirable, and there is never a stale lock to "detect" or "reclaim".

```python
from single_instance_lease import SingleInstance, AlreadyRunningError

lease = SingleInstance("~/.agent-vault", service="agent-vault", port=9820)
try:
    lease.acquire()          # raises AlreadyRunningError if one is live
except AlreadyRunningError as exc:
    ...                      # a peer already owns it -- stand down
else:
    try:
        run_server()         # keep `lease` referenced for the daemon's life
    finally:
        lease.release()
```

Keying on the optional `port` lets an active and a passive daemon coexist on one
`lock_dir` during a zero-downtime cutover (they bind different ports, so they
take different locks), while two starts on the *same* port still collide.
Cross-platform: `fcntl.flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows.

### `supersession` -- the self-retire decision

`is_superseded(table, my_pid, my_generation)` is the pure, fail-safe decision a
*demoted* daemon uses to exit on its own once a live, strictly-newer generation
has taken over. It operates on a plain routing-table `dict` (the `active` /
`previous` shape published by `zdd.routing`) so the library has **no routing-lib
dependency** -- the consumer reads the table however it likes. Returns `True`
only when the `active` entry is a *different* pid, at a *strictly higher*
generation, that is *actually listening*; every ambiguous state returns `False`
(stay alive).

### `reaper` -- the reconcile-set backstop

`reconcile_set_reap(own_pids, active_pid=..., terminate=...)` retires every one
of a service's own processes that is not `active` (nor `self`), fail-soft. The
caller supplies pids it has **positively identified** as this service's own
(identity is the caller's responsibility -- the guard against pid reuse) plus a
`terminate` callback; the reaper applies only the policy. `superseded_pids_from_table`
is a helper that harvests candidate stray pids from a routing-table `dict`.

## Testing

```
cd libs/single-instance-lease
python -m pytest
```

## Vendoring

**In dev**, every consumer's `pyproject.toml` references this library through
a `uv`-editable canonical pointer (`vendor-pointer-generalization` effort,
Phase 1) --
`agent-single-instance-lease = { path = "../../libs/single-instance-lease",
editable = true }` -- so every consumer resolves to this one source tree; there
is no per-plugin dev copy to keep in sync.

**At release**, `tools/materialize_main.py` rewrites that same pointer into a
real, promoted copy at `plugins/<plugin>/libs/single-instance-lease/` for each
consumer -- non-editable, so a published plugin installs a self-contained
source tree with no cross-plugin `path` reference. `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py
--check` verifies every materialized copy's `src/` tree and version stay
byte-identical to this canonical one and to each other.
