def test_close_does_not_call_shutdown_before_serve_forever_is_confirmed_running(monkeypatch):
    """Copilot review finding: ``Thread.start()`` returning successfully
    only proves the OS thread object was created, not that
    ``serve_forever()`` has actually begun executing yet -- and even once
    the thread's target callable is running, ``serve_forever()`` itself
    hasn't necessarily entered its accept loop. ``close()`` must gate
    ``self._server.shutdown()`` on ``_serve_running`` (set only from
    ``_Server.service_actions()``, a hook ``serve_forever()`` itself calls
    on every accept-loop iteration -- the earliest point that genuinely
    proves the loop entered), never on ``_serve_started`` (thread-creation)
    alone -- otherwise a ``close()`` racing an in-flight ``start()`` could
    call ``shutdown()`` before the loop is truly running.

    This test deliberately drives the pathological "loop never confirms
    running" path documented in ``close()``'s own docstring: since
    ``_serve_running`` is never set here, ``close()`` correctly skips
    ``shutdown()`` and never signals the real (still-running)
    ``serve_forever()`` loop to stop. That loop's own next
    ``selector.select()`` against the now-closed socket then raises an
    ``OSError`` and the daemon thread dies noisily but harmlessly --
    exactly the documented fallback for a thread that "does eventually
    run" after ``close()`` gave up waiting. Suppressing the resulting
    ``PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning`` here is deliberate, not a
    swallowed real failure: it is intrinsic to this specific edge case,
    not present in the ordinary start/close path (see the sibling
    ``test_close_shuts_down_promptly_...`` test)."""
