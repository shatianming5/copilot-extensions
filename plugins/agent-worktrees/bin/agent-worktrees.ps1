# Sanitize inherited Python runtime variables before dispatching to the
# resolved, architecture-correct runtime-slot interpreter (#2411). A stray
# mismatched-architecture PYTHONHOME/PYTHONPATH -- set at Windows User scope,
# inherited from a parent shell, or leaked from an unrelated venv activation
# -- otherwise survives into every dispatch below and can crash the resolved
# interpreter (e.g. an x64 PYTHONHOME under an ARM64 python.exe fails
# `import socket` with "DLL load failed"). This is the same sanitization
# class #2359 applied to Worktree Manager's own engine-launch subprocesses,
# applied here at the binstub entry point so it protects every direct
# invocation, not only Manager-spawned children. Clearing these here is safe
# regardless of downstream provisioning path: this script never itself
# imports Python modules, and the resolved interpreter's own site/venv
# machinery re-establishes whatever of these it legitimately needs.
#
# AGENT_RT_ROOT is included here too (#3220): unlike every other plugin's
# binstub, which sets this variable itself immediately before dot-sourcing
# the shared resolver, `resolve-runtime.ps1`'s local `_awr` fallback here
# honors an *inherited* AGENT_RT_ROOT as an override. A value leaked from
# another plugin's debugging session (Windows User/Machine scope, or baked
# into a long-lived parent process' environment) then silently hijacks this
# resolver into a different plugin's venv, failing with an opaque
# "No module named agent_worktrees". Clearing it here restores this
# binstub's own default (`~/.agent-worktrees`) every time, matching the
# canonical per-invocation-scoping contract every other plugin follows.

# from the snapshot the stamp recorded, then dispatch. Opt out with
