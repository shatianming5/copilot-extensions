"""agent-worktrees disposition nudge -- a Copilot CLI ``postToolUse`` command hook.

Keeps the Worktree Picker's disposition (summary / title / follow-up) honest on a
long run. The static ``sessionStart`` conduct is delivered exactly ONCE, so on a
lengthy session the summary/title silently go stale -- only the agent knows the
focus moved. This hook fires after each successful tool call, maintains a tiny
per-worktree drift counter + timer sidecar, and injects a lean reminder to run
``agent-worktrees status --summary`` (and ``--title`` when the focus changed) once
the agent has drifted far enough from its last disposition write.

Wiring: agent-worktrees' ``hooks.json`` declares a ``postToolUse`` command hook
that runs this script (deployed to ``~/.agent-worktrees/bin/``). The hook payload
arrives as JSON on **stdin**; a due nudge is written as JSON to **stdout**:

    {"additionalContext": "<reminder>"}

Anything else (empty output) is a no-op -- the tool result passes through
unchanged.

**Reactive, never a scheduler.** ``postToolUse`` fires only while the agent is
actively using tools -- never on a clock and never when idle. That is exactly
when a re-nudge is useful, so it is a good fit; it just cannot wake an idle
session (no hook can).

**Fail-open + advisory.** A nudge is never a blocker. This wraps everything and,
on ANY error, emits nothing and exits 0.

Reset semantics (``on_status_write_or_finalize``): the counter/timer reset when
the agent writes ANY disposition -- ``agent-worktrees status
--summary/--title/--follow-up/--resolved`` stamps ``status_note_at``, which this
hook watches -- and when the worktree is finalized (``finalize`` removes the
sidecar).

Thresholds (defaults; env-overridable): nudge when the drift since the last
disposition write reaches **>= AGENT_WORKTREES_NUDGE_CALLS** (25) tool calls OR
**>= AGENT_WORKTREES_NUDGE_MINUTES** (20) minutes. After a nudge the window
resets, so the next one needs another full threshold (no per-call spam).

Kill switch: ``AGENT_WORKTREES_NUDGE=off`` (or ``0``/``false``/``no``).
