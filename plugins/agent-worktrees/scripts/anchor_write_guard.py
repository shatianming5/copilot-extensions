"""Anchor-write guard -- a Copilot CLI ``preToolUse`` command hook.

Blocks an agent from writing directly into the **anchor** (the main checkout) of
a **worktree-class** repo. Such a repo is only ever edited through an
agent-worktrees *linked worktree* -- committing/editing in the anchor is a latent
hazard (a stray anchor commit, a dirty anchor that blocks pulls, work that never
lands through the PR flow). Reading the anchor is fine; **writing** is denied with
a nudge to create/use a worktree, plus the break-glass escape hatch.

It is the third member of the write-routing guard family, complementing:
  * ``statelessness_guard`` -- blocks personal-state writes INTO a stateless
    harness (route to the bound knowledge repo).
  * ``cross_repo_guard`` -- blocks writes INTO an agent-guarded *related* repo
    (delegate to that repo's own in-repo agent).
  * ``anchor_write_guard`` (this one) -- blocks writes INTO the *current* repo's
    anchor when that repo is worktree-class (edit a worktree instead).

Wiring: agent-worktrees' ``hooks.json`` declares a ``preToolUse`` command hook
that runs this script (deployed to ``~/.agent-worktrees/bin/``). The hook payload
arrives as JSON on **stdin**; the decision is written as JSON to **stdout**:

    {"permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "<nudge>"}

Anything else (empty / an allow) lets the tool proceed.

**How anchor vs. worktree is told apart (robustly).** For a write target, the
guard finds the nearest enclosing checkout (walks up to ``.git``). A *linked
worktree* has ``.git`` as a **file** (a gitdir pointer) -- those always pass. The
*main checkout* has ``.git`` as a **directory**; if that directory is a repo
registered ``class: worktree`` in ``~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml``, the write is
an anchor edit and is denied. Singleton / reference repos (``.git`` dir but not
worktree-class -- e.g. SPO.Core) are never blocked.

**Fail-open by construction.** ``preToolUse`` command hooks are fail-closed on a
non-zero exit (a crash would DENY every tool). So this script wraps everything
and, on ANY error or ambiguity, emits nothing and exits 0. It only denies on a
clear write into a confirmed worktree-class anchor. It is cheap: one small
``repos.yaml`` read (stdlib parse; no subprocess) plus a couple of ``.git``
stats.

Escape hatches / modes:
  * ``ANCHOR_WRITE_GUARD=off`` (or 0/false/no) disables it entirely.
  * ``CROSS_REPO_GUARD=off`` is honored as a shared master kill switch for the
    write-routing guard family.
  * ``ANCHOR_WRITE_GUARD_MODE=deny|ask|warn|off`` (default ``deny``) picks the
    action on a hit.
  * ``git pull --ff-only`` (and a bare ``git fetch`` alone, which never
    mutates the working tree) is never blocked on an anchor: git structurally
    refuses to create a merge commit or apply a configured ``pull.rebase``
    when a fast-forward isn't possible, so this exact form can never
    introduce the agent-authored content ("no agent-authored content" is
    this guard's whole invariant) that a stray edit/commit would. A bare
    ``git pull`` (no ``--ff-only``) remains blocked like any other write-sub
    verb -- on a diverged anchor its default merge WOULD create a genuine
    new local merge commit, or a configured rebase would rewrite existing
    ones. ``agent-worktrees repos sync <repo>`` is the always-available
    equivalent (fetch + ``merge --ff-only``, skipping rather than forcing a
    dirty/diverged/detached checkout) when a plain ``--ff-only`` pull isn't
    convenient to type.
  * ``agent-worktrees repos allow-edits <repo> --reason "..."`` opens a
    time-boxed break-glass (``~/.agent-worktrees/allow-edits.json``) the guard
    honors.
