"""Regression test for #2650: `python -m agent_worktrees` must not crash.

The binstub (and every documented "direct" invocation) launches this CLI as
`python -m agent_worktrees`, which runs `__main__.py` under the synthetic
`"__main__"` module name -- a SEPARATE `sys.modules` entry from its real
qualified name `agent_worktrees.__main__`. `pr_cli.py` does `from . import
__main__ as core` at module scope; absent the `sys.modules.setdefault` alias
`__main__.py` installs at the top of the file, that import finds no
`agent_worktrees.__main__` entry yet and re-executes the entire module a
second time, crashing with "partially initialized module 'agent_worktrees.pr_cli'
has no attribute ..." once it reaches the `pr_cli` re-import while the first
`pr_cli` import is still in flight.

This is a real subprocess test (not a monkeypatched import) because the bug
only reproduces via genuine `-m` execution -- a plain `from agent_worktrees
import __main__` (as pytest's own collection does) never hits it.
