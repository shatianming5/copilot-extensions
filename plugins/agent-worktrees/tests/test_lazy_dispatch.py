"""Validation for the agent-cli-lazy-dispatch effort's Phase 1 fast path.

Covers the Phase 1 Validation Plan items not yet exercised at the time of
landing (ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3309/#3312/#3313):

- The `_LAZY_DISPATCH_TABLE` (command -> (module, handler_attr)) cannot go
  stale relative to the real argparse registrations: regenerate it via the
  same introspection method documented in the table's own comment and diff.
- A fast-tracked command's dispatch never calls `build_parser()` (the whole
  point of the fast path); a non-fast-tracked command still does.
- `--help` for a fast-tracked command produces output identical to what the
  full `build_parser()` would have produced for that same subcommand.

Phase 1b (decoupling the `_core()` cross-module helper cluster) adds:

- `_CLUSTER_FREE_MODULES` cannot go stale relative to the real `_core()`
  call-shapes in every dispatch-table module: regenerate it via the
  AST-based scanner in `_core_cluster_scan.py` and diff.
- A cluster-free fast-tracked command genuinely never triggers
  `_ensure_cluster_loaded()`; a not-yet-decoupled one still does (both must
  hold, or the differentiation this Phase adds is untested/vacuous).
