"""Tests for the ``session_conclude``/``session_link_succession`` verbs
(agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon effort, Phase 3's fourth migrated
call-site cluster).

Covers the verb functions directly (the lifecycle-error rejections, the
head-clearing/moving behavior) and one end-to-end proof that
``tracking_write.dispatch`` reaches the exact same functions via a real,
live daemon.
