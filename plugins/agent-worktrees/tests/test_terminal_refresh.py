"""Regression guards for the Windows Terminal profile refresh resolution.

dotfiles#211: `register`'s WT-profile refresh silently no-op'd because the
installer script was resolved *only* from the deploy-manifest's `plugin_source`,
which is empty after a marketplace install. The resolver must fall back to the
installed-plugin dir and warn (not silently return) when nothing is found.

dotfiles#563: the mirror ran the full `install.ps1 update` (~60s+) under a 30s
subprocess timeout, so it was killed before the fragment was regenerated and the
failure was swallowed while `mirrored: true` was still reported. The refresh now
runs the narrow `refresh-profiles` action, passes the active project explicitly,
and returns an accurate success bool.
