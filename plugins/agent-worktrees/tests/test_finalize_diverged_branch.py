"""Tests for finalize's content-on-upstream check validating the worktree's
ACTUAL current checkout, not a possibly-stale tracked branch name (#7723).

Before the fix, ``validate_and_finalize`` resolved the branch to check via
``_worktree_branch(record, worktree_id)`` -- the originally-tracked
``record.branch`` from the worktree's creation-time tracking record -- and
used it unconditionally, even when the worktree's checkout had since moved to
a differently-named branch (e.g. a ``-journal`` suffix variant) or ended up
detached. That produced both a false "Unmerged work detected" verdict (when
the stale tracked name was actually behind but the real checkout was safe)
and, in the opposite direction, a silent false-pass (when the tracked name
happened to be safe but the real checkout held something genuinely different).

These exercise the new ``_resolve_finalize_ref`` helper directly against real
temporary git repos -- the same style as ``test_finalize_precondition.py``.
