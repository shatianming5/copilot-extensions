"""Tests for the soft ``--project`` scope note on machine-global verbs.

``--project`` has no effect on a machine-global verb
(``repos``/``accounts``/``picker``/``--version``/``--help``). The guard emits a
**soft, non-fatal** stderr note for a likely-mistaken explicit one -- but ONLY
when the project name is *unregistered*, because a real project binstub always
injects a registered project. It never blocks and requires no binstub/env
cooperation, so older deployed binstubs keep working unchanged (the earlier
hard-bounce + ``AGENT_WORKTREES_PROJECT_ROUTED`` marker approach broke stale
binstubs -- follow-up to #1108).
