"""Tests for the provable-liveness lock-file primitive (#4272).

The shared mechanism of the session-state lattice: a JSON lock file whose
liveness is proved by PID + process start-time, so a crash (no teardown) leaves
a detectably stale lock rather than a false "alive". Covers the round-trip, the
start-time reuse guard, fail-open on an unprovable-but-alive owner, and
best-effort I/O (torn/absent files never raise).

# _pid_alive doubles as the launcher-shell reaper's parent-liveness veto, where a
# false "dead" gets a LIVE process killed. The actual OS-level probe (and its
# fail-open contract on an unprovable pid -- an access-denied answer proves the
# pid exists, so it must read alive) now lives in single_instance_lease, the
# same primitive the self-retire/reaper backstop uses (process-slot-ownership
# Phase 4, the downstream tracker); its own test suite covers that contract. This
# module's own guard is the ``pid <= 0`` short-circuit and the delegation itself.
