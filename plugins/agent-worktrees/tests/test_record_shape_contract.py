"""Cross-effort record-shape contract for the picker's normalized row.

Two efforts share ONE normalized picker row (``picker_tui.derive.norm``) and one
row-builder (each view's ``build_data`` -> ``_build_data_vrows`` -> BOTH the
text-line and native ``OptionList`` bodies, which are golden grid-parity-tested):

* ``picker-session-state-signals`` WRITES the liveness signals onto the record --
  ``mux_live`` / ``attached`` (mux presence), ``session_lock_live`` /
  ``session_bare_orphan`` / ``last_session_id`` (the bound-Copilot binding), and
  the ``live_intent`` / ``live_pulse`` activity pulse.
* ``picker-list-interaction-layer`` READS + transforms the record for
  filter / sort / multi-select over ``id4`` / ``title`` / ``cleanup_bucket`` /
  ``ff_eligible`` / machine+env.

The two efforts must not fight over the shape: any list-interaction transform
(filter/sort/select -- the effort's Phase 4) operates over, and must PRESERVE,
the SAME record, and a refactor of ``norm`` must keep every field both efforts
depend on. The golden grid-parity tests already guarantee the two BODIES render
identically -- but a *symmetric* drop of a field would pass parity while silently
losing the signal, so this contract test pins field PRESENCE on the single
normalized record, independent of rendering. A failure here means the two efforts
have drifted apart over the record shape (see
``efforts/active/picker-session-state-signals`` and
``efforts/active/picker-list-interaction-layer``).
