"""Tests for the account-conduct guidance, now delivered via the session-conduct
sessionStart hook.

Migrated (dotfiles#1053 / effort instructions-to-hooks) from a per-project
``account-conduct.instructions.md`` loaded via COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS.
The static guidance text now lives in ``scripts/conduct/account-conduct.md`` and
is emitted as ``additionalContext`` by the cwd-gated session-conduct hook; the
deploy path only retires any stale copy of the old file.
