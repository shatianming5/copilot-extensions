# The Worktree Manager Picker

The interactive **Picker** now lives in the standalone **Worktree Manager**.
Running a project binstub with no arguments (`my-project`) hands off to that
manager when it is installed; otherwise the plugin surfaces the guided
install/onboarding trigger instead of a bundled in-plugin TUI. This is the
operator walkthrough for that front door; for the agent-worktrees engine-side
pivot-registry internals see
[architecture.md § Picker Pivot Registry](architecture.md#picker-pivot-registry-cross-plugin),
and for the states and landing flow see
[worktree-lifecycle.md](worktree-lifecycle.md).

## What happens when you launch a binstub

```
my-project                         # bare project binstub (no subcommand)
   │
   ▼
launch-session.{ps1,sh}            # ① pre-flight freshness (see below)
   │
   ▼
agent-worktrees resolve            # ② engine resolution; when Worktree Manager is
   │                                  installed the Picker drives this boundary
   ▼
knowledge plugin composition       # ③ paired harness only; settings.local.json
   │                                  is ready before Copilot plugin discovery
   ▼
setup script                       # ④ tools/setup/setup.{ps1,sh} (or config launch:)
   │                                  install deps, set env, print status
   ▼
Copilot CLI session                # ⑤ your work happens here (often in a mux pane)
   │
   ▼
post-exit checks                   # ⑥ detect completion; finalize if pushed
```

Running the bare binstub opens the Worktree Manager Picker when available, or
the install trigger when it is not. To **skip** the Picker entirely and drive
worktrees programmatically, use `agent-worktrees create [--json]` (no launch) or
`agent-worktrees resolve --new` (create + launch a muxed session) — see
[cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md). Why sessions run in a multiplexer at all
(and when to skip it) is covered in [Multiplexed Sessions](mux.md).

> **The bare-invocation seam (Phase 6).** A bare, no-args `<project>` is the
> *human-facing* path, and it resolves through a **seam**: if the out-of-plugin
> **Worktree Manager** (`worktree-manager`) is on PATH, the engine hands off to
> it; otherwise it shows the trustworthy install trigger. Any *args* route
> programmatically to the tool CLI and never touch the seam, so an agent running
> `<project> <verb>` never loads a Picker. The Manager reaches the engine only via
> its machine-readable verbs — see the
> [engine ↔ Picker `--json` contract](engine-picker-contract.md). (The seam lives
> in the CLI so bare invocation always resolves sanely even through a stale
> binstub; see the Phase 6 effort for the never-break 6a→6c sequence.)
>
> **With no Manager installed.** Bare `<project>` prints the Manager's
> verifiable source
> (`https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions`) and the platform install
> one-liner (`worktree-manager/bootstrap.{sh,ps1}`) so a user who was on the full
> version is guided to install it — never a silent break, and never an
> auto-executed remote script.

### ① Freshness done for you at launch

Before the Picker paints, the launcher brings the environment up to date so you
never work against a stale tree or runtime:

- **Pre-flight auto-update** — if the anchor repo has new commits affecting the
  worktree manager, the launcher re-runs the installer. Skip with `--no-update`
  or `WORKTREE_NO_UPDATE=1`; the Picker then shows **Updates paused** and does
  not expose a refresh action from another launch's staged-update status.
- **Repo-adopted plugin reconciliation** — for each `<name>@copilot-extensions`
  in the anchor's `.github/copilot/settings.json`, the launcher ensures the
  payload is installed and its runtime matches (version-keyed, so an unchanged
  relaunch does ~no work). Opt out with `WORKTREE_NO_RECONCILE=1`. See
  [install-contract.md § Automatic reconciliation at launch](../../../docs/install-contract.md#automatic-reconciliation-at-launch-runtimescope).
- **Auto-fast-forward** — resuming a *clean, strictly-behind* worktree
  fast-forwards it first (never a worktree with local commits). Disable with
  `--no-fast-forward` or `auto_fast_forward: false`.
- **Paired knowledge plugins** — after you select a tracked harness worktree,
  `agent-worktrees knowledge compose-plugins` refreshes its ignored local
  settings from the paired knowledge worktree. Directory marketplaces therefore
  resolve to that worktree (not the knowledge anchor), and operator-specific
  remote marketplaces/enables are available before Copilot starts. A stale
  tracked harness pair safely retires its exact marker-owned overlay; ordinary
  unpaired repos are unchanged. If settings cannot be sanitized exactly, launch
  stops before Copilot can discover stale plugins.

## The Picker screen

The default (Textual TUI) picker is organized into **regions** you move between
with `Tab`:

```
┌ my-project ───────────────────────────────────── ⚙ Configuration ┐   ← title + Config menu
│  ◀ Worktrees │ Tasks ▶                                            │   ← view pivots

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   Space: select · Enter: sub-menu for worktree 8e45 · Tab region · ^◀▶ machine   ← live footer
```

- **View pivots** — `Worktrees` is the home view. Other plugins can contribute
  pivots (e.g. a `Tasks` pivot from a task-queue plugin); they appear here
  automatically via a filesystem manifest, with no agent-worktrees code change
  (mechanism: [architecture.md](architecture.md#picker-pivot-registry-cross-plugin)).
- **Machine tabs** — one tab per registered machine plus **All machines**. The
  local host git-classifies its own worktrees; remote machines report their state
  over SSH.
- **Worktree rows** — each shows machine · environment · `repo:id4` and a **state
  block** (`WIP`, `DIRTY`, `UNUSED`, `CONVO 💬N`, `FINAL`, `MERGED`, `ORPHAN`) with an
  `↑ahead`/`↓behind` sync tag. Same vocabulary as the status bar and
  [worktree-lifecycle.md § states](worktree-lifecycle.md#worktree-states). The
  `RELATION` column independently summarizes reciprocal session metadata as
  `BOUND`, `CONTROL`, `HANDOFF`, `TERM`, or `AMBIG`; the legacy ANSI Picker
  appends the same tag to each worktree label. This presentation never changes
  the git/lifecycle state block or which session is authoritative for resume.
  The
  `LIVE` column distinguishes an attached (`●N`) or detached (`○`) terminal
  multiplexer, a live Copilot process without a mux (`PROC`), and stale PID-lock
  residue without a live process (`LOCK`).
- **⚙ Configuration** menu — hosts **Profiles** (user-local Copilot backend
  profiles; never repo-managed) and other settings. Installed plugins can
  **contribute their own sections** here (an SSH layer an "SSH" home, an MCP
  layer an "MCP" home) via a `config_sections` entry in their pivot manifest.

### Navigating — read the footer

Keys are **contextual**, and the footer always spells out exactly what `Enter`
and `Space` do for the current focus — read it rather than memorizing. The
constants:

| Key | Does |
|-----|------|
| `Tab` | Move to the next region (view tabs → machine tabs → list → buttons → …) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move within the list / grid |
| `◀` / `▶` | Switch the focused tab set (view, or machine, or a button pair) |
| `Ctrl+◀` / `Ctrl+▶` | Switch machine tab from anywhere |
| `[` / `]` | Cycle the view pivot |
| `Enter` | Context action for the focus — focus a region, open a worktree's action sub-menu, press a button, apply staged changes |
| `Space` | Select / deselect the focused worktree row (multi-select set) |

> On **Windows over SSH** the TUI auto-falls back to a simpler legacy picker
> (a ConPTY keyboard limitation). This fallback is automatic and unconditional
> -- there is no supported way to opt out of the Textual picker otherwise; the
> legacy picker is retired everywhere else.

## Core actions

### Resume a worktree
Focus a row and press `Enter` for its action sub-menu; **resume** runs the setup
script and launches the Copilot session in that worktree (fast-forwarding it
first if it's clean and behind).

### Create a worktree
Focus the **New worktree** button and press `Enter`. It branches a fresh
worktree from the up-to-date default branch **on the selected machine tab's
machine/environment**, then launches into it. (Programmatic equivalent:
`agent-worktrees create` — no launch.)

If the multiplexer is temporarily unable to create the session, the launcher
retries three times before offering an interactive retry. Exhaustion preserves
the new worktree and prints the exact command for reopening that same worktree;
it does not create another worktree or silently fall back to a non-persistent
session.

### Per-worktree actions
`Enter` on a row opens its sub-menu — resume, plus context actions such as
**Jump to host** for a bridge/system row (navigates to the owning machine tab and
highlights the worktree by its stable id). A worktree with one validated,
unambiguous controller target also offers **Go to controller**. That action
navigates to the exact loaded local or remote worktree row; it never rebinds the
child or substitutes the controller for the child's resume target.

Installed plugins can **contribute their own actions** onto this sub-menu (e.g. a
bridge's "Send message", a dispatcher's "Dispatch task here") via a
`worktree_actions` entry in their pivot manifest — so the more of the fabric you
adopt, the more a worktree row can do. See
[architecture.md § Picker Pivot Registry](architecture.md#picker-pivot-registry-cross-plugin).

### Steering a blocked task — the Steer form (the DISPATCH pivot)
A registered pivot's `kind: "form"` action lets an operator answer a worker that
blocked on input (the agent-dispatch card/steer seam). On the **Tasks** pivot, a
task that is **awaiting steer** gains a **Steer** verb (gated
`when: {awaiting_steer: true}`) — a **docked card + elicitation** modal in the
Copilot-CLI style:

- The card's **prose fills the top** (scrollable); any http(s) URL in it renders
  as a clickable/hover-expandable hyperlink.
- A **docked** section at the bottom presents the worker's questions as **tabs**
  (one per question, read from the card's `request_input`): a single-select
  (`choice`), multi-select (`multichoice`), or free-form **auto-expanding** text
  box (grows with content, up to ~10 lines). A choice/multichoice may declare an
  **"Other…"** option (a trailing `*` in the spec, e.g. `severity:choice[low,high,*]`)
  that reveals a free-text box.
- **Keyboard flow** (Copilot-CLI muscle memory): in a text box **Enter accepts &
  advances** to the next field, **Shift+Enter inserts a newline**; on a choice
  **Space toggles and stays**, **Enter toggles and advances** (Enter that lands
  on "Other…" focuses its box). **Ctrl+←/→** switch tabs. On the last field Enter
  moves focus onto **Confirm** (it does not auto-submit).
- A single-line button row: **Confirm** (submit), **Save** (persist a resumable
  draft and close — survives Escape or a kill), **Cancel** (discard). `Ctrl+S`
  saves; `Esc` saves and closes.

On Confirm the answers substitute into the action's `run` (`{field.<name>}` per
name, or `{fields}` to submit every question) and call `agent-dispatch steer
submit …`, which wakes the worker. Saved drafts live under
`~/.agent-worktrees/steer-drafts/<task-id>.json` (overridable via
`AGENT_WORKTREES_STEER_DRAFTS`), so a half-answered card can be resumed later.

(A read-only `kind: "card"` action — a scrollable card-detail overlay — remains a
general pivot capability, but the Tasks pivot no longer uses it: the Steer form
already shows the full card prose.)

This is a **general** steering surface (any blocked dispatched agent can use it),
and it is **never a verdict path** — it only carries the operator's answer back
to the worker.

**Messages** (read-only) peeks the last few conversation turns of the worktree's
latest session in an overlay, so you can tell what a worktree was doing — and
whether it still needs follow-up — without opening it. This is the read-side
companion to the disposition summary: it derives recent context straight from the
session's `events.jsonl` even when the agent-asserted summary never accumulated.
`↑`/`↓` scroll; `Esc` closes. Local worktrees load in-process; a remote worktree's
messages are fetched over SSH. (Backed by the `recent-messages` CLI verb.)

### Worktree types & visibility (origin × interface)

Every worktree carries two orthogonal marks (see
[architecture.md § The Worktree Record](architecture.md#the-worktree-record----single-writer-contract-invariant)):

- **Interface** — how it's *driven now*: an interactive terminal Copilot
  (**CLI**) or a programmatically driven session (**ACP** — a Neuron Forge /
  agent-bridge session). Derived from `kind` (a `bridge` worktree is ACP) unless
  explicitly stamped.
- **Origin** — *who kicked it off*: the operator via the Picker or Neuron Forge
  (**User**), a background/scheduled process (**System**), or one agent spawning
  another (**Delegate**). Derived from `kind` + the caller heuristic (a bridge
  worktree with no `caller_worktree` is the operator's — User; with one, a
  Delegate) unless explicitly stamped.

Rows are prefixed with the type in brackets — `[acp]`, `[system]`, `[delegate]`
— so an operator-owned Neuron Forge session reads distinctly from the machine's
own automation. A plain interactive CLI session carries no prefix (the common
case stays uncluttered).

**Visibility keys on _origin_, not kind.** The Picker foregrounds the operator's
own work — **User** on *either* interface, so an ACP session you started in
Neuron Forge is shown here by default, symmetric with the NF cockpit. **System +
Delegate** worktrees are tucked behind the **Toggle-hidden** button (they stay
synced, recoverable, and cleanup-exempt — visibility is decoupled from
lifecycle). This is why a bridge/ACP worktree is *shown* yet still lifecycle-
managed: `is_picker_hidden` (origin ∈ {system, delegate}) drives the row's
`hidden` flag, independent of the kind-based cleanup exemption.

### Deprecated advanced recovery (Bare resume + Reclaim)

**Bare resume is deprecated.** The extension-reload startup outage it was added
for is fixed in Copilot CLI 1.0.81-10 and later. The action remains available
temporarily as an advanced diagnostic fallback for a future cwd-specific startup
failure, but normal **Resume** is the supported path and Bare resume is expected
to be removed after a compatibility period.

When needed, the worktree row's sub-menu supports a manual two-step restore that
keeps the correct mux identity:

- **The session id is shown** in the sub-menu header (with a *bound (lock live)*
  flag when a Copilot process currently holds the session's `inuse.<pid>.lock`),
  so you can copy it for the `/resume`.
- **Bare resume (deprecated)** creates the worktree's `wt-<id>` mux (correct
  identity + status bar) but launches Copilot in the **home** directory with
  **no `--resume`**. It prints the `/resume <id>` line to run inside.
  (CLI: `resolve --worktree-id <id> --bare-resume`.)
- **Reclaim** appears whenever a live `inuse.<pid>.lock` binds a Copilot process —
  including a **bare** Copilot with no mux session, which **Stop** cannot reach.
  It kills the exact bound process (bare orphans only; a healthy muxed sibling is
  left to Stop) so the session can be re-Opened or Bare-resumed cleanly. (Backed
  by the `reclaim` CLI verb.)

Advanced fallback flow: **Reclaim** the wedged/bare process, then **Bare resume
(deprecated)** and `/resume <id>` inside.

### Bulk Cleanup and Sync
The **Cleanup** and **Sync** buttons on the Worktrees row open dialogs that act
across worktrees:
- **Cleanup** removes `completed` and `gone` worktrees (a commit-less
  `unused`/`convo` worktree is preserved unless you opt in — it may hold planning
  or conversation).
- **Sync** fast-forwards clean, strictly-behind worktrees to the default branch
  (never rebases or discards local commits).

`Space` multi-selects rows first, so Cleanup/Sync (and other batch actions) apply
to an exact chosen set.

### Backend profiles
Open **⚙ Configuration → Profiles** to Tab-cycle the Copilot backend profiles
declared in `copilot_profiles`, toggle a host→target mapping, and **Apply** (or
**Reset**) the grid. These are user-local settings, never repo-managed.

A host that has never been curated (no persisted `terminal_profiles` column) is
shown with the **default column**: minimal per-agent + bare cross-machine — the
host's own launcher (self·agent diagonal) plus a plain `ssh <machine>` shell for
every other machine. No remote agent-launch combos and no local shells are
emitted by default; the operator adds those explicitly in the grid. (This
replaces the retired "an uncurated host emits every possible profile" default.)

### Contributed Configuration sections
Beyond Profiles, installed plugins can add their own entries to the **⚙
Configuration** menu via a `config_sections` entry in their pivot manifest —
giving a settings-oriented layer a home (an SSH layer an "SSH" entry, an MCP
layer an "MCP" entry) without owning a whole pivot. Profiles is always listed
first; contributed sections follow. Selecting one runs the plugin's own
configuration command (scoped to the current machine); selecting Profiles still
opens the profiles grid. See
[architecture.md § Picker Pivot Registry](architecture.md#picker-pivot-registry-cross-plugin).

## Auditing & testing the render (headless)

The Picker is a **deterministic renderer**: `PickerScreen.render()` composes the
whole screen (topbar, pivots, machine tabs, borders, body, footer, and any modal
overlay) into a single styled Rich `Text`, and the app takes an injected data
`source`. Given the same data, the same grid comes out — so a state can be
captured with no live terminal and no human watching:

> **Render-flow invariant — never block the event loop; open-first + spinner +
> refine.** The Picker runs on a single Textual event-loop thread. No subprocess
> (an `agent-worktrees --json` verb, `agent-dispatch`, `git`, `ssh`, a mux/session
> liveness probe) and no blocking IO may run *on* that thread — one blocking call
> freezes the whole UI (and reads as a crash). Data reads run on the `LiveLoader`'s
> background threads; actions and cross-process menu-open probes are offloaded via
> `PickerScreen._run_bg` (worker thread + Textual `call_from_thread`). A
> load-gated component (e.g. the worktree **Actions** menu) **opens immediately
> from cached state**, shows the shared **spinner** in its footer while the probe
> runs, and **refines in place** when it lands — it never waits, and no control
> ever looks inert. See
> [architecture.md](architecture.md#the-picker-render-flow----never-block-on-cross-processio-invariant).

- **Screenshot for auditing** — `worktree-manager picker screenshot <project>`
  renders the current picker headlessly and writes it out for review. `--format
  svg` (default) is a standalone screenshot with colours preserved; `--format
  text` is the plain character grid; `--format ansi` is the colour-aware grid.
  `--out FILE` writes a file (else stdout), `--live` uses the multi-machine SSH
  source.
- **Character-grid tests** — `worktree_manager.production_picker.picker_tui.capture`
  (`screen_to_text` / `screen_to_ansi` / `screen_to_svg`, and `capture()` to spin
  the app headlessly over a fixture fleet) lets tests assert *what the operator
  would see* — focus, selection, state blocks, colour-as-semantics — as a golden
  character grid. The canonical snapshots now live under
  `worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/`.

### Shareable & animated demo captures

The same capture seam produces **safe-to-publish** imagery from real fleet data:

- **Obscured render** — `worktree_manager.production_picker.picker_tui.obscure`
  turns real `list --json` dumps into a synthetic source with identifying
  particulars scrubbed (machine names -> codenames, repo/branch -> generic,
  titles -> a demo pool, PR url/number/sha and paths/summaries removed) while
  preserving the *shape* (states, sync tags, ages, dispositions) that makes it
  look authentic.
- **Animated walkthrough** — `capture_frames_async()` drives the picker through a
  scripted keyboard tour (switch pivot -> move selection -> open/close a menu)
  and returns a frame per step.
- **The tool** — `worktree-manager/scripts/picker-shot.py` packages the whole
  pipeline: gather (a
  directory of dumps, or live across the roster over SSH) -> obscure -> render ->
  rasterize to **PNG** via a headless Chromium-family browser, or `--animate` to
  a **GIF**. Example:
  `python worktree-manager/scripts/picker-shot.py --from-dir ./dumps --view all
  --out hero.png`.
  It's a maintainer/demo tool (needs a browser, plus Pillow for GIF), not shipped
  runtime.

## Keeping the list honest

The Picker reflects **live** state, not a snapshot: rows carry git-derived
state + sync tags, a staged runtime update surfaces as an "apply staged update +
restart the picker" row, and `r` refreshes (re-scanning contributed pivots).
Merged worktrees show as `FINAL` or `MERGED` (see
[worktree-lifecycle.md § FINAL vs MERGED](worktree-lifecycle.md#final-vs-merged----the-closure-descriptor-split))
and are cleared by Cleanup, not left lying as open work.

### Frame-health diagnostics

Every generated project binstub appends a `binstub_start` record to
`~/.agent-worktrees/logs/picker-launches.jsonl`. The Picker appends
`launcher_start`, `resolve_start`, `resolve_handler_start`,
`picker_dispatch_start`, `textual_app_start`, and `textual_first_refresh` as the
launch advances, all with the same `launch_id`. These always-on records provide
historical blank-window timings without enabling verbose diagnostics.

Set `AGENT_WORKTREES_PICKER_FRAME_HEALTH=1` before launching a project Picker
to add event-loop gaps of 500 ms or more to the same launch trace. The timer
callback only enqueues bounded records; a daemon writer owns filesystem I/O.
Override the diagnostic destination by setting the variable to a path, or the threshold with
`AGENT_WORKTREES_PICKER_FRAME_GAP_SECONDS`.
