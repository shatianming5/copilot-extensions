# Agent Worktrees Repos Registry

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
every shell operation below. Replace `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with
that raw path, quote it at each shell call site, and never search `PATH`.

Manage the repos registry at `~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml` — the <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
**canonical** catalog of known repositories across platforms. This
registry supersedes the legacy `~/.git-repos` file; import an existing
one with `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos migrate`.

## Repo Classes — How a Checkout Is Edited

Every repo has a management **class** that says how the multi-machine system
interacts with its local checkout. This is the single most important
field: it determines whether (and how) you may edit the repo.

| Class | Editing model | Use for |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **reference** | Read-only. Tracked only for path resolution, cloning, and indexing (VEI). **Never edited locally.** | Upstream deps, consumer repos, indexed mirrors |
| **singleton** | Editable as a **single anchor checkout**, no worktree isolation. One flow at a time. | Repos where worktrees are overkill or unsupported |
| **worktree** | Full agent-worktrees lifecycle: **concurrent-flow safe**, edits/stages/commits isolated in per-task worktrees until the final push. | Owned/contributed repos edited by multiple agent flows (e.g. `copilot-extensions`, your control-harness repo) |

**Why this matters:** multiple agent flows editing the same anchor
checkout collide on working-tree state, staging, and commits. A
**worktree**-class repo avoids this — each task gets an isolated git
worktree, and changes only converge at push time. Editing a
worktree-class repo's anchor directly is a bug.

> Legacy mapping: the old `type: project` becomes `worktree`, and
> `type: repo` becomes `reference`. Both still load.

### Class is *not* role, locus, or delegate

`class` is one of **three orthogonal axes** that describe a repo. They are easy
to conflate — a phrase like "worktree / owner / delegate" wrongly mixes all
three into one list — so keep them straight:

| Axis | Field · home | Answers | Values |
|------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **class** | `class` · repos registry (this skill) | *How is the checkout edited?* | `reference` \| `singleton` \| `worktree` |
| **role** | `role` · `related.yaml` ([`agent-worktrees-related`](../agent-worktrees-related/SKILL.md)) | *What is this repo to another repo?* | `product` \| `dependency` \| `consumer` \| `tooling` \| `docs` \| `sibling` |
| **locus + delegate** | `locus` / `delegate` · `related.yaml` | *Where does work happen, and who is handed it?* | locus `local` \| `machine:<k>` \| `codespace` \| `container`; delegate `agent-bridge` \| `agent-codespaces` \| `agent-containers` \| `none` |

The two words that most often get mistaken for classes are **not** classes:

- **"owner" / "direct-push, no PR"** is a *landing policy*, not a class. A repo
  you own is typically `class: worktree` (still edited via isolated worktrees)
  with PR mode **off**, so `finalize` pushes straight to the default branch; a
  repo you *contribute* to is the same class with PR mode **on**. Class governs
  *edit isolation*; the `pr:` config governs *how work lands* — see
  [worktree-lifecycle.md § Landing the change](../../docs/worktree-lifecycle.md#3-landing-the-change).
- **"delegate"** is the *locus/handoff* axis (`delegate.via` in `related.yaml`) —
  hand the work to another machine / CodeSpace / container's agent — orthogonal
  to how the checkout is classed.

A single repo is described by all three axes at once. Example: `copilot-extensions`
is **class** `worktree` (edit in isolated worktrees), **role** `tooling` (what it
is to a control repo), **locus** `local` + **delegate** `none` (worked in place),
under an owner / direct-push **landing policy** (no PR). "worktree", "tooling",
and "owner" are three different answers, not one field.

## Editing a Worktree-Class Repo (Collision-Free)

For repos classed **worktree** (the default for any repo you contribute
to), do **not** edit the anchor checkout. Use the agent-worktrees
lifecycle so concurrent flows stay isolated:

```bash
# One-time: adopt the repo as an agent-worktrees project.
#   `register` takes the repo PATH from your CURRENT DIRECTORY (the git root of
#   cwd -> its main checkout), so RUN IT FROM INSIDE the target repo's checkout.
#   The <name> argument is only the project LABEL -- it does NOT locate the repo,
#   so `register <name>` run from a DIFFERENT repo adopts THAT repo's path under
#   <name> (a common footgun). To adopt a repo you are not standing in, pass an
#   explicit path instead of relying on cwd:
aw='<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>'
cd <target-repo-checkout> && "$aw" register <name>   # cwd = the subject
#   …or, from anywhere, name the path explicitly:
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> register <name> --repo-dir <path>
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos add <name> <path> --class worktree       # path-first alt

# Per task: create an isolated worktree, edit there, push, finalize
#   Agents/automation: create the worktree WITHOUT launching a session. This
#   prints the worktree path; cd into it and edit in your CURRENT session.
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> create # prints id + path (add --json for a plan)
#   Interactive (human at a terminal) only: launch a fresh muxed session in a
#   new worktree. Refused without a TTY -- never use it from a tool call.
<repo> --new
# ... edit, commit inside the worktree path ...
<repo> push-changes                      # push to the remote default branch
<repo> finalize                          # validate on upstream + clean up the worktree
```

Edits, stages, and commits live in the per-task worktree and only reach
the shared remote on `push-changes`. This is what prevents two parallel
flows from clobbering each other mid-edit.

**Singleton** repos: edit the anchor directly (only one flow at a time).
**Reference** repos: never edit — read, clone, or index only.

## CLI Commands

All commands are accessed via
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos <subcommand>`:

```
repos list [--class reference|singleton|worktree] [--json]
repos find <name>
repos add <name> <path> [--class C] [--remote URL]
                        [--account LOGIN] [--default-branch B]
                        [--tags a,b] [--contributing PATH]
repos remove <name>
repos clone <remote> [--name N] [--target PATH]
repos srcroot [--set PATH] [--platform windows|wsl|linux]
repos migrate [--default-class reference|singleton|worktree]
repos status [--tag T] [--class C] [--json]
repos sync [<repo> ...] [--tag T] [--class C]
repos account [list|set <owner> <login>|unset <owner>]   # org->login map
repos account-for <owner|owner/name|reponame>            # print resolved login
repos allow-edits <repo> --reason <why> [--minutes N]    # break-glass grant
repos allow-edits --list                                 # show active grants
repos allow-edits <repo> --revoke                        # end a grant early
```

### `allow-edits` -- break-glass edit grants

Some repos are *agent-guarded*: a delegation policy (e.g. a harness's
`cross-repo-guard` hook) blocks direct edits to their checkouts so work is
routed to the repo's own in-repo agent. When a direct edit is genuinely
unavoidable -- maintaining the target agent's OWN instructions/skills, or a
direct action to unblock -- `allow-edits` records a **time-boxed, per-repo**
grant (default 10m, max 60m; `--reason` required) that the guard reads to
temporarily permit edits. The store lives at
`~/.agent-worktrees/allow-edits.json` with epoch-millisecond timestamps so a <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
JS/TS or shell hook can read it without unit ambiguity. It's a deliberate,
logged last resort -- prefer delegation (`related resolve <repo>`).

The **accounts catalog** is a sibling top-level command:

```
accounts list
accounts show <login>
accounts set <login> [--host H] [--scopes a,b] [--login-flow CMD] [--notes T]
accounts remove <login>
```

## Common Workflows

### Migrate the legacy ~/.git-repos registry

Run once per machine/environment to import an existing `~/.git-repos`
into `repos.yaml`. Adopted projects (in `projects.yaml`) are classified
as **worktree**; everything else defaults to **singleton** (override with
`--default-class`). The legacy file is left in place — remove it after
verifying.

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos migrate
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos list          # verify, then reclassify as needed
```

Reclassify any entry by re-adding it with the right class:

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos add copilot-extensions 'D:\Src\copilot-extensions' --class worktree
```

### Set up source roots

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos srcroot --set 'D:\Src' --platform windows
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos srcroot --set ~/src --platform wsl
```

### Register an existing repo

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos add my-lib 'D:\Src\my-lib' --class reference \
  --remote https://github.com/org/my-lib.git
```

### Find where a repo is checked out

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos find my-project
# → D:\Src\my-project
```

If the repo has no local path but has a remote, suggest cloning it.

### Check status / sync across repos (git hygiene)

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos status                 # branch, dirty, ahead/behind
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos sync --tag multi-machine system    # fetch + ff-merge (skips dirty)
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos sync copilot-extensions            # fast-forward just that one repo
```

`sync` only fast-forwards the default branch and **skips** any repo whose
working tree is dirty or whose checkout is on a non-default branch — it
never force-updates or creates merge commits. Naming one or more repos
(`repos sync <repo> [<repo> ...]`) narrows the sync to exactly those,
combinable with `--tag`/`--class` -- **names must come first** (positionals
before flags): `--tag`'s value runs to the next `--`-flag (to keep an
unquoted, multi-word tag like the `multi-machine system` example above
working), so a name placed after `--tag` would be swallowed into its value
instead. A named repo that isn't registered at all is reported as its own
`not registered` result. `anchor_write_guard` never blocks `git pull
--ff-only` (or a bare `git fetch`, which never mutates the working tree)
against an anchor -- `--ff-only` makes git structurally refuse instead of
ever creating a merge commit or applying a configured `pull.rebase`. A bare
`git pull` (no `--ff-only`) remains blocked like any other agent-authored
mutation, since a diverged anchor's default merge WOULD create a genuine
new local commit; `repos sync` is the always-available equivalent when
typing `--ff-only` isn't convenient.

## Data File

The registry lives at `~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml`. Full annotated example: <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
[`references/repos.yaml`](references/repos.yaml). At a glance:

```yaml
srcroot:
  windows: D:\Src
  wsl: ~/src
account_map:                       # decoupled GitHub owner/org -> gh login
  github: ThomasMichon             #   org-owned repos resolve to the right
  example-org: example-operator #   login (not the org name)
repos:
  copilot-extensions:
    class: worktree                # reference | singleton | worktree
    remote: "https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions.git"
    account: ThomasMichon          # optional; else account_map, else remote owner
    default_branch: main
    windows: D:\Src\copilot-extensions
    wsl: ~/src/copilot-extensions
```

### Schema

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `class` | `reference` \| `singleton` \| `worktree` (see above) |
| `remote` | Git remote URL |
| `account` | Preferred GitHub identity (a `gh` account login) this repo's git/gh ops run under. Optional — absent, it's resolved via `account_map` then the `github.com` remote owner; a non-GitHub/underivable remote means no account (ambient auth). See *Repo-scoped identity* below. |
| `default_branch` | Branch `status`/`sync` track (default: current) |
| `tags` | Filter tags for batch ops (`multi-machine system`, `work`, …) |
| `contributing` | Path to CONTRIBUTING.md — read before editing |
| `windows`/`wsl`/`linux` | Per-platform checkout paths |

Top-level `account_map` (GitHub **owner/org → gh login**) is the decoupled
identity layer: it maps an owner that is **not** itself a `gh` account — an org
like `github` or `example-org` — to the login that can access it. Manage it
with `repos account set/list/unset`; the identities it points at (host, scopes,
login flow) are catalogued separately in `~/.agent-worktrees/accounts.yaml` <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
(`accounts …`).

### Repo-scoped identity (multi-account)

Operating across repos under different GitHub identities (e.g. an EMU work
account vs. a personal account) otherwise forces manual `gh auth switch`.
the runtime resolves the **account from repo context** and applies it
inline, so agents never hand-switch:

- **Resolution** (`resolve_account` / `account_for_github_owner`): explicit
  `account:` → top-level `account_map[owner]` → the remote owner itself →
  none. None = today's ambient-`gh` behavior (additive, safe). The `account_map`
  step is what makes an **org-owned** repo (`github/…`, `example-org/…`)
  resolve to the correct login instead of the org name. GitHub-only in v1;
  an ADO/Gitea remote resolves no account *unless* its own registered entry
  has an explicit `account:` override, which still applies. A bare
  *registered repo name* (as opposed to an owner or `owner/name` slug)
  resolves through the registry to that entry's own `account:` first, else
  its remote owner (`resolve_slug_owner`), so it is never mistaken for a
  literal owner/account key.
- **Query primitive**: `repos account-for <owner|owner/name|reponame>` prints
  the resolved login (exit 1 if none). Other tools (e.g. **agent-codespaces**,
  to pick the `gh` account for `gh codespace …`) shell out to it rather than
  importing agent-worktrees.
- **gh/PR ops** (`create-pr`, `pr-merge`, `pr-ready`, `pr-status`, `pr-watch`,
  `pr-complete`, `pr-nudge`, label/GraphQL): the resolved account mints a token
  (`gh auth token --user <account>` → `GH_TOKEN`); an explicit
  `pr.token_command`/`pr.token_env` still wins. No global switch.
- **git push/fetch**: the account credential is injected per-invocation via
  `http.extraheader` (this tool's own commands only), with a plain-push
  retry fallback. Registration additionally **persists** a repo-local
  `credential.https://<host>` override in `.git/config` (`username` + a
  `gh auth token`-backed `helper`) once the account resolves unambiguously,
  so a plain `git fetch`/`git pull` run by anything *other* than this tool
  (an IDE, CI, an unattended maintenance task) also authenticates as the
  correct account rather than whichever `gh` account happens to be
  ambiently active. See `pin-credentials` below.

`repos list` and `related resolve` surface the resolved account (`explicit` vs
`derived`). Prefer `account_map` for a whole org; set an explicit per-repo
`account:` only for a one-off where a single repo under an owner needs a
different login.

**Clarified at registration.** When `repos add`, `repos clone`, or `register`
(adopt) would leave a repo's account resolving *only* by falling back to a
github **owner that isn't an authenticated `gh` account** (i.e. an org like
`github`/`example-org`), the flow clarifies it then and there — interactively
it lists the authenticated `gh` logins and persists your pick as an
`account_map` entry; headless it warns with the exact remedy
(`repos account set <owner> <login>`). A repo whose owner **is** a `gh` account
(a personal/EMU repo) is left silent, and nothing prompts once an
`account:`/`account_map` already resolves. (dotfiles #537)

**Backfilling the credential pin.** Repos registered before the pin existed,
or whose account only became resolvable later (a fresh `account_map` entry),
don't automatically get the `.git/config` override above. Run
`repos pin-credentials [name] [--all] [--json]` to retrofit it: omit the name
(or pass `--all`) to sweep every registered repo, or name one to restrict.
Reports one of:

- `pinned` — the override was written.
- `needs_clarify` — resolve with `repos account set <owner> <login>` first.
- `skipped` — `gh` unavailable, not a git checkout, **or** `login` is
  already the active `gh` account (the inherited default helper already
  works there; forcing this override risks a scope-limited OAuth token
  turning a working push into a 403).
- `no_path` — no local checkout on this machine.
- `not_github` / `not_registered` — non-GitHub remote / unknown repo name.
- `ssh_remote` / `not_https` — the checkout's remote is SSH, or plain
  `http://`; the pin only ever affects `credential.https://<host>` and is a
  no-op for either transport.

### Accounts catalog (`accounts.yaml`)

`~/.agent-worktrees/accounts.yaml` catalogs the gh account **identities** the <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
`account_map` points at — login, host, expected OAuth scopes, and the
(re)login flow — so a scope-preflight can tell you *which* account to fix and
*how*. Manage with `accounts list|show|set|remove`:

```
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> accounts set <gh-login> --scopes codespace,repo,workflow \
    --login-flow 'gh auth login -h github.com'
```

> **Running a `login_flow` over SSH?** `gh`/`az`/`devtunnel` device-code auth is
> interactive and polls for a minute-plus. A Windows SSH session is a **network
> logon** that (with its child process tree) is torn down on disconnect — so a
> foreground command, *or* a `Start-Process -Hidden` child, dies mid-poll and the
> code expires. Launch it under **Task Scheduler** (`schtasks /Create /Run`,
> output → a file) and poll that file over fresh SSH connections. `gh auth
> refresh` also targets the **active** account (no `-u/--user` on many builds), so
> `gh auth switch` first, then restore. Full recipe: agent-codespaces README
> (*Authenticating an account over SSH*).


## Integration Points

- **Adopt flow**: reads `srcroot` to suggest clone locations for WSL
- **WSL provision**: uses `srcroot.wsl` for clone targets
- **Worktree lifecycle**: `worktree`-class repos are adopted as
  `projects.yaml` projects; the registry is the broader catalog
- **ACP bridge**: queries the registry to find local checkouts
- **`projects.yaml`**: remains authoritative for adopted projects;
  `repos.yaml` is the superset catalog with class + hygiene metadata
