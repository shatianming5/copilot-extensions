description: >
  Manage a repo's per-project "related repos" index -- the directional,
  committed list of OTHER repos relevant to the current one, with their role,
  locus (where work happens), delegation target, and a narrative doc. Use when
  asked to link/unlink a related repo, list or show related repos, set the
  primary repo, scaffold or open a related repo's narrative, or when you are
  asked to work on another repo from here and it is not yet linked. Trigger
  phrases include:
  - 'link repo'
  - 'link a related repo'
  - 'add a reference to <repo>'
  - 'related repo'
  - 'related repos'
  - 'list related'
  - 'which repos are related'
  - 'cross-repo index'
  - 'set the primary repo'
  - 'default project repo'
  - 'related narrative'

# Agent Worktrees -- Related Repos

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
every shell operation below. Replace `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with
that raw path, quote it at each shell call site, and never search `PATH`.

A **control-plane** repo (e.g. a dotfiles/harness repo) coordinates work across
several OTHER repos. This skill manages the **directional, per-project** index
of those repos -- *from the current repo's point of view* -- committed in-repo
at `<repo>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related.yaml`, with a
plain-markdown narrative per related repo under
`<repo>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related/<name>.md`. Legacy
`.agent-worktrees/related.yaml` remains readable.

It complements (does **not** duplicate) the **global** repos registry
(`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos`,
`~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml`): related entries are <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
**keyed by global-registry names** and add only **relationship** (role,
summary, doc), **locus** (where to work), and **delegate** (how to hand off).
Checkout paths, class, and remote still resolve from the global registry --
never restate them here.

> **Role / locus / delegate here are *not* the registry `class`.** The registry's
> `class` (`reference` / `singleton` / `worktree`) is the **editing model** — a
> third, orthogonal axis. Don't collapse "worktree / owner / delegate" into one
> taxonomy: `worktree` is a class, "owner" is a landing policy, and `delegate` is
> a locus/handoff. See
> [`agent-worktrees-repos` § Class is not role, locus, or delegate](../agent-worktrees-repos/SKILL.md).

> To actually *work* on a related repo as a good citizen (honor class, locus,
> and delegation), use the **`working-cross-repo`** skill, which builds on
> `related resolve`.

## The model

Full annotated example: [`references/related.yaml`](references/related.yaml).
At a glance:

```yaml
# <repo>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related.yaml
primary: example-web                 # the default/primary related repo
related:
  example-web:
    role: product                 # product|dependency|consumer|tooling|docs|sibling
    summary: "Primary product monorepo we ship changes to."
    locus:
      preferred: codespace        # local | machine:<key> | codespace | container
      codespace: { repo: org/example-web-codespaces,
                   workspace_folder: /workspaces/example-web }   # cloud: any machine
      container: { repo: org/example-web-codespaces,
                   workspace_folder: /workspaces/example-web,
                   machines: [dev6] }                         # local fleet: dev6 only
    delegate: { via: agent-codespaces }
    plugins:
      - { source: example-web-agent@example-marketplace }
```

- **`role`** -- what the repo is to this one (free-form; common values above).
- **`locus`** -- *where work actually happens*: `local`, `machine:<key>`,
  `codespace`, or `container`; `machines:` lists the boxes a *local* checkout is
  available on (the per-machine availability the per-*platform* global registry
  can't express).
  - **`codespace:`** -- GitHub CodeSpace hints (`repo` / `machine` / `location`
    / `workspace_folder`). CodeSpaces run in the cloud, so they work from **any**
    machine.
  - **`container:`** -- a local Docker dev-container fleet (`repo` /
    `workspace_folder` + a `machines:` list scoping it to the fleet hosts). A
    container fleet is **local**, so `machines:` restricts where it can run
    (e.g. `[dev6]`). `workspace_folder` is the checkout path the venue lands in
    (often *not* the venue `repo` name).
- **`delegate.via`** -- how to hand work to the agent that owns the repo:
  `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-containers`, or `none`.
- **`plugins`** -- plugins staged into the related repo's dispatched agent.
  For CodeSpace/container venues, the dispatch path copies each plugin from the
  host's installed payload and passes the extracted destination as
  `--plugin-dir` (no marketplace fetch in the venue). Git-backed and repo-local
  directory marketplaces are both supported, but every listed source must be
  enabled and installed on the machine that dispatches the work.
- **`ownership`** -- the operator's contribution/authority posture toward the
  repo (who maintains it, who reviews it) -- **not** the AI-attribution axis
  (see `audience` below for that): `owned` (the operator wholly owns it --
  their own gh namespace, or explicitly marked), `internal` (org-internal,
  not owned -- e.g. an enterprise ADO org repo), or `external` (public/
  external, not owned). **Derived once at registration** from the operator's
  own gh account logins + the repo's remote, then treated as
  **authoritative** -- consumers read this manifest instead of
  re-inspecting live `gh` accounts. An explicit value always wins over the
  derivation, so an ADO repo the operator wholly owns is marked `owned` even
  though the ADO-host default is `internal`. `owner` records the resolving
  operator account when derivable.
- **`audience`** -- who can read what gets published to this repo: `public`
  (visible on the public internet), `internal` (org-internal -- enterprise
  ADO, internal Gitea -- visible to coworkers/org members, not the public
  internet), or `private` (not visible beyond the operator and explicitly
  invited collaborators). This is the axis the AI-attribution decision
  actually keys on, orthogonal to `ownership` above -- an operator-owned
  repo can still be `public` just as easily as a third-party repo could be
  `private`. Unlike `ownership`, this is **never derived automatically**:
  set it explicitly when it matters, since it isn't reliably inferable from
  a git remote alone. Omitted (empty) means "unclassified," and consumers
  judge the target themselves rather than silently assuming the
  disclosure-exempt `private` case. `public`/`internal`/unclassified all
  default to disclosure required; only a positively-set `private` opts out.
- **`ai_attribution`** -- an optional per-repo override of the
  `audience`-derived disclosure policy, consumed by the `ai-attribution`
  plugin: `disclose_on_open` (bool) and `disclose_on_reply` (bool), each
  defaulting to the audience-derived value when omitted. A key that *is*
  present is honored verbatim -- it can turn disclosure OFF for a case the
  operator has consciously decided doesn't need it (e.g. opening issues/PRs
  in a repo they maintain directly), or explicitly ON for a `private` repo
  that still needs it in one direction (e.g. still disclosing on replies) --
  in either direction relative to the audience-derived default; a key that's
  *absent* from the override simply stays at that default. **Trust
  boundary:** a `private` audience or a disclosure-weakening override is
  only honored from a machine override or the bound knowledge repo --
  never from the shared harness baseline (whichever repo happens to be
  the current launch/base anchor carries no positive signal that it's
  operator-controlled, so an untrusted launch repo can't suppress
  disclosure for itself *or* for any other repo it describes), and never
  from a target repo's own tracked `related.yaml` (the "repository"
  layer). Widening disclosure is never gated. This means a harness-level
  `related.yaml` cannot currently supply a `private` audience or a
  narrowing override for anything -- a known, deliberate limitation, not
  an oversight; use the machine or knowledge-repo layer for any policy
  that needs to narrow disclosure.
- **`primary`** -- the default repo (used by `related resolve` with no name).

## CLI

All commands take `[--repo PATH]` to target a specific checkout; the default is
the git repo containing the current directory.

```
related list [--role R] [--json]         List related repos (+ the primary)
related show <name> [--json]             Show one entry + global-registry context
related add <name> [opts]                Link a repo + scaffold its narrative
related remove <name>                    Unlink (leaves the narrative doc)
related doc <name>                       Print (scaffold if missing) the narrative
related doctor [--json]                  Validate entries against reality (report-first)
related primary [<name>]                 Show or set the primary
related resolve [<name>]                 How to work on it from here (see working-cross-repo)
related classify [<name>|--all] [--overwrite]   Derive ownership + persist (unset only)
related owners [--json]                  List wholly-owned targets (ownership=owned)
related --conduct                        Emit merged session-start guidance
```

`related --conduct` is the dynamic source used by the `session-conduct` hook.
It combines all configured repos from the normal config loader (committed
in-repo settings, machine-side overrides, and `config.d/` injections) with the
grafted related index (installed plugins, harness, the machine-local project
root that `get config-dir` names -- where a stateless harness's setup writes
machine-specific entries -- and the knowledge overlay, later winning). The
always-on output is intentionally bounded: registered repositories are
discovered through the active project's repository tooling; the conduct output
itself shows the directional-entry count, while
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> related list` enumerates those entries. It then gives the
cross-repo safety kernel and fully qualified `show`, `resolve`, and `doctor`
commands instead of emitting the full roster every session.

`add` options: `--role R`, `--summary S`, `--doc PATH`, `--delegate D`,
`--ownership owned|internal|external`, `--owner ACCOUNT`,
`--audience public|internal|private`,
`--locus L`, `--machines a,b`, `--primary`, `--no-scaffold`; for a codespace
locus `--cs-repo R --cs-machine M --cs-location L --cs-workspace DIR`; and for a
container locus `--container-repo R --container-workspace DIR
--container-machines a,b`. When `--ownership` is omitted, `add` derives it once
from the repo's remote + the operator's gh accounts (the only place live gh
accounts are consulted); `related classify` backfills existing entries.

## Validating the index -- `related doctor` (and how to act on it)

`related doctor` checks each entry against reality **on the current machine**:
every entry points at a validly-existing repo, names only in-system machines
(from `machines.yaml`), and has provisionable venues. It is **report-first --
it never edits `related.yaml`.** Run it after editing the index, and whenever
cross-repo resolution behaves oddly. `--json` emits `{ current_machine,
machines_yaml_available, findings: [{name, kind, severity, detail,
suggested_actions, candidate_path}] }`.

Findings and how you (the agent) resolve each **with the user**:

- **`local_repo_unregistered`** (warning, the headline) -- an entry claims a
  **local** checkout available on *this* machine, but the machine's own
  `repos.yaml` has no entry. The repo is *probably checked out but never
  registered* (or the entry is stale). **Do not delete the entry.** The doctor
  runs a best-effort hunt; if it found the checkout, `candidate_path` is set --
  offer to register it (`repos add <name> <candidate_path> --class <class>`).
  Otherwise **ask the user** which they want:
  1. **locate it** -- they point you at the path → `repos add`;
  2. **provide a URL** -- clone it, then `repos add`;
  3. **create it fresh** -- clone/scaffold, then `repos add`;
  4. **remove the entry** -- only with explicit approval (`related remove <name>`).
- **`unknown_machine`** (warning) -- a locus names a machine key absent from
  `machines.yaml`. Ask whether it's a typo (correct the key) or a real machine
  to add to `machines.yaml`.
- **`codespace_missing_repo` / `container_missing_repo`** (error) -- a venue has
  no `repo` to provision from. Ask for the vessel repo and set it.
- **`crossmachine_unverifiable`** (info) -- a local entry that targets *other*
  machines only; its local registration can't be checked from here. Not a
  defect -- run `related doctor` **on that machine** to verify it there.
- **`empty_locus`** (info) -- no locus; ask where work on it happens and set one.

**Never remove or rewrite an entry on your own** -- a missing registration is
almost always the user forgetting to point the harness at an existing checkout,
not a bad entry. Surface the finding, propose the concrete fix, and let the user
choose; only remove with their approval.

## When to link a repo

- **Explicit** -- the user asks to "link", "add a related repo", "track repo X
  here". Run `related add X ...`.
- **Implicit** -- you are asked to make a change in repo **B** from repo **A**,
  and **B is not yet in A's `related.yaml`**. Offer to link it first
  (`related add B`), so the relationship and its narrative are captured for next
  time, then proceed via `working-cross-repo`.

A linked name should exist in the **global** registry (`repos add <name> ...`);
`related add` warns when it doesn't but still records the link.

## Narrative docs

`related add` scaffolds `related/<name>.md` -- a short narrative *from this
repo's POV*: why the repo matters here, how to make a change, and its rules.
The template bakes in the **never-hardcode-a-path** rule (resolve checkouts with
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> repos find <name>`). Fill in the TODO sections; the docs are
committed alongside `related.yaml`.

## Common workflows

```bash
# Link the product repo, preferred via a CodeSpace, and make it primary
related add example-web --role product --primary \
  --locus codespace --cs-repo org/example-web-codespaces \
  --cs-machine largePremiumLinux256gb --cs-location EastUs \
  --delegate agent-codespaces

# Link a tooling repo that only lives on some machines
related add copilot-extensions --role tooling \
  --locus machine:dev6 --machines dev6,cloud1 --delegate agent-bridge

related list                 # review the index + the primary
related show example-web        # entry + [class] path remote from the registry
related doc example-web         # open/scaffold the narrative to fill in
```
