  Multi-agent git collaboration on a worktree: pull a worktree forward onto an
  updated default branch and build on top of a just-merged PR, share a durable
  feature branch across several agents, and ff-merge a delegate's slice into that
  feature branch -- with a clear boundary between git that must go through the
  plugin's worktree wrappers and the everyday git you run directly. This is the
  "branches" executor binding for the efforts planning system: an effort
  coordinating multiple agents over one feature branch is driven from here. Use
  whenever you continue work after a PR merges, coordinate more than one agent
  on a branch, or decide whether a git command is safe to run raw. Trigger
  phrases include:
  - 'pull forward'
  - 'build on top of the merged PR'
  - 'sync the worktree to master'
  - 'shared feature branch'
  - 'multi-agent branch'
  - 'merge my slice into the feature branch'
  - 'can I just run git'
  - 'is it safe to git push'
  - 'coordinate agents on one branch'
  - 'host-only PR'

# Git Collaboration

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
every worktree helper below. Replace `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with
that raw path, quote it at each shell call site, and never search `PATH`.

This skill covers the **git collaboration flows** that sit *below* the high-level
sign-off flow (`push-changes` / `create-pr` / `finalize`, owned by the
**`worktree`** skill) and *above* raw git. Three flows live here:

1. **Pull forward / build on top** -- after a PR merges, advance the worktree
   onto the updated default branch and keep working on top of it.
2. **Shared feature branch** -- a durable branch several agents commit to, with
   one host that owns PRs.
3. **The boundary** -- which git you should just run directly, and which steps
   have a turn-key helper.

**The flows are the point; the commands are turn-key helpers.** Each
payload-local `git ...` verb just wraps a short git sequence you *could* run by
hand -- it exists so the common path is one safe step that can't silently break a
shared invariant. Reach for the helper when a flow below calls for it; otherwise
use plain git.

> **Don't fully wrap git.** Wrapping every git command destroys the
> intuitiveness of the tool everyone already knows. The helpers exist *only* for
> the steps that protect a shared invariant raw git would silently break.
> Everything else is plain git -- and this skill says so explicitly, so you don't
> reach for a helper that isn't needed.

## The boundary -- plain git vs. turn-key helper vs. forbidden

| Operation | Do it via | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch -v` | **plain git** | read-only inspection; no shared state |
| `add`, `commit`, `restore`, local `switch`, `rebase -i` **on your own worktree branch** | **plain git** | local history; disposable until it lands |
| `stash` | **avoid -- see below** | the stash stack is **shared across every worktree of the same clone**, not scoped to yours |
| `fetch` | **plain git** | read-only; updates remote-tracking refs only |
| Advance the worktree onto the merged default ("pull forward") | helper: `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git sync` | wraps fetch + rebase; drops squash-merged commits without losing local work |
| Create / update / push a **shared** feature branch | helper: `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git feature-branch ...` | wraps create + ff + push; a real remote branch many agents build on |
| Merge a delegate's slice into the shared feature branch | helper: `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git merge-to-feature ...` | wraps rebase + ff + push; must be **ff-only** (no two-parent nodes) |
| Push to the remote **default** branch / open a PR | flow: `push-changes` * `create-pr` * `finalize` | the lifecycle/sign-off flow (see the `worktree` skill) |
| Bare `git push` of a `worktree/*` branch | **forbidden** | `worktree/*` refs must never reach the remote |
| Manual merge to the default branch | **forbidden** | breaks linear, one-commit-per-worktree history -- use `finalize` |
| A **delegate** opening or merging a **PR** | **forbidden** | only the **host** opens PRs from the shared branch (below) |
| Force-push of shared history (default or shared feature branch) | **forbidden** | rewrites history other agents have built on |

Rule of thumb: **if a parser, a remote, or another agent will consume the
result, reach for the helper; if only you and your local branch see it, just run
git.** The helper never does anything you couldn't do by hand -- it just does the
invariant-bearing steps the same way every time.

## Pull forward -- build on top of a merged PR

After a PR merges (especially a **squash** merge), the worktree branch still
carries the now-upstreamed commits. To keep working, advance onto the new
default and stack new work on top -- **do not** start a fresh worktree.

**This is the standard, automatic-by-convention move the moment a PR lands** --
not an optional cleanup. As soon as you confirm the merge, pull forward.

**`pr-status` confirms the merge and tells you to do it.**
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> pr-status` reconciles the active PR against
the provider, so a PR merged
externally (e.g. via the `auto-merge` label) reports `state: merged` rather than
a stale `open`. When it has landed and the worktree is not yet on top of the
updated default branch, it flags `pull_forward_recommended: true` with a
`next_action`. Treat that flag as a directive.

The flow is plain git you could run by hand:

```
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<default>     # the manual flow
```

The turn-key helper does exactly that, plus the guards:

```
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git sync          # the helper
```

`sync` fetches the remote and rebases the worktree branch onto
`<remote>/<default>`, **dropping commits that were squash-merged upstream**
(they reappear as a single commit on the default branch; git skips them as
already-applied) while preserving any genuinely-new local commits. It runs
**mid-flight** -- it does *not* finalize, prune, or push. A dirty tree or a true
rebase conflict stops it with a clear message instead of guessing; on a conflict
the rebase auto-aborts so the branch is left untouched -- resolve by hand, then
re-run. Because the PR squashed your work into one commit, conflicts are
uncommon.

This is the **review-gate continuation** for efforts: submit the effort PR ->
it's reviewed + merged -> confirm via `pr-status` -> `git sync` -> build Phase
work on top.

## Safe rebase in a high-velocity repo: backup branch, then cherry-pick

`git sync`'s auto-abort-on-conflict keeps a *simple* rebase safe. But in a repo
with many concurrent contributors -- commits (and version-bump races) landing
on the default branch faster than you can rebase and push -- a rebase can
still turn genuinely messy: real conflicts across several of your own commits,
or the default branch moving again mid-resolution. Reaching for `git stash` to
"get out of the way" while you sort it out is the wrong reflex here (see
below); the durable-safe move instead is:

1. **Commit everything first.** Nothing should be sitting only in the working
   tree or a stash -- a rebase you abort partway through must never cost you
   uncommitted work.
2. **Tag a local backup branch** at your current tip before touching the
   rebase: `git branch backup/<slug>`. Costs nothing, and it's your unconditional
   fallback if the rebase goes sideways.
3. **Rebase (or attempt the merge) against a freshly fetched default branch**,
   resolving conflicts as they come.
4. **If it gets messy -- multiple conflicting commits, or the base moved again
   mid-resolution -- stop resolving in place.** Reset to the backup
   (`git reset --hard backup/<slug>`), re-fetch, and
   `git cherry-pick <your-commit(s)>` onto the fresh base instead. Cherry-pick
   replays your own commits one at a time onto wherever the default branch
   actually is *right now*, which is usually far less error-prone than
   untangling an in-progress rebase's conflict markers across several commits.
5. Delete the backup branch once your work is confirmed on the remote
   (`git branch -D backup/<slug>`) -- it's scaffolding, not a permanent ref.

### When the base has drifted *and* your target files were split upstream: squash first, then rebase

**Applies only to an owned, private PR branch (your own `worktree/*` -> `pr/*`
flow) -- never to a shared feature branch.** The squash + force-push below
rewrites history, which the boundary table above forbids on any branch other
agents build on; on a shared feature branch, use `git merge-to-feature`'s
ff-only flow instead and skip this whole technique.

The cherry-pick recovery above assumes your own commits still apply cleanly
one at a time onto the fresh base. That assumption breaks down when a PR sits
open long enough (tens to hundreds of commits behind) *and* one of this
repo's own campaigns (its module-componentization-discipline effort, enforced
by `tools/check-module-size.py`) has meanwhile split the exact file your PR
touches into two or more successors. A multi-commit rebase or a per-commit
cherry-pick then has to resolve the *same* relocation conflict repeatedly --
once per commit -- turning a single real change (a file moved) into an
enormous, largely spurious conflict fight that obscures the one genuine
decision buried in it.

The fix is to collapse the noise before touching the moved file at all:

1. **Squash your PR's commits into one, against its *original* merge-base**
   (not the current tip): tag a backup ref first (`git branch
   backup/<slug>-presquash`), then `git reset --soft <original-merge-base>`
   and a single `git commit` capturing the whole diff. This is a size
   reduction, not a rebase -- it never touches the target branch, so do it
   before fetching anything new.
2. **Fetch and rebase that single squashed commit onto the current target
   tip.** Now there is exactly one conflict to resolve per moved file, not
   one per original commit -- because there is only one commit left.
3. **Resolve the relocation conflict once**, understanding it as "this hunk
   now belongs in `new_module_a.py` instead of `old_module.py`" rather than
   fighting the rebase machinery's per-commit view of the same move.
4. Continue as a normal single-commit rebase from here (`git rebase
   --continue`), then force-push with lease **once the result is confirmed
   correct locally** -- this genuinely rewrites *your own* published PR
   branch's history down to one commit (the same single-commit-per-PR
   invariant this repo's worktree/PR flow already expects, see the
   `worktree` skill's own reference doc). Keep the `backup/<slug>-presquash`
   ref around until that push lands and CI picks it up; only delete it once
   the rewritten branch is confirmed on the remote.

This is a variant of the same problem class as the backup-branch +
cherry-pick technique above (many concurrent commits against a moving base),
with a different failure mode: a file *relocation*, not just conflicting
hunks within an unmoved file. Reach for cherry-pick when your own commits are
still individually clean against the new base; reach for squash-first when
the base has reorganized the very files you touched -- and, either way, only
on a branch that is yours alone to rewrite.

### `git stash` is a shared stack across every worktree of one clone -- don't reach for it here

`git stash` is **not** scoped to the worktree you run it in: worktrees of the
same repository share one `.git` directory, and the stash stack lives there,
visible and poppable from *any* of them. A bare `git stash` / `git stash pop`
during a rebase can silently interact with another agent's or another
session's stash entry -- popping someone else's WIP into your tree, or (worse)
resolving *their* conflicts and dropping *their* entry when you didn't mean to
touch it at all.

If you must set work aside momentarily, prefer a real commit on a scratch
branch (`git commit -m wip` on `backup/<slug>` from step 2 above) over
`git stash` -- it's exactly as disposable, but it can never collide with
another worktree's stash entry. If you do end up needing to inspect the stash
list for any reason, treat every entry that isn't unambiguously the one you
just created as **someone else's** -- `git stash list` before and after any
stash operation, and never run a bare `pop`/`drop`/`apply` unless you've
confirmed `stash@{0}`'s message is yours.

## Iterating on an open PR (open it as a draft)

Open a PR as a **draft** when you want to iterate on it — with the PR visible for
a shareable URL or ongoing pushes — before inviting review, so the fast
auto-merge path can't land it while you are still working:

```
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> create-pr --draft
# ...address feedback locally...
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> push-changes
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> pr-ready
```

`create-pr --draft` opens the PR in the provider's native draft state (a `WIP:`
title on the multi-machine system's Gitea). The AI reviewer **skips draft / WIP /
`wip`-labelled PRs**, so it does not review while you iterate. `pr-ready` moves
the PR **out of draft** (draft → ready-for-review), which fires the
`ready_for_review` event the reviewer reviews on. `pr-ready` grants **no merge
consent** — that stays a separate post-approval step (`pr-merge`). (`--hold` is a
deprecated alias for `--draft`; a legacy PR still carrying a `do-not-merge` label
is released by `pr-ready` for backward-compat.)

## Shared feature branch -- many agents, one branch

When several agents collaborate on one effort over a single branch:

> **"Agent" here means an agent-bridge agent, not a Copilot sub-agent.** Multi-
> agent coordination in this skill is **always** via **agent-bridge** -- each
> delegate is a *separate Copilot CLI session* (local or over SSH) with **its own
> worktree** that can commit, push, and ff-merge on the shared branch. Copilot's
> in-process sub-agents (the Task tool) are **not** delegates here: they share the
> host's context, have no worktree or branch of their own, and cannot participate
> in a shared-branch handoff. If a "delegate" can't `git commit` in its own
> checkout, it's the wrong mechanism -- dispatch through agent-bridge.

1. **Host** drafts the effort and gets it reviewed/approved (the effort PR).
2. **Host** creates and pushes the shared feature branch:
   ```
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git feature-branch <name> --push
   ```
3. Each **delegate** syncs to the branch, completes its assigned section, commits
   on the branch, writes back its slice of the effort README, then ff-merges its
   work into the shared branch:
   ```
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git feature-branch <name> --sync   # pull the branch forward
   # ...do the work, commit...
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> git merge-to-feature <name>        # ff-only handoff
   ```
4. **Host** syncs forward from its side as delegates land slices, and -- when
   coordination is done -- ensures its local branch matches the shared branch and
   **submits the PR(s)**.

### Host-only PRs

**Only the host opens PRs** for a shared feature branch. Delegates **do**
ff-push their slices to the shared branch (that is the handoff -- `merge-to-feature`
ff-pushes by default, so the host can sync forward and see the work). What a
delegate must never do is **open or merge a PR** from the shared branch, or
**force-push** it. One PR owner -- the host -- keeps review and merge coherent;
many delegates fast-forward the branch underneath it.

### When you don't need a shared branch

If the work is **well-componentized** and each piece leaves the default branch
green on its own, skip the shared branch: let each delegate use its own worktree
and open its **own** PR. The host watches remote PR state to sequence
follow-ups. Use a shared feature branch only when the slices are interdependent
and must integrate before any of them can merge.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`worktree`** -- the high-level lifecycle (`push-changes` / `create-pr` /
  `finalize`) and push policy. This skill is the layer beneath it; the boundary
  table above reconciles the two.
- **`planning-efforts`** -- efforts bind their **"branches" participant** to this
  skill. Multi-agent coordination over a feature branch is planned and journaled
  in the effort README's `## Coordination` section; the mechanics live here.
- **`agent-bridge`** -- how the host dispatches a slice to a delegate agent, and
  **the only** multi-agent coordination mechanism this skill uses. A delegate is
  an agent-bridge session with its own worktree -- never a Copilot in-process
  sub-agent. This skill owns the git; agent-bridge owns the conversation.
