# Identifying a PR's Source Worktree (PR attribution & codenames)

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
every direct runtime operation below. Replace
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with that path and never search `PATH`.
Substitute the raw path and quote it at each shell call site.

This doc is written for the reader who is **not** the PR's author -- a
maintainer or reviewer who has found a PR that looks stalled, unfamiliar, or
abandoned and needs to trace it back to the worktree/machine that opened it.
If you're the author who already knows this worktree opened the PR and just
wants to resume it, see [pr-workflow.md](pr-workflow.md)'s `create-pr`
section instead -- this doc covers the same mechanism from the other side.

## What the marker looks like

`create-pr` can embed a hidden HTML-comment marker in the PR body (and
refresh it as a managed comment on every re-push), controlled by the
repo's `pr.source_attribution` config key. Its shape depends on the mode:

- **`"codename"` (default, codename-attribution-by-default).**
  ```html
  <!-- agent-worktrees:source codename=<name> -->
  ```
  A public-safe marker carrying **only** the worktree's assigned codename --
  a random label with no decodable meaning on its own. This is the marker
  you'll actually encounter on almost every repo, since it's the default.
- **`true` (raw marker, closed-circuit repos only).** Embeds the full raw
  worktree id, machine name, session id, and head SHA directly. Never used
  on a public repo.
- **`false` (anonymous opt-out).** No marker at all -- if you don't find one,
  either the repo opted out, or the PR predates attribution being enabled.
  There's no way to trace it after the fact; ask the author directly.

If the PR has been re-pushed since it opened, prefer the **newest** marker --
check managed PR comments as well as the initial body; a later push's
comment supersedes the original body's marker.

## Resolving a codename back to its worktree

```bash
<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> resolve --codename <name> --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` reports what would be resolved without launching anything --
use it first when you're just investigating, not resuming. Drop it (or use
`embody --codename <name>` for a detached agent session) once you're ready
to actually open the worktree.

Resolution order:

1. **Local first.** The codename is looked up in this machine's own
   tracking store. If it's a match, you're done -- the command resolves (or
   launches) directly.
2. **Cross-machine SSH scan (Phase 3), automatic.** If no local match,
   `resolve`/`embody` automatically asks every other known, SSH-reachable
   machine whether its own tracking store recognizes that codename.

**What "fails closed" means in practice:** a match found on a *different*
machine is never auto-launched remotely. Instead the command reports which
machine and worktree id own that codename, so you know where to look --
resuming from there means SSHing to that machine directly (a future
inter-agent dispatch mechanism may automate this further). This is
deliberate: a cross-machine resolve should never silently open a live
session on a machine you didn't expect.

## When there's no marker at all

- Confirm the repo actually has `pr.source_attribution` configured and not
  set to `false` -- run `<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> attribution-audit`
  against the repo to check its configuration and branch-name-leak
  exposure.
- A PR opened before attribution was enabled on this repo, or opened through
  a manual (non-`create-pr`) push, will have no marker -- there's nothing to
  resolve mechanically; ask the PR's author, or check the branch name for
  hints (though a public-safe `head_pattern` should not leak identifiers
  either).
- A marker that fails to resolve anywhere (no local match, no cross-machine
  match) usually means the source worktree/machine was since cleaned up,
  decommissioned, or is currently unreachable over SSH -- not that the
  marker itself is malformed.

## Accepted tradeoff -- read this before treating a codename as secret

A codename is **informationless-by-decoding, not unlinkable**. The marker
itself carries no facility topology, but the *same* codename recurring
across multiple PRs from the same worktree is still a correlatable signal to
an outside observer watching that repo's PR history. This is an accepted,
deliberate tradeoff (see `docs/architecture.md`'s *PR Attribution &
Codenames* section) -- it buys stalled-PR traceability without publishing
raw identifiers, but it is not an anonymity guarantee.
