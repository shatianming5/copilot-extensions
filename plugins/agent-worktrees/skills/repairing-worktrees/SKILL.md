  Diagnose and repair worktree/session health via the agent-worktrees `doctor`
  command (corrupt records, empty registries, stale status, orphaned session
  shells, cwd/path misalignment), and safely clean up / reap / close out
  worktrees without reaping a live session. Use when asked to:
  - 'repair worktrees' / 'repair sessions'
  - 'worktree / session doctor'
  - 'fix corrupt tracking records'
  - 'clean up empty sessions'
  - 'clean up / organize / backfill worktrees'
  - 'backfill worktree status' / 'backfill sessions'
  - 'recover worktrees' / 'orphaned worktree session'
  - 'why is a worktree showing 0 turns' / 'picker shows wrong session'
  - 'copilot -p stole the worktree head' / 'subprocess became head session'
  - 'head points to a pre-handoff session'
  - 'worktree shows active but only offers Resume'
  For pruning worktree *directories* use `gc`/`cleanup`; for orphaned mux tabs
  use `reap-sessions`. Covers record + session-state health and liveness-safe
  cleanup.

# Repairing worktrees & sessions

Use the exact `argv[0]` from the agent-worktrees session command catalog for
every direct runtime operation below. Replace
`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]>` with that raw path, quote it at each shell
call site, and never search `PATH`. Cross-plugin
`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]>` examples use that plugin's exact catalog
path under the same rule.
Project-binstub examples remain project entry points.

`<agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> doctor` is the single repeatable primitive for worktree/session
health. It is **per-project** (run it through each project's binstub, e.g.
`dotfiles worktrees doctor`, `test-chamber worktrees doctor`) and **read-only by default**.

## What it checks/repairs

1. **Tracking-record integrity** — records that fail to parse (e.g. an
   unquoted `title:` with a `:` from before the serializer quoted titles) are
   silently skipped by the picker; `--fix` re-quotes them so they load again.
2. **Registry + title backfill** — empty `sessions:` registries and missing
   titles are filled from cwd-matched session-state (wraps `backfill-sessions`).
3. **Stale status** — `status: active` with a `completed_at` set → `complete`.
4. **Empty session-state GC** — 0-user-message session shells (aborted starts /
   pre-fix cross-cwd resumes) are removed with their orphaned `session-store.db`
   rows. **Destructive**, so gated behind `--gc-sessions` and guarded by
   age / lock / current-session / registered-session.
5. **Alignment audit** (report-only) — session-less worktrees whose
   `parent_session` cwd differs from their own path.

## Procedure

1. **Report first** (safe, no writes), for each project you manage:
   ```
   <project> worktrees doctor            # e.g. dotfiles worktrees doctor
   <project> worktrees doctor --json     # machine-readable
   ```
2. **Apply non-destructive repairs** (integrity, backfill, stale status):
   ```
   <project> worktrees doctor --fix
   ```
3. **Also GC empty session shells** (destructive; only after reviewing the
   report count):
   ```
   <project> worktrees doctor --fix --gc-sessions
   ```

Run it per project (`dotfiles`, `test-chamber`, …) — the command scopes to the
current project's tracking store; the Copilot session-state/store it cleans is
shared across projects, so the guards (current + registered session ids) protect
live work regardless of which project you invoke it from. For a machine-wide
sweep, enumerate every adopted project first; a clean report from the project
you happen to be standing in says nothing about sibling project registries.

## Cross-machine transcript investigation from a four-character suffix

When an operator supplies short values such as `0541`, `96ff`, or `6659`, those
are normally the worktree ids' four-character **display suffixes**, not Copilot
session ids. Resolve them through agent-worktrees before inspecting transcript
state:

1. Enumerate the target project's worktrees over its canonical SSH alias:
   ```
   ssh <machine-alias> "<project> worktrees list --json"
   ```
   For example: `ssh <machine-alias> "dotfiles worktrees list --json"`.
   Select the unique full `id` ending in the supplied suffix. Do not guess the
   checkout root or use a directory listing as the worktree registry.
2. Enumerate registered sessions using the **full** worktree id:
   ```
   ssh <machine-alias> "<project> worktrees list-sessions --worktree <full-worktree-id> --json"
   ```
   A four-character suffix is a human handle; follow-up commands do not
   uniformly accept it, and it may be ambiguous.
3. Start with the structured transcript:
   ```
   ssh <machine-alias> "<project> worktrees session-transcript <session-id> --json"
   ```
4. Only if event-level evidence is required, inspect the exact resolved
   session(s) under `~/.copilot/session-state/<session-id>/events.jsonl`, or
   query `~/.copilot/session-store.db` by exact session id / resolved worktree
   cwd. Keep queries read-only and bounded. Do not recursively scan every
   session-state directory after the worktree and session ids are known.

This order keeps the project tracking records authoritative, handles legacy or
nonstandard worktree roots, and prevents incidental mentions in unrelated
transcripts from being mistaken for the session being investigated.

## "0 turns" / picker-shows-wrong-session — classify before you "recover"

`doctor` backfill (`backfill-sessions`) only ever fills **empty** registries
(`sessions:` is `None`/`[]`) — by design, the single sanctioned session-state
sweep. So a worktree can still read **0 turns** (or the picker can show the wrong
session) for reasons `doctor` will *not* touch. Before concluding "work was
lost," classify the worktree into one of these — the fix is different for each,
and **most 0-turn worktrees are not lost work.** There is **no Copilot
session-state garbage collection** (Copilot never auto-deletes transcripts; only
`doctor --gc-sessions`, run by hand, removes *zero-turn shells*) — so a missing
transcript is almost always one of these classes, not a deletion.

**A. Empty registry, real session on disk → `doctor --fix` (backfill).**
The normal case. `backfill-sessions` links the cwd-matched session. Nothing
manual needed.

**B. Placeholder / partial registry blocks backfill → `register-session` +
`link-succession`.** If the registry is **non-empty but wrong** — e.g. it holds
a *synthetic* head (a `diag-test-*`, a launch stub, a hand-seeded id) while the
worktree's **real** session sits unregistered on disk — backfill **skips it**
(registry isn't empty) and the picker resolves `resolved_head_session` to the
bogus id, which has no on-disk turns → **0 turns, forever.** Recover by
registering the real session and promoting it over the placeholder:
   ```
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> register-session --cwd <worktree-path> --session-id <real-id>
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> link-succession --worktree <id> \
       --predecessor <placeholder-id> --successor <real-id> \
       --predecessor-state concluded          # retire the placeholder, promote the real head
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> list-sessions --worktree <id>   # verify: real session is head, turns > 0
   ```
   (`register-session` resolves the project from `--cwd`; pass the target
   worktree's path when running from a *different* worktree.)

**C. Multi-session worktree with orphaned extra sessions → `register-session`
each, then set the true head.** A worktree with a *non-empty* registry can still
have **additional** real on-disk sessions that never got registered (again,
backfill skips non-empty registries). Register each missing session, then, if the
chronologically-latest one should be head, promote it:
   ```
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> register-session --cwd <worktree-path> --session-id <missing-id>   # repeat, oldest→newest
   <agent-worktrees catalog argv[0]> link-succession --worktree <id> \
       --predecessor <old-head> --successor <newest-id> --predecessor-state handed-off
   ```
   `register-session` appends and may stamp the *first* newly-registered session
   as head; `resolved_head_session` otherwise takes the newest **non-concluded**
   entry by list order — so use `link-succession` to assert the head you actually
   want rather than relying on registration order.

**D. Parent-spawned PR vessel → correctly empty; do NOT "recover".** A
`finalized` worktree with `sessions: []`, a **`parent_session`** naming a session
in a *different* worktree, and a **merged PR** was created **programmatically**
(`create` / `run`) by that parent session purely to carry a branch/commit/PR — no
interactive Copilot ever ran *inside* it, so **0 turns is correct** and its work
lives in the parent. This is exactly the `doctor` **alignment audit** (report-only
item 5). Registering the parent session here would **double-count** it (its cwd is
the parent's worktree) — leave the `parent_session` field as the lineage record.

**E. Genuinely no local transcript.** Rare, but confirm B–D don't apply before
declaring it. `session_turns` in the record is only a **picker render-cache** — it
self-heals to the real count on the next populate, so a stale `session_turns: 0`
on a *correctly-registered* worktree is cosmetic, not lost work.

**F. Foreign-cwd subprocess registered as this worktree's session → remove the
registration, not the transcript.** A nested command such as `copilot -p ...`
can start while its parent process is associated with a worktree. On affected
versions, the nested session's `sessionStart` contribution can be registered on
the parent's worktree even though the nested session's own cwd is elsewhere.
If it is then asserted as head, the picker follows a one-shot probe or fixture
instead of the real agent.

Diagnose this from structured fields, not names or turn counts:

1. Run `<project> worktrees list --json --fresh --all` and retain each row's
   worktree `id` + `path`.
2. Run `<project> worktrees list-sessions --worktree <full-id> --json`.
3. Compare **every registered session's `cwd`** with the worktree `path`
   (normalized, case-insensitive on Windows). A mismatch is a foreign
   registration. A one-turn probe whose cwd correctly equals the worktree is
   not this class.
4. Preserve the session-state directory and transcript. The defect is the
   worktree registration, not the session's existence.

Do **not** merely rewrite the head cache. The resident reconciliation loop may
still hold the old protected head in memory and briefly reassert it after the
first repair. Remove every foreign registration from the worktree through the
version's supported repair surface, allow one complete reconciliation pass,
then assert the real head and verify again after a fresh population pass.

Until [#1553](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/1553)
provides a supported unregister/repair verb, stop after collecting the evidence
and upgrade or escalate the repair. `deregister-session` only records the end of
an activation; it does **not** remove a session from the worktree registry.
Never hand-edit tracking YAML or call package internals to route around the
Single-Writer Contract.

**G. Head stayed on a pre-handoff session → reconstruct the actual relay.**
Legacy records may contain a later takeover session (its first user turn names
the handoff) without the predecessor/successor edge or head transition that
would promote it. Start from the registered sessions and exact structured
transcripts, then follow explicit successor links and handoff takeover prompts
to the final real session. Do not choose by timestamp alone: test probes and
failed successor shells can be newer than the authoritative agent. A handoff
whose successor never became usable leaves the predecessor authoritative.

**Why class G happens at all (root cause, not just symptom).**
`register_session` (the `sessionStart` hook) only *initializes* a worktree's
head when it has none; by design it **never moves an existing active head**
once one is set (see `docs/architecture.md` § *Current session, conclusion,
and succession*). Moving the head normally requires a session to claim its
*exact* pending handoff token via `bind-session --handoff-token <token>` /
`link-succession`. So a worktree drifts into class G whenever a later session
starts in the same directory **without** claiming that token — an informal
resume, a bare interactive restart, or `embody` with no seed — and just does
real work. Nothing in the ordinary path ever re-points the head afterward:
`doctor`'s `session_head_mismatch` scan (`#3307`) detects the resulting
divergence by diffing the registered head against the session most-recently
touched on disk, but it is **report-only** — it does not auto-repair, and
nothing warns at the moment that actually matters (resume time). Expect this
class to recur in bursts across many worktrees whenever informal resumes are
common; `handoffs[]` entries stuck at `state: "pending"` with `successor:
null` are the tell that a handoff was opened but never claimed by whatever
session actually continued the work. Recovery is exactly the `link-succession`
call above — promote the real last-working session over the stale head — but
this is presently a **manual, after-the-fact fix**, not something the engine
prevents. Tracked upstream: an architecture-level fix (`sessionStart` itself
staying authoritative for "the most recent legitimately-started session," with
non-front-door starters such as a bare `copilot -p` invocation or a native
sub-agent's own `sessionStart` firing guarded out of claiming head, and a
resume-time discrepancy warning instead of a silent divergence) is proposed on
[#3716](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/3716) — read
that issue before assuming this is a one-off bug in the local install; it
generalizes past `embody` to any informal resume. Class **F**'s foreign-cwd
registration bug has the same "no engine guard yet" shape — see `#1553` above.

**Update: the `/consume-handoff` variant of this gap is now fixed at the
source, not just repaired after the fact.** `context-handoff`'s
`consumeFileHandoff`/`consumeDispatchHandoffTask` (the functions behind both
the CLI `consume` verb and the `consume_handoff` MCP tool) previously did
nothing to move the worktree's head after a successful consumption — they
only updated `context-handoff`'s own session-state/task bookkeeping. Since a
manually-pasted handoff seed never opens an entry in agent-worktrees' own
`handoffs[]` ledger (that only happens on the `mode: auto` live-cutover path),
the successor session's `sessionStart` had no token to link against either,
so the head stuck on the predecessor **permanently** — not just until the
next repair pass. Both consume functions now call `link-succession` as a
best-effort backstop immediately after a confirmed consumption, promoting the
consuming session over whatever the worktree's registered head currently is
(a no-op if it's already correct, and never fails the consume result if the
CLI call itself fails). This closes the reproducible case reported as
"pasting the handoff seed and running `/consume-handoff` still resumes into
the old session every time." The broader `sessionStart`-level architecture
proposal in #3716 (a universal, engine-level backstop for *every* start path,
not just the sanctioned consume path) remains open.

### Verify which class you're in — cheap structured signals first

Work **cheap → expensive**; most cases resolve without ever touching the
state root:

1. **The record itself (free).** `parent_session` + `sessions: []` + a merged PR
   ⇒ class **D** (parent-spawned vessel), decided from the YAML alone. `doctor`'s
   **alignment audit** (report-only item 5) already surfaces these.
2. **`list-sessions` / `head-session` (registry, O(this worktree)).** Shows the
   registered sessions and which id `resolved_head_session` picks — a synthetic /
   dead head with real siblings on disk points at class **B/C**. Compare the
   session cwd with the worktree path here as the class **F** check.
3. **The session-store index, keyed by cwd (one indexed query).** Query the
   Copilot session store's index for sessions whose `cwd` is the worktree path,
   rather than walking the filesystem — this finds a real in-worktree session
   without any directory iteration.

### Before promoting a class-G candidate, confirm it isn't itself an unconsumed handoff seed

A session with the highest `created_at`/most turns is the right promotion
target *only if it actually did work* — not merely if it exists. A session
that only ever received the handoff/continuation-brief prompt and never
progressed (0-1 turns, `ended_at_marker: null`) is not a legitimate successor;
promoting it just moves the same problem one hop later. Before running
`link-succession`, pull that candidate's first and last user-turn content
(`<project> worktrees session-transcript <id> --json`, or grep its
`user.message` events if the transcript is large) and confirm both: (a) the
**first** turn is the expected handoff seed (`Task: ... | Resume:
/consume-handoff ... | Recovery: context-handoff ...`) — proving it really is
a successor and not an unrelated session that happens to share the cwd — and
(b) the **last** turn shows real closing activity (e.g. "finalize worktree",
a concrete result), not the seed still sitting unanswered. A candidate with
only the seed and nothing after it means the true successor is a *later*
session still on the worktree, or a class-E "no local transcript" gap.

### A terminal managed worktree's stale, never-registered handoff successor

`register-session`/`status --resolved` refuse on a terminal (`kind` managed,
status finalized/complete/completed) worktree by design -- that gate protects
every live session's sessionStart-hook-critical path from an accidental new
activation on a worktree that's already done -- and `link-succession` requires
the successor to already be a tracked `SessionEntry`. When a real successor
consumed a `pending` handoff and did real work but crashed/raced before its
own registration step ran, neither path applies, and `pending_handoffs`/
`resolved_head_session` stay wedged forever, permanently blocking gc's
managed-worktree recheck. **Never hand-edit the tracking YAML** to route
around this. Use `resolve-handoff-successor <worktree-id> --token <token>
--successor <session-id>` instead: it applies the identical class-G evidence
bar above (cwd match, a real handoff-seed first turn, real turns beyond it,
not still live) before retroactively registering the successor, linking the
handoff, and concluding it so the record lands back in the terminal shape gc
expects.

### Verify head repair survives reconciliation

An immediate successful write is not enough when a resident reconciler may have
captured the old head before the repair:

1. Run `<project> worktrees head-session --worktree-id <id> --json`.
2. Force the normal read path with
   `<project> worktrees list --json --fresh --worktree-id <id>`.
3. Allow a complete resident reconciliation cycle, then repeat both reads.
4. Re-run `<project> worktrees doctor --json`; `head_cache.found` must be zero.
5. Re-run the cwd comparison for all inactive/finalized heads. No head session
   may have a cwd outside its worktree.

If the old head returns, do not keep overwriting the cache. Re-check for a
foreign registration (class **F**) or an incomplete handoff edge (class **G**)
and repair that cause.

### Last resort — content-grep the transcript bodies (expensive; explicitly initiated)

Only when 1–3 can't resolve it (e.g. the store index is unavailable, or you must
prove a worktree has **no** transcript *anywhere*) fall back to grepping transcript
bodies across the whole state root. This is **more expensive than the sanctioned
`backfill-sessions` sweep** — it reads every session's `events.jsonl` / `session.db`
(megabytes each), not just `workspace.yaml`. It is acceptable **only** here: an
**on-demand, agent-driven recovery inquiry**, which is exactly the "explicitly
initiated by a user or an agent" exception the
[`session-state-access`](../../../../docs/patterns/session-state-access.md)
invariant carves out. **Never** put a sweep like this on any hot / automated path.

```
# LAST RESORT: for each session-state dir, does events.jsonl / session.db contain "<worktree-suffix>"?
#   hit whose OWN cwd == the worktree  → a real in-worktree session (classes A–C)
#   hit whose cwd is a DIFFERENT wt    → incidental mention (usually the class-D parent)
#   only zero-data stubs match         → class D or E (no transcript to recover)
```

The `parent_session` on a session-less worktree (from `doctor`'s alignment audit)
usually **is** the class-D parent that created it — cross-check it against these
grep hits before spending the sweep.

## Liveness trumps git state — never reap a live worktree

A worktree's **liveness** — a live `wt-<id>` mux session **or** a live Copilot
session lock (`inuse.<pid>.lock`) — is authoritative and **trumps git/record
state, always.** A worktree that is `finalized` / merged / clean is **still
active** if it is sitting in a live mux or holds a live lock (e.g. resumed by a
psmux startup-restore). *"Active" means "intentionally in a mux."* Never reap,
clean, or GC such a worktree out from under its live session — a merged/clean git
state is **not** license to reap.

- `gc` / `cleanup` already consult liveness: their `active` prune-bucket spares a
  worktree whose path is in the live-session set (`_build_active_paths` = the live
  mux batch + the cached `mux_live` / `bound_live` hints + the registered-session
  lock scan). Prefer these commands to hand-reaping.
- **But the cached signal can lag.** Historically `mux_live` was only stamped at
  launch / Stop / teardown and **never refreshed**, so a mux created *after* that
  stamp (a startup-restore landing minutes after resume) persisted a stale
  `false`, and the worktree could be misclassified `completed` and lose its
  protection. Fixed in **agent-worktrees ≥ 1.5.3-dev476** — the off-hot-path
  populate/doctor sweep now reconciles `mux_live` alongside `bound_live`. On older
  builds, **verify liveness against the live scan before reaping.**
- **Before any bulk `<project> worktrees cleanup --clean`**, confirm no target is in a live mux
  (`psmux list-sessions` / `tmux list-sessions`) or holds a live lock. When in doubt, prefer **per-item
  `<project> worktrees cleanup --worktree-id <id> --clean`** (add `--include-unused` for a
  no-commit/no-turn shell) — it re-checks prune-safety and refuses an active
  session, so you can target exactly the intended (e.g. unused / titleless)
  worktrees without risking a live-mux sibling.

## Orphaned bound Copilot with no mux — Reclaim, not Resume

A worktree can show **Active** but offer only **Resume** when a bound Copilot (a
live `inuse.<pid>.lock`) owns it while its `wt-<id>` mux is gone — a bare /
orphaned resume (e.g. a startup-restore whose launcher shell died). Resuming
forks a second Copilot that collides with the live lock (*"active process
lock"*). The picker is meant to offer **Reclaim / Stop** for this state. To
resolve by hand:

- **Reclaim the orphan, then resume fresh:**
  ```
  <project> worktrees reclaim --worktree-id <id> --bare-only        # dry run — lists targets
  <project> worktrees reclaim --worktree-id <id> --bare-only --yes  # reap bare orphans
  ```
  A Copilot that is **mux-homed but its mux has died** is *not* `--bare-only` (its
  cwd is the worktree, homing `mux`); target it with
  `<project> worktrees reclaim --worktree-id <id> --yes` (no `--bare-only`).
- **Windows has no `remux`** (ConPTY cannot adopt a running process) — the
  `reclaim` → resume-fresh path above is the only route; do not expect to reattach
  a bare Copilot in place.
- **Clean residual stale locks:** after the process is gone, a dead-PID
  `inuse.<pid>.lock` can linger and keep the session looking busy. Remove **only**
  locks whose PID is confirmed dead (validate the PID first), then resume.

## Deep close-out — investigate a worktree's footprint, and let it self-close

Before reaping a worktree, remember it may own **claims and off-machine state**:
it may have dug into a **Codespace**, a **cross-repo worktree**, one or more
**cross-repo PRs**, borrowed containers, or other shared spaces. Reaping it
blindly orphans those. Close-out is deeper than the local git/liveness check.

- **Check the claim ledger — but do not trust it alone.**
  ```
  <project> worktrees claims <id>                  # outbound resources it owns + inbound tasks
  ```
  `finalize` is claim-aware (its gate blocks on unreleased outbound claims), and
  `claims release <ref>` / `claims settle <ref>` / `claims sweep --apply` retire
  them. A stale **leaseable** claim (a Codespace/container settled elsewhere or on
  another machine, or a bridge-driven box) is reclaimed by `claims sweep` reading
  the lease's mirrored disposition. If you had to `finalize --abandon` a worktree,
  its still-unsettled obligations are re-homed to the durable **orphanage** —
  ownership does **not** transfer anonymously. The creating agent must close
  every resource itself unless the operator explicitly directs a handoff to a
  named recipient/flow. Without that instruction, stop and ask; do not pass
  `--abandon`. The accepted form is
  `finalize --abandon --handoff-to <recipient-or-flow>`; the target is persisted
  on every orphan entry, and the creating agent remains responsible until the
  named flow accepts it.
  `claims orphans` lists them; immediately dry-run
  `claims cleanup <source-worktree-id>`, investigate every selected child, close
  it through its owning lifecycle, then use the same selective command with
  `--apply` and confirm no matches remain. An unfiltered `claims cleanup --apply`
  acts on the entire orphanage and may delete unrelated resources; never use it
  as a reflexive "clear the blocker" command. If you cannot close a child, record
  and explicitly transfer responsibility for each ref rather than reporting the
  parent fully closed. **But the
  ledger is best-effort and relatively new:** many older worktrees show `(none)`
  even though they really did touch a Codespace or a cross-repo PR — those actions
  predate consistent claim-journaling. An empty ledger is *not* proof of an empty
  footprint.
- **Deep-investigate what it actually touched.** Corroborate the ledger against
  the worktree's own history and artifacts:
  ```
  <project> worktrees recent-messages --worktree <id>      # quick peek at recent work
  <project> worktrees head-session --worktree <id>         # resolve its head session id
  <project> worktrees session-transcript <session_id>      # full transcript of what it did
  ```
  plus its effort file, and its branch's cross-repo footprint (Codespaces it
  connected to, `<other-repo>` worktrees/PRs it opened). **Be willing to dig into
  those dependent spaces** and verify each is closed out (PR merged/closed,
  Codespace done/stopped, cross-repo worktree finalized, container lease
  released) *before* reaping the owner.
- **Best: file a durable close-out *task* and let worktrees resolve async.**
  Rather than reconstruct each footprint by hand, queue a close-out task with a
  strong wind-down **goal** and let a worker (often the worktree itself) drive it
  — worktrees then resolve **asynchronously over a duration**, at scale, instead
  of blocking this session. Use the **agent-dispatch** queue:
  ```
  <agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> create "Close out <id>" \
    --target-worktree <id> --dedup-key closeout:<id> \
    --goal "Wind down cleanly — everything filed or built out as efforts" \
    --done-criteria "cross-repo PRs landed/closed; Codespaces disconnected; \
      cross-repo worktrees finalized; claims released; worktree finalized" \
    --prompt "Close out worktree <id>. Investigate what it touched (its claims \
      ledger, session transcript, effort files, cross-repo PRs/Codespaces). File \
      or build out any unfinished work as efforts, land or close cross-repo PRs, \
      disconnect Codespaces, finalize cross-repo worktrees, release/settle your \
      claims, then finalize."
  ```
  **Dedup first** (`<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]> find` / `sweep`) so you file one close-out per
  worktree; workers then `claim` → `start` → `complete` it on their own cadence.
  `--spawn` (with `--spawn-backend bridge` or `embody`) kicks a worker
  immediately; otherwise the task waits in the queue for async pickup — prefer the
  **queued** path (see the headed-resume caveat below).
- **Or drive one now (synchronous).** To close a single worktree immediately,
  embody its session directly — `embody` is **agent-worktrees'** embodiment verb
  (it resumes a detached session and auto-registers with **agent-bridge**), not
  an agent-dispatch verb (agent-dispatch merely *uses* it as a spawn backend):
  ```
  <project> worktrees embody --worktree-id <id> --seed "Close yourself out: land or close \
    any cross-repo PRs, disconnect any Codespace, finalize any cross-repo \
    worktrees, release your claims, then finalize."

  Let the worktree confirm it is fully wrapped up, *then* finalize/reap it. Only
  fall back to manual `claims release`/`sweep` for a worktree that genuinely
  cannot be resumed (its session is gone) or whose obligations are provably
  gone-and-safe.

## Notes

- Idempotent: a second `--fix` run finds nothing new.
- The misalignment audit is informational — the resume path no longer honors a
  foreign `parent_session` for cwd, so opening a worktree always runs in its own
  directory.
