"""agent-worktrees config-schema migration wiring.

This is the plugin-side adapter over the vendored ``config_migrate`` library
(see ``libs/config-migrate``). It:

* registers agent-worktrees' machine-local YAML schemas
  (``agent-worktrees/{config,repos,projects}``) and their ``vN->vN+1`` migrators,
* enumerates the managed files by convention from the discoverable install root
  (``~/.agent-worktrees/``) for the **eager** install/update path
  (``run_migrations``), and
* exposes ``migrate_loaded`` for the **lazy** loader path -- a never-raising
  wrapper the config readers apply on read so a still-old file loads at the
  current shape *before* ``update`` has rewritten it.

Scope is **machine-local only** (the install-vs-adopt boundary): the runtime
root's ``config.yaml`` / ``repos.yaml`` / ``projects.yaml``. Repo-committed YAML
(``machines.yaml``, in-repo ``.agent-worktrees/*``) is an ``adopt`` concern and
is deliberately NOT migrated here.

Baseline (B4): each schema is registered at **v1** with no migrators, so the
first migrate merely *stamps* ``schema_version: 1`` onto an unmarked file --
proving the pipeline end-to-end with zero behavior change. The first real
``vN->vN+1`` migrator lands only when a shape actually evolves.

The whole module is import-guarded: if the vendored library is not present in
the venv (e.g. running from a source checkout that never ran the installer),
every entry point degrades to a safe no-op rather than breaking config loading.
