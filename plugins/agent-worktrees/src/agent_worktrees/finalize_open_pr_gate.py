"""finalize's backup open-PR gate -- defense-in-depth against a worktree
finalizing while its own attributed PR is still open.

Extracted out of ``finalize.py`` (at its grandfathered module-size ceiling)
rather than inlined there -- mirrors the ``pr_reconcile.py`` /
``session_host_liveness.py`` / ``worktree_probe.py`` precedent of landing new
capability in a fresh same-package module instead of chasing a shrinking
ceiling line-by-line.

``_pr_finalize_precondition`` (in ``finalize.py``) treats "content already
reachable on origin/<default>" as sufficient to finalize, reasoning that
content parity implies the tracked PR merged -- but content can
coincidentally match upstream for a different reason entirely (a *later* PR
happened to land patch-equivalent work; a squash collision) while THIS
worktree's own attributed PR is still sitting open on the provider.
:func:`assert_no_live_pr` is independent of that fast path: it live-reconciles
every tracked PR (not just the "active" one -- parallel PRs get their own
live re-check too, via :func:`reconcile_every_live_pr`) against the provider,
then refuses finalize while any of them is still genuinely open. A worktree
whose local record was never populated at all (``create-pr``/``set-pr`` were
bypassed) is outside this gate's reach -- it is a backup on top of the pr-*
tools establishing claims correctly, not a replacement for them.

:func:`content_exceeds_merged_head` is a second, orthogonal gate added here
for the same module-size reason (#4388): it catches a keep-alive worktree
that kept committing *after* its tracked PR merged -- a case
:func:`assert_no_live_pr` cannot see, since the merged PR is terminal, not
live.

    A legacy flow can reuse the SAME local branch name across sequential
    PRs on one long-lived worktree (``tracking._merge_pr_attribution_state``
    documents this exact reuse pattern for ``pr_id``-less records) -- the

    tie-breaker -- concurrent-save reconciliation can append an older
    unmatched on-disk entry after a newer in-memory one, #4699): iterating
    raw list order for a reused name can select an older SHA and recreate
    the exact false positive this fix exists to close. Entries for a

    an already-advanced branch tip paired against a stale, superseded
    ``head_sha`` from an earlier reuse read every commit made for a LATER
    reuse of that name as "extra" commits beyond that stale boundary,
    falsely blocking finalize on content that had already landed.
    Processing in recency order and overwriting on each repeat occurrence
    keeps whichever entry is chronologically LAST for any reused branch
    name.

    The LATEST tracked entry for a reused name is not necessarily the one
    that actually merged either (#4699): a REJECTED (closed, never merged)
    reuse can be the most recent, with its own unmerged commit as the
    branch's current tip -- pairing it unconditionally would read "zero
    extra commits" and certify that unmerged commit safe. A
    confirmed-terminal-non-merge entry (``tracking._pr_is_terminal`` true,
    ``state`` not ``"merged"``) therefore never overwrites an existing
