"""Durable, SQLite-backed status cache for the worktree-status accelerator.

Per-worktree bundles (see :mod:`worktree_status_daemon`) are read from an
**in-memory dict** -- the true, current authority, never blocked on disk I/O
on the request path -- and best-effort persisted to a single WAL-mode SQLite
file so a restarted daemon warm-restores instead of starting cold. This is
deliberately the same durable-store technology agent-dispatch already uses
(single-writer, WAL-mode SQLite) rather than ``list_cache.py``'s file-
sidecar-per-args-shape pattern, per the operator's explicit steer.

Freshness model (see the effort README's Phase 1 design for the full
rationale):

- A read for a worktree already in the in-memory cache and not yet past its
  TTL returns instantly, no recompute.
- A read past its TTL, or never before demanded (cold), or carrying
  ``force=True`` recomputes via the caller-supplied ``compute`` callback,
  then write-through updates both the in-memory dict and the SQLite row.
- Every read registers **demand** (a `demanded_at` timestamp) so a
  background sweep (:meth:`WorktreeStatusCache.sweep_due`) knows which
  worktrees are worth proactively refreshing -- mirroring
  ``list_cache.py``'s own demand-registration concept, applied here to an
  in-memory store instead of file sidecars.

Never raises past :meth:`WorktreeStatusCache.get_or_refresh`: any SQLite
failure (corruption, permissions, disk full) degrades to in-memory-only
operation -- durability is a nice-to-have across restarts, never a
requirement for the cache to function this session.

#: How long a cached bundle is trusted before an ordinary (non-forced) read
#: triggers a recompute. Originally set assuming a cheap ~5 git-call bundle;
#: live measurement (2026-09-22, machine CPU-saturation investigation) found
#: the daemon's status-monitor process sustaining ~83-99% CPU continuously
#: for hours with as few as 7 demanded worktrees. Root cause: a real
#: compute() call costs ~5-6s (the unavoidable `git fetch` in
#: `classify_worktree`, not a cheap local read), so the prior 20s TTL asked
#: the single-threaded sweep loop to refresh every demanded worktree
#: roughly every 20-30s regardless of that ~5-6s real cost -- with N
#: demanded worktrees the sweep needs N * ~6s of CPU-bound work per TTL
#: window, which already exceeds one CPU core's capacity at N >= ~4,
#: guaranteeing the sweep thread runs almost continuously back-to-back
#: rather than mostly idling between ticks. An initial raise to 90s (live-
#: verified) only brought steady-state utilization down to ~60% for a
#: real N=7 -- the theoretical floor (N * ~6s / TTL) at that TTL is still
#: ~47%, too high for a background accelerator. Raised further to 180s
#: (theoretical floor ~23% for the same N=7), live-verified over a 10+
#: minute settled window. Safe to raise on its own: `worktree_status_audit
#: .py`'s own freshness bound is computed as `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS +
#: SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS + FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS` (see that module), so
#: it moves with this constant rather than being a fixed ceiling this
#: change could violate.
DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS = 180.0

#: A demanded worktree not read again within this window is no longer swept
#: -- an operator who closed the card / moved on stops paying the sweep cost
#: for it. Generous relative to a single render session.
DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS = 300.0

#: Defense-in-depth cap on how many entries one `sweep_due` call will
#: recompute, regardless of how many are due. Even after raising
#: DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS to reflect real compute cost, an operator whose
#: demanded-worktree count grows well past what one CPU core can refresh
#: within a TTL window would otherwise reproduce the same continuous-CPU
#: symptom at a higher N. Capping bounds worst-case *recompute* cost (the
#: expensive per-entry work -- an unavoidable `git fetch` -- that this
#: whole cap exists to bound) to `max_refresh_per_sweep * (per-entry
#: compute cost)` every sweep tick, independent of N -- excess due entries
#: are simply picked up on a later tick (prioritizing the stalest first,
#: see `sweep_due`), trading a wider worst-case staleness for a hard
#: recompute-CPU ceiling rather than the reverse. The due/expired
#: bookkeeping around that cap (scanning `self._entries` to find what's
#: due, then selecting the cap-many stalest via `heapq.nsmallest`) is
#: still O(N) in the demanded-worktree count -- but N cheap dict/heap
#: operations, several orders of magnitude below one recompute's ~5-6s
#: `git fetch`, is a different cost class from the thing this cap actually
#: protects against (Copilot review, PR #3348); a persistent priority
#: index would remove even that O(N) scan if it's ever needed at a much
#: larger N than this accelerator currently targets.

        entry's last-known value in place rather than losing it.

        The cap is defense-in-depth against the exact CPU-saturation bug
        found live (2026-09-22): a real per-entry recompute costs several
        seconds (an unavoidable git fetch), so refreshing an unbounded
        number of due entries every sweep tick can demand more CPU than one
        core provides, leaving the sweep thread running back-to-back with
        no idle gaps. Prioritizing the stalest-attempted entries first means
        an operator with more demanded worktrees than the cap can serve per
        tick sees some entries age further past their nominal TTL rather
        than the daemon's CPU cost growing unbounded with demand -- a
        graceful, self-limiting degradation instead of the reverse.

        Priority is by ``_last_attempted`` (updated on every attempt,
        success OR failure), not bare ``computed_at`` (Copilot review,
        PR #3348): ``computed_at`` only advances on a successful refresh, so
        a persistently-failing entry would otherwise remain "the stalest"
        forever and monopolize every cap slot, starving every other due
        entry from ever being attempted. Recording the attempt time
        regardless of outcome rotates a failing entry to the back of the
        queue exactly like a succeeding one, so demand beyond capacity is
        served round-robin across attempts rather than jamming on one
        chronically-broken worktree.

        Each entry is sampled, then recomputed **outside** the lock (the same
        reason ``get_or_refresh`` computes outside it) -- so a concurrent
        request-driven refresh (an ordinary miss, or an explicit force) for
        the SAME key can complete first. Publishing this sweep's own result
        unconditionally in that case would silently overwrite the newer
        value with a stale one for a full TTL window. Guarded by checking
        the entry's ``computed_at`` is still exactly what was sampled before
        writing -- if it advanced, something else already refreshed this key
        more recently, so this sweep's answer is simply discarded here
        (never written to memory or SQLite).
