"""Foreign-repo PR creation from an already-pushed branch -- no local
checkout required (``pull-request-capability`` effort, Phase 2d).

New module rather than extending ``pr_ops.py`` (already at its grandfathered
line-count ceiling): the motivating case is a host agent whose worktree never
checked out the target repo at all -- a container, another host, or any
other process already pushed the feature branch there, and the calling
worktree just wants to open the PR and durably own the resulting obligation.
``create_pr``'s own ~400-line local path (squash, push, title derivation from
commit history, branch-reuse semantics) is entirely inapplicable here and
deliberately NOT reused; what IS reused is the same provider dispatch
(``providers.get_provider``/``account_token_for_slug``/``PRScope``) and the
same claim-journal primitive (``pr_ops._ensure_pr_claim``) the local path
already relies on, so both paths converge on identical claim/attribution
semantics rather than growing two divergent implementations.

Always auto-journals a ``pr``-kind claim on the calling worktree itself --
never the manual ``claims add pr`` workaround ``venue-and-claims.md``
documents as today's only path. This is deliberately NOT also appended to the
calling worktree's own ``prs`` list (unlike a PR the worktree's own checkout
opened): the calling worktree never owns this PR's lifecycle in the full
create-pr sense (it has no checkout to push updates from), only the
obligation to see it through -- a claim is the right-sized bookkeeping,
not a full tracked-PR record.
