"""``pr-complete`` -- reconcile the worktree after its PR squash-merges.

The post-merge git step the ``pr-*`` family owns.  After the review gate
**squash-merges** a PR, the worktree branch (``worktree/<id>``) still sits on the
pre-merge squashed commit -- *ahead* of the old upstream but with work that is
already present on the *new* upstream (folded into one squash commit).  Two
existing moves both misbehave here:

- a strict **fast-forward** refuses (the branch is ``ahead > 0`` -- the pain in
  test-chamber #2147, where ``finalize`` balks after an external squash-merge);
- a plain **rebase** *replays* the local commit onto the new upstream, which can
  hit a phantom conflict when the squash-merge folded/re-ordered the change.

``pr-complete`` **rebases the branch forward first** -- a non-destructive replay
that drops commits already applied upstream (by patch-id) while **preserving any
genuinely-new commit**, including one authored *after* the merge whose content
happens to coincide with upstream (the test-chamber #2854 regression, where a
blanket hard reset silently discarded such a commit and left ``create-pr``
reporting "nothing ahead").  Only when that rebase **phantom-conflicts** -- the
squash-merge case where several branch commits were folded into one upstream
commit, so a per-commit replay conflicts even though the net content is
identical -- does it fall back to **fast-forwarding past the squash** by
hard-resetting to the upstream tip.  That fallback is gated on the branch's work
being confirmed already on upstream (tree/blob equivalence), so the reset is
content-lossless -- the #2147 fix, which succeeds where a strict fast-forward
refuses on ``ahead > 0``.  A pre-reconcile backup ref is written for
recoverability whichever path runs.

This is distinct from ``finalize`` (worktree-lifecycle cleanup): ``pr-complete``
lands the worktree *forward* after a merge; a keep-alive worktree runs it and
keeps working.
