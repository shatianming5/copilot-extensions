"""On-disk orphan-directory garbage collection for the worktree fleet.

An **orphan directory** is a directory under a worktree root that is *neither* a
registered git worktree (``git worktree list``) *nor* a tracking record -- pure
filesystem cruft left behind by an interrupted or forced worktree removal (the
directory survives after its git registration + tracking YAML are gone). These
accumulate over time and are invisible to both ``git worktree prune`` (it only
drops the metadata, never the leftover directory) and ``cleanup`` (it works from
tracking records, which the orphan no longer has). See issues #66, #828, #1027.

This module finds orphans and removes the **effectively-empty** ones -- a
leftover whose tree contains no real files (only empty subdirs or known
ephemeral caches like ``__pycache__`` / ``.pytest_cache``). A leftover that
still holds real files is **reported, never auto-deleted** -- it may carry
un-rescued work and belongs to manual review. Removal uses a **locked-directory
retry/skip**: on Windows a just-finalized directory can linger under a transient
handle (#828), so a ``PermissionError`` is retried once and then skipped with a
reason rather than crashing the sweep.

The sweep is pure/inspectable: ``find_orphans`` and ``classify_orphan`` take no
side effects; only ``sweep_orphans`` mutates the filesystem (and only when not
``dry_run``).
