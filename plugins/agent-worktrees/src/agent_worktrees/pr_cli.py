    Distinct from :func:`_tracked_pr_head_evidence`, which only returns a value
    once the provider's own ``observe_head`` has matched it (evidence suitable
    for *trusting* the provider). This one answers a narrower, pre-merge
    safety question instead: "what did we ourselves just push?" -- so
    ``pr-merge --now`` can hand it to the provider's merge call as
    ``--match-head-commit`` and let the provider's own merge endpoint refuse
    rather than silently merge a stale head the PR object hasn't caught up to

    outright by itself.

    Resolves the tracking path against the **supplied** ``config.repo_name``
    (never the ambient active project) so `` pr-merge --config <other>``
    looks up the right project's tracking record instead of silently missing
    it and disabling the safeguard.

    Always scans **every** tracked worktree record in that project -- never
    returns early on a CWD-derived record's match alone. A CWD match is a
    useful hint for *which* record to prefer, but it is not proof that no
    *other* record claims the same ``(repo, number, provider)`` with a
    different (possibly staler) ``head_sha``; returning the CWD record's
    value without checking the rest would let a stale record silently win
    and hand ``--match-head-commit`` the very stale value this safeguard
    exists to catch (ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#5034). A
    neutral CWD (a supported ``--project <name> pr-merge <repo> <n> --now``
    invocation moves the process to the project's **anchor**, never a
    tracked worktree, so CWD inference returns nothing there) and a
    cross-project ``--config <other>`` invocation run from *inside a
    different project's own worktree* are both handled the same way: the
