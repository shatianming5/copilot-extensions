#: Every claim kind this repo recognizes today (Phase 6 canonical-ref
#: design, worktree-claims-transitive-finalization effort, 2026-10-04) --
#: the union of ``claims_rank.DEFAULT_LABEL_PREFIX``'s keys plus the
#: PR-like kinds (``claims_rank._PR_LIKE_KINDS``). Duplicated here rather
#: than imported: ``claims_rank`` is deliberately import-free (pure
#: arithmetic -- see its own module docstring), so this module owns its own
#: copy of the vocabulary instead of creating a dependency the other way.
#: NOT used to gate :func:`decanonicalize_ref`'s detection (the
#: :data:`_CANONICAL_SENTINEL` below does that unambiguously, so a
#: plugin-contributed kind via ``claim_kinds_registry`` round-trips too) --
#: this is purely a convenience set for callers building an
#: ``expected_kinds`` restriction.
CLAIM_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "worktree", "session", "codespace", "container", "task", "bridge",
    "ssh", "effort", "workdir", "pr", "bug", "issue",
})

#: The PR-like subset of :data:`CLAIM_KINDS` (mirrors
#: ``claims_rank._PR_LIKE_KINDS``) -- exposed for the rare caller that
#: actually accepts more than one PR-like kind. Most PR-only entry points
#: (``cleanup._pr_claim_target``, ``sweep.py``'s PR view-arg builders) are
#: reached only for ``kind="pr"`` in practice (their own dispatch tables
#: key on it exclusively) and should restrict to ``frozenset({"pr"})``
#: directly rather than this broader set -- see each call site's own
#: comment for why.
PR_LIKE_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"pr", "bug", "issue"})

#: A reserved, unambiguous marker prefixing every canonical ref -- chosen
#: specifically so detection in :func:`decanonicalize_ref` never depends on
#: guessing whether a leading token is "a known claim kind" (closed
#: vocabulary, breaks for a plugin-contributed kind) or coincidentally
#: matches an opaque legacy ref that already happens to read like
#: ``"<kind>:<system>:<key>"`` (e.g. a pre-existing ``task`` ref literally
#: named ``"pr::foo"``, or a bare worktree id ``"worktree::foo"``) --
#: without this sentinel either case is silently misdetected as already
#: canonical and decoded, corrupting the legacy value. No legacy ref in
#: this codebase (or realistically producible by any adopter) starts with
#: this literal prefix, so its presence alone is the ONLY signal
#: :func:`decanonicalize_ref` needs; it no longer needs to validate the
#: embedded kind against a closed vocabulary at all.
#:
#: **Reservation invariant (accepted residual risk):** this prefix is
#: RESERVED -- no legitimate legacy ref value may ever literally equal or
#: start with it. This is airtight for every opaque legacy ref this
#: codebase produces today (CodeSpace names, container/task ids, PR
#: shorthand/URLs, structured worktree/session refs) -- none of those
#: generators ever emit this literal string. It is a documented
#: convention, not independently enforced at every ref-creation call site
#: (`claims_cli._claims_add` et al.), because :func:`canonicalize_ref` is
#: not yet wired into any of them (see the effort's own "additive, no
#: emission yet" migration decision) -- there is no live producer this
#: invariant could currently be violated by. If a future change wires
#: emission into a path that accepts arbitrary caller-supplied ref text,
#: add validation there to reject a ref already carrying this prefix
#: before it is ever persisted, closing the single remaining theoretical
#: collision (a hand-crafted or otherwise coincidental legacy ref that
#: happens to equal this exact sentinel-prefixed string).
_CANONICAL_SENTINEL = "cref1:"

#: ``cref1:<kind>:<system>:<key>`` -- the Phase 6 canonical, self-describing
#: claim ref shape. The :data:`_CANONICAL_SENTINEL` above (not the bare
#: ``kind`` token) is what makes this detectable without ambiguity.

    """Render ``ref`` (a claim of kind ``kind``) in the Phase 6 canonical,
    self-describing ``"cref1:<kind>:<system>:<key>"`` form.

    **Additive, never a replacement**: nothing persisted today is
    rewritten by this function existing, and :func:`decanonicalize_ref`
    losslessly recovers the exact legacy-shaped string from whatever this
    returns -- every existing kind-specific parser (:func:`parse_claim_ref`,
    ``claims_rank._parse_pr_like_ref``, ``cleanup._pr_claim_target``,
    ``sweep.py``'s PR view-arg builders) keeps accepting its own native
    shape completely unmodified; see this change's own tracking effort's
    README (in the downstream control-plane repo that coordinates this
    plugin, not this repo) Phase 6 section for the full design rationale
    and the "additive, not a breaking rewrite" migration decision.

    For ``worktree``/``session`` kinds, ``system`` is the owning machine
    and ``key`` is ``project/worktree_id[#session]`` (the rest of
    :func:`format_claim_ref`'s own grammar) -- this round-trips exactly
    through :func:`decanonicalize_ref`, UNLESS the machine name itself
    contains a ``:`` (machine aliases carry no token restriction -- see
    ``config.py``), which would corrupt the ``system``/``key`` split; that
    case falls through to the opaque form below instead, which is always
    lossless since it carries the original ref verbatim. Every other kind
    (PR-like or opaque) has no independently-meaningful "system" token
    today (a PR's provider is already recoverable from its own ref shape;
    an opaque id like a CodeSpace name carries no separate system at all),
    so ``system`` is left empty and ``key`` is the existing ref verbatim.
    Idempotent: a ``ref`` already in canonical form **for this exact
    ``kind``** is returned unchanged -- checked by matching the embedded
    kind, not just "does this look canonical for *some* kind" (an opaque
    ref for kind ``"task"`` that happens to already read like
    ``"cref1:pr:...:..."`` must still be wrapped as ``task`` -- treating it
    as already-canonical would silently mislabel it as a ``pr`` ref and
    break the round trip). An empty ``ref`` is returned unchanged -- there
    is nothing to canonicalize, and wrapping it (``"cref1:<kind>::"``)
    would not round-trip: the canonical grammar's ``key`` segment requires
    at least one character, so :func:`decanonicalize_ref` could never
    recover an empty string from it.
