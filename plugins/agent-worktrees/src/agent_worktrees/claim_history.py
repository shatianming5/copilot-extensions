"""Append-only, timestamped ownership-history ledger for a claimed resource.

Current-owner claim state (``ResourceClaim.state``) only ever answers "who
holds this NOW" -- a single PR can be picked up by multiple
worktrees/sessions over its life (errors, redrives, rebinds), and nothing
preserves *who else ever touched it, in what order, when*. This module is
that durable, append-only record, scoped today to ``pr``-kind claims and
fed from every known persisted mutation path for a ``pr``-kind claim:
``tracking_claim_write.py``'s three single-worktree claim verbs
(add/release/settle), ``pr_ops.py``'s own direct create/merge-driven
claim/release calls, ``finalize.py``'s bulk release-on-finalize, and
``claims_cli.py``'s ``sweep --apply``/``reconcile-at-rest --apply`` batch
release paths. Every call site records history only AFTER its own save is
durably confirmed -- never before, or a save failure could leave a false
event for a mutation that never actually persisted.

``worktree run``'s own PR-claim persistence path (``worktree_ops_cli.py``)
is also wired (worktree-claims-transitive-finalization Phase 3b,
2026-10-03): tracing its save semantics found **two** distinct append+save
sites for a produced ``pr``-kind claim -- ``cmd_run``'s own
``_finish_pending`` closure (the actual live site: it replaces the
pending-``workdir`` placeholder with the real claim once the inner command
returns) and ``_journal_run_claim`` (a separately-tested pure helper not
currently called from ``cmd_run``'s own live flow, but sharing the exact
same append+save shape, so left wired for parity rather than silently
missing the ledger if it's ever reconnected or reused). Both record an
``event="claimed"`` entry only after their own save is durably confirmed,
and both follow the same idempotency contract ``pr_ops._ensure_pr_claim``
established: a ref already an active ``pr`` claim before the mutation is
a no-op reconciliation, not a fresh transition, so a repeat ``run``
re-observing the same already-claimed PR never feeds a duplicate event.

**Claim-handoff bundle transitions are wired**
(worktree-claims-transitive-finalization Phase 3b, 2026-10-03):
``claim_handoffs.py``'s own accept flow -- an explicit, deliberate transfer
of a resource claim from one worktree to another, distinct from the
implicit reassignment cases below -- feeds this ledger at its two genuine
mutation sites: ``accept_source()`` (an ``event="released"`` entry on the
SOURCE worktree, once its own claim removal is saved) and
``_finish_accept_consumer_side()`` (an ``event="claimed"`` entry on the
CONSUMER worktree, once its own claim addition is saved). Both carry a
``note`` identifying the bundle id and the other side, so a bundle-driven
transfer is distinguishable in the history from an ordinary claim/release.
Only ``pr``-kind claims in a bundle feed this ledger (``claim_history`` is
``pr``-kind only); a ``worktree``/``codespace``/``container``/``task``
claim transferred by the same bundle is untouched. Gated on the actual
transition happening (``accept_source`` short-circuits before its own
save on an already-``accepted`` retry; the consumer side only records for
refs genuinely newly added this call, matching every other idempotency
guard in this module), so a retried/idempotent accept never double-records.
Declining or cancelling a bundle is NOT fed here -- it only clears the
source claim's reservation (``handoff_bundle``), the claim itself never
changes worktree, so there is no reassignment to record.

**Explicitly NOT yet covered by this slice** (tracked as a remaining
follow-up, not silently dropped):

- **Implicit** reassignment: an agent-dispatch task redrive/reassignment
  after an error, or an agent-bridge session rebind to a worktree, both
  change "who is actually working this PR right now" without ever calling
  any of this plugin's own claim verbs. The agent-bridge session-rebind
  half is wired (worktree-claims-transitive-finalization Phase 3b,
  2026-10-02): every context-handoff cutover
  (``tracking_lifecycle.link_handoff()``) now feeds an
  ``event="reassigned"`` entry for every still-ACTIVE ``pr``-kind claim the
  worktree holds, right alongside that function's own existing
  predecessor/successor audit trail (``record.handoffs``) -- see
  ``tracking_lifecycle.record_pr_claims_reassigned()``. The agent-dispatch
  task-redrive half was investigated and found to have no live code path
  to hook today (``dispatch_attempt`` is write-once at worktree creation;
  the one related check, ``worktree_attribution.foreign_task_id``, is a
  defensive reject of a stale carried worktree id, never an active
  reassignment) -- still unstarted, and tracked only in the consuming
  deployment's own private effort tracker, not here.

**Remote-mirroring is wired** (worktree-claims-transitive-finalization
Phase 3b, 2026-10-03): this ledger is still local-write-only (unchanged
above), but :mod:`claim_history_mirror` can push any locally-recorded event
to its own append-only ref on the same shared store repo
:mod:`lease_store` already uses for cross-machine lease coordination --
opt-in, via ``agent-worktrees gc --mirror-claim-history`` (never
synchronous with a live claim mutation; see that module's own docstring
for why). ``agent-worktrees claims history <ref> --remote`` merges a
ref's local events with its mirrored ones for display.

**Concurrent writers.** Multiple independent processes can append a claim
event at once (the CLI, a resident daemon dispatch, ``pr_ops``'s own
reconcile path). A plain ``O_APPEND`` write is not a documented
cross-platform atomicity guarantee, so every append here takes the same
real cross-process advisory lock ``handoff_trace.py`` already established
for this exact problem (``fcntl``/``msvcrt``), rather than relying on
filesystem append semantics alone.

**Ordering is best-effort, not a total order.** Every write-path caller
appends immediately after confirming ITS OWN record save succeeded (never
batched/deferred across multiple records), and the append lock itself
guarantees no two appends interleave mid-line. What is NOT guaranteed:
two genuinely concurrent transitions on the SAME ref, saved under two
different record locks milliseconds apart, could still append in an order
that does not exactly match which save committed to disk first -- there is
no single lock spanning "save a record" and "append its history entry"
across every caller. Treat this ledger as "every real transition gets
recorded, each one truthfully after its own save succeeded" rather than
"a strictly serialized timeline safe to diff for exact interleavings."
