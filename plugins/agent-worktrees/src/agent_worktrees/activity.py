"""Append-only worktree activity log -- high-level lifecycle events.

Records the high-level lifecycle of worktrees and their Copilot/mux
sessions to a machine-global JSONL file at
``~/.agent-worktrees/logs/activity.jsonl``.  Unlike the per-PID launcher
setup logs under ``$TMPDIR/worktree-setup-logs`` (capped at the 10 newest
and wiped on reboot), this log persists across reboots and accumulates a
rolling window of history (default 7 days), so session-lifecycle anomalies
-- e.g. a finalized worktree whose tmux/Copilot session is never reaped --
can be reconstructed after the fact.

Both the Python lifecycle code and the bash launcher append here (the
launcher via ``agent-worktrees activity-log``), so a single file captures
the full picture across processes.

Events are intentionally high-level:

  boot_trace                always-on payload-launch timing from the shell
                            launcher / resolver path
  worktree_created          a new worktree + branch was created
  worktree_resumed          an existing worktree was resumed via the picker
  launcher_started          the session launcher began a launch flow (carries
                            launch_id + the setup-log path)
  session_started           a Copilot session registered against a worktree
  session_ended             a Copilot session deregistered
  ahp_session_bound         an AHP session was created or verified for a worktree
  ahp_session_disposed      the bound AHP session was explicitly disposed
  copilot_exited            the Copilot process exited (launcher)
  pane_exited               the wrapped pane command exited (pane wrapper) --
                            the only mark carrying the mux pane's real exit_code
  mux_attached              a tmux/psmux session was attached/joined (launcher);
                            fresh creation carries its attempt count
  mux_session_assigned      the programmatic cutover path's mux pane creation
                            succeeded (mux_new_session/mux_new_window) --
                            stage 2's other emitter, alongside mux_attached
  copilot_invoked           the Copilot binary was actually exec'd (the true
                            final resolution point in the setup launcher)
  copilot_invocation_attempted
                            launch-command's wrapper handed off to a
                            config-driven launch template or legacy
                            tools/setup/setup.{sh,ps1} -- a coarser mark for
                            paths that never reach default-setup's own
                            precise copilot_invoked emitter
  mux_failed                the requested tmux/psmux launch failed closed;
                            creation exhaustion carries attempt count and
                            recoverable=true when the worktree was preserved
  mux_detached              the attach returned -- user detached or session ended
  status_reported           the first status-report (disposition) write in a
                            session -- marks "Copilot did something here"
  changes_pushed            worktree content was pushed to the default branch
  worktree_finalized        finalize completed (content on upstream)
  finalize_skipped_removal  finalize left the worktree/branch/session in place
                            (running inside it, or a live session was detected)
  worktree_reaped           cleanup removed a worktree's dir/branch/session
  handoff_cutover_claim     monitor atomically claimed a pending handoff token
  pane_create_started       programmatic pane/session creation intent was
                            recorded before the mux subprocess was invoked
  handoff_successor_spawn_started
                            successor pane spawn is starting -- emitted before
                            success/failure is known, so a killed spawn still
                            leaves a trace
  handoff_cutover_spawn     live handoff spawned a successor pane (terminal
                            success for the spawn started above)
  handoff_successor_spawn_failed
                            the successor pane spawn (started above) failed
  handoff_predecessor_retire
                            a consumed handoff retired the predecessor pane
  handoff_retire_guard      a retire request was left in place by a safety guard
  claim_added               ``claims add`` journaled a new outbound resource
                            claim (or reopened a finalized worktree via one)
  claim_released            ``claims release`` released or removed a claim
  claim_annotated           ``claims annotate`` updated an existing claim's note
  claim_settled             ``claims settle`` set a claim's terminal
                            disposition (released/at-rest)
  claim_abandoned           ``claims sweep --apply`` flipped an abandoned,
                            provably-gone obligation to at-rest
  claim_at_rest_reconciled  ``claims reconcile-at-rest --apply`` released a
                            lingering at-rest claim
  claim_reclaimed           ``claims cleanup --apply`` reclaimed a re-homed
                            (orphaned) obligation
  claim_handoff_offered     ``claims handoff offer`` created or re-affirmed a
                            same-machine claim-bundle offer
  claim_handoff_accepted    ``claims handoff accept`` transferred a bundle's
                            ownership to the consumer worktree
  claim_handoff_declined    ``claims handoff decline`` marked a bundle declined
  claim_handoff_cancelled   ``claims handoff cancel`` marked a bundle cancelled
  follow_up_added           ``follow-ups add`` journaled a new open follow-up
                            (or reopened a finalized worktree via one)
  follow_up_resolved        ``follow-ups resolve`` marked a follow-up done
  follow_up_dismissed       ``follow-ups dismiss`` marked a follow-up as not
                            requiring action

Unlike the handoff-cutover stages above, the claim/follow-up-ledger events
(``claim_*``, ``follow_up_*``) deliberately do NOT feed ``handoff_trace``'s
unrotated per-worktree store. A claim or follow-up's *current* disposition
already lives durably in its owning ``WorktreeRecord`` YAML -- the gap this
instrumentation closes is *history* (an audit trail of who mutated what and
when), not *truth* (which the YAML already guarantees survives past this
log's 7-day rolling window). See
efforts/2026/08/28 worktree-finality-and-obligations/README.md Phase 7 and
ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3113 for the full rationale.

Every record carries ``worktree_id`` and (where known) ``session_id`` and
``launch_id``. ``launch_id`` is a short correlation token minted once at
launcher entry and threaded through the whole flow (launcher -> mux env ->
session hooks -> post-exit), so ``agent-worktrees activity --launch-id <id>``
returns one launch flow deterministically rather than by timestamp guesswork.

Events recognized in ``HANDOFF_STAGE_MAP`` (see below) additionally carry
``stage`` (1-13, the ordinal position in the handoff cutover lifecycle) and
``stage_name`` (its canonical name), stamped automatically by ``log_event`` --
see efforts/active/handoff-cutover-lifecycle-journal/README.md Phase 1 for the
full 13-stage model this lays the foundation for. This is purely additive:
no existing event name is renamed, so existing readers (health.py's
``find_orphaned_handoffs``, the status monitor's pending-handoff scan) are
unaffected. Every stage-mapped event is also, best-effort, appended to
``handoff_trace``'s durable per-project/per-worktree trace store (Phase 3),
since this rolling log's retention window is too short to "re-trace a
handoff at any time".

Logging must never break the worktree lifecycle: every public function
swallows its own exceptions.
