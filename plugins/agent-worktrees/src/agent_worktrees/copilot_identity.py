"""Ensure Copilot CLI's own inference identity matches an intended account.

Prototype for ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3296. Two identity systems
coexist on a machine: the ``gh`` CLI account (already governed by
``repos.py``'s ``account``/``account_map`` + token-injection) and Copilot
CLI's *own* inference identity, tracked in ``~/.copilot/config.json``
(``lastLoggedInUser``/``loggedInUsers``) and shown at runtime by the
``[managedSettings] self-fetch starting for account ...`` log line. Nothing
enforced the latter before this module.

IMPORTANT -- this is a machine-wide shared identity, not a per-process one.
``~/.copilot/config.json`` is one file every ``copilot.exe`` process on the
machine reads, and live observation confirms an already-running session
picks up a change to it during its own lifetime (its periodic managedSettings
self-fetch reflects the new account within the same process, not just at its
own startup). So switching this file while OTHER Copilot sessions are
already running is not merely uncoordinated -- it can splice a single
already-running session's billing across two accounts mid-flight, invalidate
prompt caching tied to the prior identity, and provoke authentication errors,
all while costing real compute/token spend for no benefit. ``ensure_login``
therefore refuses an actual switch (returns ``other-sessions-active``) when
any other Copilot process is currently running, unless the caller passes
``force=True`` with informed consent. This intentionally still does not try
to *coordinate* with those other sessions (e.g. asking them to re-read
config) -- it only avoids stepping on them silently.

Machine-wide **off by default**: the whole feature is gated behind
``config.yaml``'s ``copilot_identity_switch_enabled`` (see
:func:`switch_enabled`, consulted by the ``copilot-identity ensure`` CLI
dispatch). Deliberately a config-file setting rather than an
environment-variable opt-out, so the choice is durable and visible in the
committed/machine-local config rather than only in a shell's environment.
