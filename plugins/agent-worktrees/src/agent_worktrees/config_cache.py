"""Opt-in memoization for :func:`agent_worktrees.config.load_config`.

Split out of ``config.py`` to keep that module under its module-size baseline
(dotfiles/check-module-size) -- this is a small, self-contained concern, not
part of the config-loading logic itself.

``load_config()``'s control-plane related-PR discovery
(``_control_plane_related_pr_map``) is expensive and uncached -- profiled at
several real seconds per call on a fleet with many registered repos. Most
callers invoke it once per process and that is a reasonable one-time cost,
but some call chains -- notably the Worktree Manager's live picker, which
independently asks for the roster, the profiles-matrix axes, and the
REPO/BRANCH topbar fields from more than one thread and on more than one
occasion in a session (initial live setup, the background pivot prewarm, and
every manual 'r' reload) -- invoke ``load_config()`` many times over a
session, redundantly repeating that discovery every time (observed: 11 calls
in one pass, ~40s total, in a fleet with 15+ registered repos).

Two ways to opt in, same underlying memoization:

- :func:`cached_load_config_scope` -- a quick, single-thread, single-pass
  window for a caller that just wants one point-in-time answer shared across
  a few calls it makes itself, right here, right now.
- :class:`ConfigCacheSession` -- an explicit, caller-owned, TTL-bounded cache
  a caller can hold for as long as it likes (e.g. one Picker launch) and
  enter from *multiple threads*, since it is a plain object reference the
  caller passes around rather than something threaded implicitly. This is
  the "centralized cache" seam for a long-lived, multi-thread consumer: every
  thread that calls ``session.scope()`` shares the same entries, so the
  Picker's async roster-fill thread and its independent pivot-prewarm thread
  (and a later manual reload) all draw on one warm cache instead of each
  paying the discovery cost separately.

Every caller that does not opt in -- the overwhelming majority of
``load_config()`` callers across the CLI -- sees its ordinary always-fresh
behavior, unchanged; this cannot affect existing tests, invalidation
semantics, or a write-then-read call sequence anywhere else in the codebase.
