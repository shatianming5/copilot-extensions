"""Prune-safety triage for worktrees.

Answers one question per worktree, with evidence: **is it safe to prune?**
i.e. is all of its work already on the default branch (or does it hold nothing
worth keeping), so removing the worktree + branch loses no data?

The verdict reconciles three signal sources, in descending order of trust:

1. **Live PR merged-state** (authoritative) -- a ``merged`` PR's content is on
   the default branch by definition.  The local tracking record can go *stale*
   (e.g. an external squash-merge by an automated reviewer leaves a recorded PR
   reading ``open``), so :func:`reconcile_pr_states` refreshes it from the
   provider before assessment.
2. **Git content-on-master** (squash-merge aware) -- ``classify_worktree``
   already proves content landed via ``git cherry``/blob comparison for
   branches that still carry commits.
3. **Session activity** -- a worktree with no commits is only *truly* unused
   when its session held **zero** conversation turns; one that asked a question
   or captured an idea is preserved by default.

This module is intentionally free of I/O for the core assessment
(:func:`assess` is pure); the live lookup is injected as a callable so callers
wire the concrete provider and the assessment stays unit-testable.
