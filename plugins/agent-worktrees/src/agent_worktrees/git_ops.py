def pin_git_credential(repo_path: str | Path, login: str, host: str = "github.com") -> bool:
    """Persist a repo-local git credential pin for ``login`` on ``host``.

    The account resolved at register/clone/adopt time (repos.yaml's
    ``account_map``, an explicit ``account:``, or an authenticated owner
    login) is only advisory to *this* tool's own commands: they inject a
    per-invocation token override (:func:`_auth_config_args`) and never touch
    the repo's actual git config. Any *other* tool that runs a plain ``git
    fetch``/``git pull`` in that checkout (a CI job, an IDE, an unattended
    machine-maintenance task, ...) instead gets whatever account ``gh``'s
    own generic ``credential.https://<host>.helper`` currently considers
    *active* -- which drifts independently of which account this repo
    actually needs and can silently authenticate as the wrong identity
    against a private repo.

    This writes a **local**, repo-scoped override so any plain git client
    resolves the same login this tool already knows is correct, regardless of
    which ``gh`` account happens to be active right now:

        [credential "https://<host>"]
            helper =
            username = <login>
            helper = !f() { if test x$1 = xget; then token=$(gh auth token \\
                --hostname <host> --user '<login>') || exit $?; printf \\
                '%s\\n' "password=$token"; fi; }; f

    The leading empty ``helper =`` resets any inherited (global/system)
    helper list for this exact host before appending the pinned one -- git's
    credential-helper chain is otherwise cumulative across scopes, so without
    the reset the pinned helper would just be appended after (not replace) a
    generic ``gh auth git-credential`` helper that resolves the wrong
    account. That reset, the username write, and the helper append are three
    independent ``git config`` processes; an interprocess lock (keyed on the
    resolved ``--git-dir``) serializes concurrent pins of the same checkout
    (e.g. two registrations/backfills racing) so they can never interleave
    into a helper/username combination pulled from different accounts.

    No-ops (returns ``False``, never raises) when ``repo_path`` is not a git
    working directory, ``login``/``host`` is empty or contains a character
    outside ``[A-Za-z0-9_.-]`` (the helper is a ``!``-prefixed shell script;
    a stray quote/backtick/``$``/separator in either would either break the
    single-quoting around ``login`` or inject a command that runs whenever
    git invokes this helper -- reject rather than attempt to escape), ``gh``
    is not on ``PATH``, or ``login`` **is** the currently active ``gh``
    account. That last case mirrors :func:`_auth_config_args`'s own
    same-account skip (#900): when the login is already active, the
    inherited default credential helper (GCM, a vault-backed helper, ...)
    already authenticates correctly, and forcing it to a ``gh auth
    token``-backed helper here could turn a working plain push into a 403
    if that OAuth token happens to lack push scope -- callers treat this as
    a best-effort convenience, not a required step.
