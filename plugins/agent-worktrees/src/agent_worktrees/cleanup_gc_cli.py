    Reloads the tracking record fresh, rebuilds a single-worktree
    ``active_paths``, re-classifies git state fresh (no network fetch),
    re-derives ``turn_count``, and runs the complete (ordering-fixed)
    :func:`prune.cleanup_disposition` -- never a narrowed dirty/active-only
    check. Returns a :class:`RevalidationResult` carrying the fresh
    ``record``/``info`` the caller must reap, not the caller's stale pre-lock
    objects.

    **Two named contracts** (Phase 2):

    - **Non-forced** (default): re-checks the complete disposition --
      dirty/WIP/conversation/held-claims/follow-up/paired-pending/branch-merge
      (for a missing directory) -- via the *ordering-fixed*
      ``cleanup_disposition``, in addition to liveness. When ``reap`` is
      given and the fresh decision is cleanable, this acquires
      ``tracking._RecordLock(yaml_path, require_sidecar=True)`` and invokes
      ``reap`` **while continuing to hold it**, so the fresh read and the
      delete happen as one uninterrupted, lock-held sequence (Option 1(b)):
      a racing write from this codebase's OTHER record mutators (resource
      claims, follow-ups, session registration -- all of which already take
      the same sidecar lock for their own RMW) is fenced out for the whole
      window, not just the read. ``require_sidecar=True`` means lock
      contention **fails closed** (raises ``TimeoutError``, reported as the
      ``"locked"`` bucket) rather than degrading to the in-process-only
      lock. Callers must already hold ``FinalizeLock`` before calling this
      (lock order: ``FinalizeLock`` then ``_RecordLock`` -- never reversed).
    - **Forced** (`force=True`): mirrors ``reap_one --force``'s documented,
      narrower escape hatch -- skips ``cleanup_disposition`` entirely (dirty/
      WIP/claims/follow-ups/branch-merge are NOT re-checked), but still
      refreshes liveness fresh, under the lock, via the *same* liveness-read
      code path as the non-forced contract (closing the gap where ``--force``
      used to trust a stale pre-lock ``active_paths`` snapshot). The one
      check ``--force`` never bypasses is an active/hosted session. Forced
      mode does not take ``_RecordLock`` -- its narrower contract isn't
      gated on the fields other writers mutate.

    A worktree with no on-disk path (``GONE``) re-proves the branch-merged
    gate itself (``cleanup_disposition`` deliberately excludes ``GONE`` --
    that proof is caller-owned), so a branch that became unmerged after an
    earlier, caller-side pre-lock proof is still caught here.

    This function never performs a network PR reconciliation -- ``rec.prs``
    is read as already reconciled at scan time (or not reconciled at all, in
    which case a stale ``open`` fails safe toward "don't reap").

    """Garbage-collect this project's worktrees on this machine.

    One command, three sweeps, then a prune:

      1. **Claim-history mirror sync** (opt-in, ``--mirror-claim-history``)
         -- pushes every locally-recorded, not-yet-mirrored
         :mod:`claim_history` event (``refs/agent-worktrees/claim-history/v1``,
         same shared store as the lease refs) to its own append-only remote
         ref, so PR ownership history survives this machine's own cleanup
         instead of evaporating with it (worktree-claims-transitive-finalization
         Phase 3b). Deliberately runs FIRST, before any reap/sweep step
         below can delete the tracking records a legacy (unstamped) event's
         eligibility falls back to. Stateless, idempotent, and a silent
         no-op when no store is configured.
      2. **Tracked reap** -- the same prune-safety verdict as ``cleanup``
         (finalized/merged/clean; ``--include-unused`` / ``--include-conversations``
         widen it). Never touches a dirty / ahead / follow-up / active / system
         worktree. ``--dry-run`` lists without removing.
      3. **Managed (system/bridge) sweep** -- reaps *leaked* daemon-owned
         worktrees that routine cleanup skips: only the provably dead ones
         (FINAL or UNUSED, no active mux/session/attach, no follow-up, idle past
         the grace window). Skip with ``--no-managed`` (#1069).
      4. **Orphan-directory sweep** -- removes *effectively-empty* on-disk
         directories under the worktree roots that are neither a registered git
         worktree nor a tracking record (leftovers from interrupted/forced
         removals), with a locked-directory retry/skip; a leftover holding real
         files is reported, never auto-deleted.
      5. **Orphaned launcher-shell reap** -- terminates pwsh/python
         ``-m agent_worktrees`` scaffolding stranded by a force-closed terminal
         (parent exited, nothing live under it, idle past the grace window).
         Service-safe (positive launcher-signature only). Skip with
         ``--no-reap-shells`` (copilot-extensions #102).
      6. ``git worktree prune`` to drop stale registrations.
      7. **Lease-ref squash** (opt-in, ``--lease-gc``) -- collapses each
         RELEASED cross-machine lease ref (``refs/agent-worktrees/leases/v1``)
         past ``--lease-retention-days`` (default 30) to a minimal 2-commit
         history, so its per-acquire/renew/release chain stops growing
         forever. Never deleted, never touches a live/stale ``leased`` ref.
         Network + force-push to the lease store; skipped entirely unless
         ``--lease-gc`` is passed, and a silent no-op (not an error) when no
         lease store is configured for this project.

    Idempotent: a second run right after the first finds nothing to do.

    ``--json`` reports the managed + orphan + shell + lease + claim-history
    mirror sweeps (machine-readable); the tracked reap runs in text mode.
