"""Wire customizing-copilot's ``render-local-cache`` CLI into the worktree
lifecycle boundaries this pattern depends on: create, resume, and
``sessionStart`` (a backup for drift accrued since).

See ``docs/patterns/worktree-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`` and
``efforts/2026/10/02 ambient-guidance-navigability`` Phase 7. This is the
*consumer* side of a mechanism ``customizing-copilot`` owns entirely:
``instruction_projections.render_local_cache()`` and the sibling-resolution/
declaration schema it depends on all live in that plugin's own
``skills/reviewing-customizations/scripts/``. Per
``docs/patterns/a-la-carte-independence.md``'s "no cross-plugin
reach-around" rule, this module never imports that plugin's Python package
or assumes its internal layout beyond locating its own declared,
versioned CLI entry point (``manage-instruction-projections.py``'s
``render-local-cache`` operation) -- it invokes that payload-local script
across a process boundary (a bounded-timeout subprocess).

Per ``docs/patterns/marketplace-installation-cells.md``'s "plugin name
alone never selects a runtime" invariant, the sibling's root is resolved
through ``plugin_activation.resolve_active_plugins()`` -- the same
identity-verified active-plugin evidence ``claim_providers.py`` uses for
its own sibling callbacks -- never by trusting a directory merely because
it contains a ``plugin.json`` self-declaring the expected name. Only the
plugin's **global** activation scope is ever trusted -- never a project-
scoped override, which the resolver aggregates from every agent-worktrees-
registered project and could otherwise supply an unrelated project's
locally-overridden copy of customizing-copilot to a session in a
different repo entirely. Missing or ambiguous provenance (zero, or more
than one, matching active plugin) fails closed: no script is resolved,
and the refresh is silently skipped for that round.

That resolution call itself runs in its own bounded subprocess (``python
-m agent_worktrees.local_cache_refresh <home>``, this module's own
entry point below) -- never in-process, and never on a bare Python
thread -- because ``resolve_active_plugins()`` can spawn Git child
processes verifying registered projects; only a real process-tree kill
(``push_timeout.run_bounded``, the same mechanism the render step uses)
can guarantee those descendants don't outlive a timeout. A thread's own
``join(timeout)`` cannot cancel work already in flight inside it, so it
can only abandon the wait, never the underlying Git children.

Every entry point here is deliberately best-effort and silent: customizing-
copilot not being installed, the repo not yet being a trusted folder, a
subprocess timeout, or any other failure are all absorbed rather than
raised. This is a convenience refresh at a lifecycle boundary, never a gate
on create/resume/sessionStart succeeding.
