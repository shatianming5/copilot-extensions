"""Claim-provider drop-in registry (claim-provider-pattern effort).

``agent-worktrees`` owns the claims ledger (``claims add|release|settle|
sweep|mirror-status|cleanup|orphans``), but several claimable resource kinds
-- a CodeSpace, a container, a dispatch task -- are actually owned by
higher-tier siblings in the suite's plugin stack (agent-codespaces,
agent-containers, agent-dispatch). Rather than agent-worktrees hardcoding a
call to each sibling's CLI (an **upward** call, forbidden by the plugin-stack
layering rule -- see ``docs/patterns/a-la-carte-independence.md``), a
claim-owning plugin registers as a **claim provider**: it ships a small
drop-in manifest declaring the claim **namespace** it serves (the ``<prefix>:``
of a namespaced claim ref, e.g. ``codespace:``) and one or both **callback**
argv templates agent-worktrees invokes on demand.

This mirrors the existing cross-plugin **pivot** registry
(:mod:`agent_worktrees.picker_support.pivot_manifest`) and **claim-kind**
registry (:mod:`agent_worktrees.claim_kinds_registry`) already used elsewhere
in this same plugin: a contributing plugin drops a static template at
``<plugin_root>/claim-providers/<namespace>.json`` in its own payload (no
sessionStart hook, no separate registration step -- the manifest ships with
the plugin's own installed version and is always current). agent-worktrees
scans the installed-plugins tree directly, verifies the contributing plugin's
identity via ``plugin_activation.resolve_active_plugins()``, and resolves each
declared command to the plugin's own **payload-local** binstub
(``<plugin_root>/bin/<command>[.cmd]``) -- never an ambient ``PATH`` lookup of
a higher-tier sibling, matching the marketplace-scoped-installations Phase 2
payload-local-invocation policy.

Manifest schema (``<plugin_root>/claim-providers/<namespace>.json``)::

    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "namespace": "codespace",              # required: the claim-ref prefix
      "status_command": ["agent-codespaces"],  # optional: see below
      "reclaim_command": ["agent-codespaces"], # optional: see below
      "description": "GitHub Codespaces"       # optional: human label
    }

At least one of ``status_command``/``reclaim_command`` is required. Callback
contract (invoked with the claim ref's bare identifier, namespace prefix
already stripped):

* ``<status_command...> claim-status <ref>`` -> a JSON object on stdout, at
  minimum ``{"exists": bool}``; optional ``"state"``/``"detail"`` strings.
  Any parse failure, non-zero exit, or timeout degrades to
  ``{"available": False, "reason": "..."}"`` -- never raises.
* ``<reclaim_command...> claim-reclaim <ref> [--apply]`` -> a JSON object,
  at minimum ``{"reclaimed": bool}``; optional ``"detail"``. Without
  ``--apply`` the provider must not act (dry-run preview only), matching
  agent-worktrees' own ``claims cleanup`` dry-run-by-default convention.

A missing, absent, or malformed provider manifest degrades only that one
namespace's status/reclaim resolution -- never any of agent-worktrees' own
claims commands, exactly like the pivot and claim-kind registries.

#: ever runs (review finding: "Align reclaim timeout with full recovery
#: and deletion phases" -- an earlier revision of this constant summed
#: only the pull+delete phases, undercounting boot and the (then-
#: unbounded) push step). 180 + 300 + 60 + 60 = 600s of phase budget;

    validates its own ref via :func:`split_namespaced_ref`). This is the
    preferred entry point over calling :func:`resolve_provider_argv`
    directly and appending tokens by hand -- it makes the same
    :func:`is_safe_argument` validation structural rather than something
    each caller must remember to apply itself.

    Each item in ``extra`` is an explicit ``(token, trusted)`` pair --
    ``trusted=True`` for a static/literal subcommand name or flag the call
    site itself wrote into source (e.g. ``"delete"``, ``"--force"``,
    ``"--machine"``), ``trusted=False`` for anything derived from
    persisted/external data (a CodeSpace name, a machine/worktree id, ...).
    Deliberately explicit rather than inferring trust from a leading ``-``:
    a real call site's argv interleaves static flags AND untrusted values
    (e.g. ``--worktree <worktree_id>``), so a leading-dash heuristic would
    both let an untrusted value that happens to start with ``-`` (e.g. a
    crafted ``--apply``) through unvalidated, and is simply the wrong axis
    -- "starts with -" has nothing to do with "did this call site write it
    as a literal". Every ``trusted=False`` token is validated with
    :func:`is_safe_argument` regardless of its own content, INCLUDING a
    leading dash.

    Returns ``None`` when no provider is registered, it declares no command
    of the requested ``kind``, OR any ``trusted=False`` token fails

    ``agent-worktrees`` ships with ``installationContext: required``
    (``payload-invocation.json``), so ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT`` is
    present on EVERY real invocation, not just some rare namespaced-cell
    edge case -- an earlier revision of this helper refused outright
    whenever that variable was set, which silently disabled this entire
    registry in every normal marketplace installation (a strictly worse
    outcome than the residual risk below).

    This path now exists only for callers with NO explicit installation
    context at all. When ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT`` is present and the
    sibling is a registered peer-launch target, the caller must rebind into
    the peer's own validated context instead of stripping and downgrading.

    Strips ``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT``, ``COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT``, AND
    ``GH_TOKEN``/``GITHUB_TOKEN`` before the child inherits any of them
    unchanged. The sibling's own installation-context resolution (e.g.
    ``agent_codespaces.worktrees.explicit_context()``) treats an ABSENT
    context as "not in cell mode" and falls back to its legacy/ambient
    resolution path -- a supported, non-erroring mode, not a refusal --
    but leaving the CALLER's own cell-scoped ``GH_TOKEN``/``GITHUB_TOKEN``
    in place would let that legacy fallback still authenticate as the
    WRONG cell's identity. Properly rebinding to the target's OWN
    validated cell context (mirroring each provider plugin's private
    peer-launch mechanism, e.g. ``agent_codespaces._peer_launch``) would
    be strictly better, but is real future work this registry cannot
    safely approximate from the caller's side alone -- this bounded
    stripping closes the concrete credential-leak risk without disabling
    the feature entirely.

    Returns ``None`` (inherit the ambient environment completely
    unmodified) only when this process carries none of these variables set
    at all -- checked by simple presence, NOT by :meth:`str.strip`, matching
    ``agent_codespaces.worktrees.explicit_context()``'s own fail-closed
    presence check: a whitespace-only value is still an explicit (if
    invalid) context there, not an absent one, so it must still be
