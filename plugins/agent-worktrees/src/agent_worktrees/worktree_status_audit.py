"""Periodic ground-truth audit for the worktree-status accelerator
(agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator effort, Phase 7 -- ongoing
accuracy monitoring).

Once other consumers (the Tasks-board card, this effort's own in-process
reference consumer, a future cross-venv one) rely on the accelerator's
cache for their whole picture of a worktree, a silent drift between what
the cache reports and reality would be invisible until an operator noticed
something felt wrong. This module gives that drift a signal: read the
durable cache's own snapshot, independently recompute a sample of the same
worktrees via :func:`worktree_status_compute.compute` (bypassing the cache
entirely -- the same ground truth :mod:`worktree_status_compute` itself is),
diff the two, and append one structured JSON line per run to a local log so
an operator (or `worktree-status-audit`'s own exit code, scriptable by a
scheduled task) has both a live check and a durable trail of the
accelerator's refresh cadence and liveness over time.

Never raises past :func:`run_audit`: a per-worktree audit failure is
recorded as that entry's own ``error``, never lets one bad worktree abort
the whole run; telemetry-log write failures are swallowed (best-effort,
same durability posture as the cache's own SQLite writes).

Deliberately imports :mod:`worktree_status_daemon` lazily inside the
functions that need it, never at module scope: this module is imported
eagerly by ``__main__.py`` (for its CLI alias), and the daemon module pulls
in the vendored ``work_coalescing_singleton`` package, which not every
environment importing ``agent_worktrees.__main__`` has installed --
mirrors ``__main__.py``'s own ``cmd_status_monitor`` and
``session_tracking_cli.cmd_worktree_status_bundle``, which do the same.

    recently (see `cmd_status_monitor`'s own empty-strike logic) -- a bare
    probe with no boot path would then report "unresponsive" for a
    perfectly healthy accelerator that simply hasn't been asked about
    anything in a while, which is not a fault; it is *this exact system's
    own resting state* between callers, and every real caller already
    tolerates it via ``ensure_monitor``. Using the same path here means a
    finding actually means what it says: the accelerator failed a real
    consumer's own request, not merely "no one had asked recently".

    ``probe``, when given a real ``(project, worktree_id)`` pair, is what
    makes this call meaningfully answerable at all -- without one (nothing
    to probe with, an empty population), this still gives an idle-exited
    monitor the same boot-and-wait chance to come back (when
    ``ensure_monitor`` is available) before taking a static snapshot, but
    never reports ``responsive=False`` for it: without a real request
    there is nothing to have actually failed, only "no one to ask", so
    this always reports ``responsive=None`` rather than treating an
    absent/resting monitor as an outage.

    ``boot_wait_s``, when given, overrides the wait window used for both
    branches above (default: ``worktree_status_daemon.BOOT_WAIT_S``) --
    a pure testability knob so a test can exercise a real poll loop
    without paying the full production wait; production callers never
    need to pass it.
