"""Finalization flow -- push-changes and validate-and-finalize with locking.

Two-phase worktree completion:

Phase 1 -- push_changes():
  1. Acquire lock
  2. Fetch from remote
  3. Pre-squash all worktree commits into one
  4. Rebase the single commit onto upstream
  5. Validate core files (config-driven hooks)
  6. Anchor hygiene check (block on dirty, warn on stash)
  7. Update local default branch and fast-forward merge
  8. Push with retry
  9. Update tracking status to "pushed"

Phase 2 -- validate_and_finalize():
  1. Non-mutating check: is the branch content already on origin/master?
     The worktree's commit must be in origin/master's history (or be
     equal to origin/master) for the worktree to be considered safe to
     prune.
  2. If yes: the worktree is finalized. Merge permissions and update
     tracking to "finalized". The worktree's branch and directory are
     removed *only* when nothing is using them -- i.e. no live Copilot
     session and the current shell is not inside the worktree. When a
     session is still live (the common case, since users typically run
     "finalize" from inside their session), the git branch and the
     folder are intentionally left in place for a later cleanup; this is
     normal, not an error.
  3. If no: error with guidance to run push-changes first

"finalize" never deletes a worktree out from under a running session and
never force-removes the directory. Its job is to guarantee the branch's
work is merged to master; directory/branch pruning is a separate,
deferred concern handled by cleanup once the worktree is idle.

    A dev-slot claim (see ``libs/versioned-runtime``'s mutable-dev-slot
    pattern) is a plain ``<root>/dev-claim.json`` sidecar a plugin installer
    writes next to its ``current-version`` marker when a worktree opts a
    plugin's local install into the shared, mutable ``dev`` slot. Its schema
    is a small, stable, dependency-free JSON shape
    (``copilot-extensions.dev-slot-claim``) specifically so a reader never
    needs to import or shell out to the owning plugin's own runtime --
    marketplace-isolation, same posture as the CodeSpace-claim warning above,
    just satisfied by reading a plain file instead of calling a sibling
    plugin's binstub. Every plugin's root lives at ``~/.<plugin-name>/`` by
    convention, so this scans every such directory rather than hardcoding a
    plugin list -- a plugin that adopts the pattern later needs no change
    here.

    Matches on the full worktree checkout path (the same value
    ``agent-codespaces``' CodeSpace claims use as ``owner``), not the short
    ``worktree_id`` -- a dev-slot claim's ``owner`` is written by the
    installer from ``agent-worktrees get worktree-dir``, which returns the

    A worktree answers for the outbound resources it still owns before it may

    any unsettled resource **refuses** finalize unless ``abandon`` carries an

    diagnostics, but cannot release creator responsibility.

    ``abandon`` overrides a block only with a non-empty ``handoff_to`` recipient

    ``release_all_resources`` marks the claims released and surfaces them for
    the named cleanup/adoption flow). Returns True to proceed, False to block
    the finalize. Degrade-safe: no record / no resources -> proceed.

    Finalize never auto-reclaims a creator's children. A crashed/missed
