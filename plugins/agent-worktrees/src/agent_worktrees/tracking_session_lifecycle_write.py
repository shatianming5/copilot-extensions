"""``session_conclude``/``session_link_succession`` verbs.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 3 -- the fourth
migrated call-site cluster: the two dedicated ground-layer session-
lifecycle write commands (``conclude-session``/``link-succession``,
previously inline in ``session_tracking_cli.py``). Both are clean,
single-worktree, single-lock transactions with no ``activity.log_event``
and no ambient-context reads -- the simplest cluster yet, deliberately
picked over the same module's (``tracking_lifecycle.py``) riskier call
sites still embedded in bigger orchestrated flows:

- ``terminal_conclusion.py``'s ``_save_session_conclusion`` -- one step
  inside the disposable-worktree conclusion cascade's own single lock, not
  a standalone transaction of its own.
- ``register_session``'s own internal ``link_handoff`` call
  (``tracking_session_registry.py``) -- embedded in the sessionStart-hook-
  critical path, the same risk class the effort's original guidance told
  this migration to avoid for an early verb.

See the effort README's own Journal for the full survey.

The fifth cluster (this same PR) reuses ``apply_session_conclude`` for
``handoff_cutover.py``'s ``_conclude_retired_predecessor`` repair via the
``only_if_active`` guard above, rather than registering a new verb for it
-- both wrap the identical ``tracking.conclude_session`` transaction, only
differing in whether an already-non-active entry is a silent no-op
(repair) or unconditionally reasserted (the public CLI command).

Both commands are "project-agnostic" (``_find_tracking_file`` searches
every project, since a higher-layer caller's CWD is unrelated to the
target worktree) -- the resolved ``yaml_path`` is already correct
regardless of ambient project, so unlike ``status_disposition_write``
there is no cross-project scoping concern to thread through here either.

    the retroactive-registration repair for issue #4557: a terminal
    (``kind`` in ``tracking.MANAGED_KINDS``, ``status`` finalized/complete/
    completed) worktree whose pending handoff was actually consumed by a
    real successor session that was never ``register-session``'d (a
    crash/race in that step), leaving the record wedged forever in gc's
    ``recheck-record-changed`` bucket (``pending_handoffs``/

    Deliberately its OWN verb rather than relaxing ``session_register``'s
    terminal-and-managed gate: that gate protects the sessionStart-hook-
    critical path shared by every live session launch, and this is a
    one-shot closing/reconciling edit on an already-dead worktree, not a
    new activation. Scoped tightly to that exact class -- refuses on a

    ``link-succession`` path already covers those) and on anything but a
    still-``pending`` handoff naming an already-tracked predecessor and a

    session transcript whose recorded cwd matches this worktree) BEFORE
    calling this verb -- this transaction only re-validates the tracking-
    record-side invariants under the lock, since the evidence check reads a
    different store (session-state) that this record lock does not cover.
    ``expected_worktree_path`` is the ``record.worktree_path`` the caller's
    cwd check actually verified against; re-checked here under the lock so a
    concurrent record repair/move between that unlocked read and this
    dispatch can't register/conclude a session against a worktree_path that
