"""Claimant-liveness resolution for resource-claims reap-safety.

A worktree created as another worktree's outbound resource carries an
``owner_ref`` (``machine/project/worktree_id[#session]``). Before a prune/GC
sweep reclaims such a resource it must answer: **is the owning worktree still
alive?** -- honoring the agent-fabric behavior ``claimed-resource-not-reclaimed``
(a resource with a live, or not-confirmed-gone, claimant is never reclaimed;
absence of a *local* owner is never proof of no owner).

Two layers:

* :func:`local_claimant_alive` -- the **same-machine** resolver: does the
  owner's tracking record + worktree directory still exist *on this machine*?
  Returns ``None`` for a cross-machine owner (it cannot see that machine).
* :func:`resolve_claimant_alive` -- the **fabric** resolver used by the reaper:
  same-machine goes local; a cross-machine owner is probed over the SSH mesh by
  running this same check *on the owner's machine* (which resolves it locally
  there). Any failure/timeout degrades to ``None`` (spare), so the network is
  never allowed to turn "unknown" into "reclaim".

The tri-state contract everywhere: ``True`` = alive (spare), ``None`` =
unconfirmed (spare), ``False`` = confirmed gone (reclaimable).
