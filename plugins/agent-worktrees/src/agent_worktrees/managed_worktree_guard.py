"""Removal-safety guard for managed (``system``/``bridge``) worktrees.

``remove-system`` used to unconditionally force-remove a managed worktree --
no check for uncommitted changes, unmerged/unpushed branch content, an open
PR, or a live outbound resource claim. This module is the guard that closes
that gap, split out from ``__main__.py`` to keep this repo's per-module
line-count cap honest (see ``tools/check-module-size.py``) rather than
growing an already very large file further.
