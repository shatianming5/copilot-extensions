"""``session_register`` verb.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 3 -- the seventh
migrated call-site cluster, and the first ever taken from the
sessionStart-hook-critical path: ``tracking_session_registry.register_session``
itself (previously inline). Every earlier cluster deliberately avoided this
exact function -- Phase 2's own plan named it the highest-risk case, and
Phase 3's fourth cluster's design survey again deferred it, both times for
the same reason: any bug here breaks session registration for every single
worktree session, not just one CLI command.

Landed now (operator direction, 2026-09-27) because six clusters already
proved the verb-migration template end-to-end, AND because the alternative
considered first -- extracting only the function's internal ``link_handoff``
call as a narrower verb -- does not actually reduce risk. That call is one
conditional branch inside a single, deeply interdependent transaction
(resource-claim add, session-activation state, conditional handoff-linking
OR head-transition/pending-handoff cancellation, all sharing one
``_RecordLock``, with the function's own return value depending on which
branch fires) -- pulling only the branch out would split one atomic write
into two, which is a real regression, not a simplification. Verb-ifying the
WHOLE transaction, as this module does, keeps the atomicity guarantee intact
and is the same shape every other cluster already uses.

**Latency, not just correctness, is the operative constraint here** (the
reason the call site below passes ``boot_wait_s=0`` rather than the default
4s): a sessionStart hook runs synchronously in the path of every session
launch. ``tracking_write.write_with_boot``'s boot-wait exists to give a
*freshly spawned* daemon a few seconds to come up before falling back --
appropriate for an explicit CLI command a human or agent is already waiting
on, never for a hook that blocks the interactive session itself. Passing
``boot_wait_s=0`` still fires ``ensure_monitor()`` (a non-blocking
``subprocess.Popen`` spawn, warming the daemon for the *next* session) but
never spin-waits for it: an already-warm daemon is dialed immediately (the
overwhelmingly common case, since the resident monitor is normally kept
running continuously once started); a cold/unreachable one falls straight
through to the identical in-process code with no added wait at all,
matching this function's pre-migration latency exactly.

Any ambient-context read the original inline transaction needed (project,
tracking dir) was ALREADY resolved by the caller before entering its own
lock (``tracking._owning_tracking_dir(worktree_id)``, computed once at the
top of the pre-migration function) -- so this migration required no new
caller-side resolution, unlike verbs whose pre-migration call sites read
ambient config from inside their own locked block.
