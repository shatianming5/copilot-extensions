    Merges these tiers (highest precedence wins):

    1. ``~/.<project>/config.yaml`` (machine-local; ``path``) -- per-machine,
       per-repo overrides and machine paths. **Optional**: a repo designed for
       this system carries its settings in-repo and needs no machine-local
       file; machine-local config is the adapter that makes *foreign* repos
       compatible.
    1b. **Knowledge overlay (E1e, #947)** -- for a **stateless harness** bound to
       a knowledge repo, the knowledge repo's ``config.yaml`` contributes portable
       **operator-preference** keys (``copilot_profiles``/``headless``/
       ``auto_fast_forward``) as a tier BETWEEN the in-repo base and
       machine-local, so those prefs can be versioned in the knowledge repo while
       machine-local stays minimal. Machine-specifics + the binding never graft;
       ``{}`` (no effect) for a normal repo.
    2. ``<anchor>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/config.yaml`` (in-repo;
       the repo's own committed config -- the base for its settings), with
       legacy fallback to ``<anchor>/.agent-worktrees/config.yaml`` and
       ``<anchor>/.agent-worktrees.yaml`` plus an explicit marketplace overlay
       at
       ``<anchor>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/marketplaces/<marketplace-id>/config.yaml``.
    3. ``~/.agent-worktrees/config.yaml`` (global; machine-wide defaults).

    Top-level fields (``srcroot``/``machine``/``platform``/``copilot_profiles``
    /``headless``/``auto_fast_forward``) resolve machine-local > global >
    detected -- with the knowledge overlay inserted just under machine-local for
    the portable operator-preference keys only. Per-repo settings merge in-repo
    flat settings < machine-local ``repos.<name>`` block (the global tier carries
    no per-repo settings). Anchors come from the machine-local file or, when
    absent, from ``~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml``.

    Args:
        path: Machine-local config path. Uses the default if None.
        include_control_plane_related_pr: Include foreign-repo PR overlays from
            active harness plugins. Related-index bootstrap disables this to
            avoid resolving the same active-plugin corpus twice.
        project: Explicit project identity. When supplied, it overrides legacy
            machine/global ``repo_name`` values for this load.

    Returns:
        Parsed Config object.
