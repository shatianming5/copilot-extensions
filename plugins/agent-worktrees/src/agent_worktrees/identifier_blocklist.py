"""Pluggable identifier-blocklist sweep.

Discovers and aggregates ``block-for-<tier>.yaml`` denylists from every
locally registered repo (``~/.agent-worktrees/repos.yaml``), scoped to a
*target* repo's own audience-exposure tier (``RepoEntry.visibility``).

## The convention

Any registered repo may carry a ``.identifier-blocklist/`` directory at its
anchor root, checked into the repo itself (not machine-local -- so it
travels with a fork/clone, like the rest of that repo's own capability).
Inside it, one file per exposure tier it wants to protect against:

- ``block-for-internal.yaml`` -- terms that must never appear in a repo
  whose own ``visibility`` is ``internal`` or more exposed (``public`` too).
- ``block-for-public.yaml`` -- terms that must never appear in a repo whose
  own ``visibility`` is ``public``.

There is deliberately no ``block-for-private.yaml``: nothing is more exposed
than ``private``, so such a file could never apply to any *other* repo, and
a repo never needs to protect itself from its own content.

## File schema

```yaml
entries:
  - token: legacy-system
    reason: Internal org/repo name -- use a generic product placeholder

  - token: '\bSPO\b'
    kind: regex
    reason: Standalone internal abbreviation -- use a generic service placeholder

  - token: ABC
    whole_word: true
    case_sensitive: true
    reason: Case-sensitive acronym for a private repo -- refer to it generically
```

Each entry under the top-level ``entries:`` list is a mapping:

- ``token`` (required) -- the literal substring, or (when ``kind: regex``) a
  Python regular-expression fragment.
- ``kind`` -- ``literal`` (default) or ``regex``. A ``literal`` token matches
  as a plain, case-insensitive substring unless ``whole_word``/
  ``case_sensitive`` below promote it to a regex internally.
- ``whole_word`` -- wrap the token in ``\b...\b`` boundaries (auto-escaping a
  literal token first). Use this instead of hand-writing a regex for the
  common "don't flag this as a substring of another word" case.
- ``case_sensitive`` -- match this token's exact case only (scoped with an
  inline ``(?-i:...)`` group so the rest of the pattern, and every other
  entry, stays case-insensitive).
- ``reason`` (optional) -- explains why the token is forbidden and names the
  generic replacement to use instead.

Internally, each parsed entry still resolves to the same ``token``/
``regex:<pattern>`` representation
``tools/check-no-internal-identifiers.py``'s CI-secret source has always
used, via :func:`render_ci_format` -- so a consumer reading the aggregated
sweep output needs no format awareness of this module's own YAML source.

## Why this lives in agent-worktrees, not a single consuming repo

Any repo that registers an audience-exposure ``visibility`` and wants its
pre-push/CI guard sourced from a live, cross-repo sweep rather than a
hand-maintained copy can call :func:`sweep` (or the ``identifiers sweep``
CLI) -- this is the centralized, pluggable half of the mechanism; a
consuming repo's own guard script (or this plugin's own pre-push hook) is
the enforcement half.
