"""Git-collaboration primitives -- the invariant-bearing operations that sit
below the high-level push-changes/create-pr/finalize lifecycle and above raw

- :func:`sync_forward` -- pull the worktree branch forward onto the updated

- :func:`manage_feature_branch` -- create/update, push, or sync a durable shared
  feature branch (host publishes; delegates sync).
- :func:`merge_to_feature` -- rebase the worktree branch onto a shared feature
  branch and ff-merge + push it (the delegate handoff).

# several agent-bridge agents build on for one effort.  It is distinct from the
# local-only ``worktree/<id>`` base and from the per-worktree ``feature/<slug>``
# branch that ``create-pr`` derives.  The worktree always stays on its own
# ``worktree/<id>`` branch; the shared feature branch is manipulated as a ref via
# fetch / ``git branch -f`` / push, never checked out into the worktree.
#
# Ownership: every delegate may **ff-push** its slice to the shared feature
# branch (that is the handoff).  Only the **host** opens PRs from it.  No one
# force-pushes it.
