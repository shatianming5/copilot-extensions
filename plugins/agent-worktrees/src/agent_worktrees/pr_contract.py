"""Provider-neutral PR event/verdict contract for the ``pr-*`` command family.

This is the single **pure** seam that ``pr-watch`` (transition events) and
``pr-status`` (glance verdict / conflict / merge state) both build on.  It
unifies the pure cores of the two multi-machine system tools -- ``tools/pr-watch`` (the
transition diff + cursor) and ``tools/pr-consent`` (the head-aware verdict
reduction + consent eligibility) -- into one place so the family speaks one
vocabulary regardless of provider.

Design constraints that keep it a *contract*, not an implementation:

- **No network.**  Every function is a pure transform of its inputs; the
  provider fetches a :class:`PRSnapshot` and hands it in.
- **No config import.**  The multi-machine system binding (auto-merge label, hold labels, WIP
  title prefixes) is passed in as explicit arguments, so this module never
  couples to ``config`` or a specific hosting service.  Binding-absent (empty
  arguments) degrades cleanly -- no holds, no WIP, verdict/mergeability still
  classify.
- **Stdlib only.**  No new dependency.

The heavier machinery -- polling a provider, the CLI surface, moving the
multi-machine system tools onto this seam -- lands in later phases of the
``pr-command-family`` effort.  Phase 1 ships only this contract + its tests.

      worktree to the default branch; the pr-* verbs do not apply.
    - **pr-agent-merge** (enabled + an ``automerge_label`` is bound): the author
      signals **merge consent** with that label after approval, and the review
      gate merges. The full pr-* family applies -- this is the multi-machine system's own
      auto-review + auto-merge shape.
    - **pr-human-merge** (enabled but **no** ``automerge_label``): PR-gated, but
      the agent has no consent/merge mechanism -- a **human** approves and
      merges. ``create-pr`` / ``pr-watch`` / ``pr-status`` / ``pr-complete``
      apply; **``pr-merge`` does not** (there is no consent label to apply).

    The absence of ``automerge_label`` is the human-merge signal *by design*.
    The one ambiguity a caller must resolve out-of-band: an ``enabled`` repo
    that *should* have an ``automerge_label`` but is missing it because the
    checkout's anchor is stale looks identical to a genuine human-merge repo.
    Callers that expect agent-merge (e.g. the multi-machine system) should confirm the
    anchor is current before treating an empty label as "human-merge".

    A fourth shape, **pr-self-merge**: submitter merges directly (no consent
    label) when ``self_approve`` or ``merge_actor == "submitter-direct"``;
    ``review_blocking`` gates only the tooling -- a repo's verdict policy still applies.

# PR-flow reminders -- state-aware "rules + next step" guidance per repo
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A reminder is a **stay-on-the-rails** aid: every pr-* / push-changes verb, on
# BOTH its success and its error/refusal path, tells the calling agent where it
# is, which states are allowed next, and which *sanctioned agent-worktrees verb*
# to use next. It is deliberately a pure transform of a PRFlowProfile (+ the
# verb, the coarse PR state, and whether the command succeeded).
#
# HARD INVARIANT -- no bypass tactics. A reminder MUST NEVER steer an agent to a
# tool that goes around this flow: no raw provider CLI (`gh pr merge`, `gh api`,
# `az repos`), no force/override flags (`--force`, `--admin`, `--no-verify`), no
# direct REST calls. Even though an agent may have general permission to run
# those, the reminder's whole job is to keep work ON the reviewed rails, so it
# only ever names agent-worktrees verbs and the sanctioned flow. A refusal says
# what to do *within* the rules (wait, watch, let the reviewer merge), never how
# to skip them. This invariant is enforced by ``test_pr_contract`` (a token
# scan over every reminder's rendered text).

#: Coarse PR states a verb may know it is in (from a snapshot, or "" when
#: unknown). The reminder tailors "next" / "waiting on" to these.
