"""Public-safe codename generation for worktrees (effort:
``pr-attribution-codenames``, issue #2838).

A codename is a short, branch/filename-safe handle assigned to a worktree so
a public PR marker (or, historically, a leaked branch name) can carry a
lookup key without decoding any machine/worktree/session/timestamp
information. Two sources of a handle:

- **Built-in generator** -- a small, organization-neutral word list shipped
  with this plugin. Deliberately whimsical but *not* themed after any
  product, franchise, or brand: this is a general-purpose public plugin
  (see CONTRIBUTING.md's contribution boundary), so the *default* vocabulary
  stays neutral. A control repo wanting its own flavor uses a wordlist file
  (below) instead.
- **External wordlist file** -- a JSON or YAML file (adopter-configured by
  path) declaring the adopter's own noun/adjective vocabulary and, if
  wanted, an explicit list of *permitted* adjective-noun pairings (to avoid
  combinations the adopter doesn't want). This is intentionally **purely
  declarative data, never executable code** -- earlier design drafts of
  this feature used an adopter-configured shell hook instead, which turned
  out to require extensive subprocess-safety hardening (process-tree
  cleanup, timeout bounding, output-size bounding, encoding handling) for a
  problem that is really just "read some words from a file." A static data
  file has none of that surface: no timeout, no process to kill, no
  encoding-from-a-subprocess concerns, no zombie/leak risk.
