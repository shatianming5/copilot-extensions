"""General pre-render launch-checkpoint tracing.

Relocated out of the bundled Picker's ``picker_tui/frame_health.py``
(2026-09-16, worktree-manager-control-plane Phase 3/6 Step 1.5):
``append_launch_event`` is called from ``cmd_resolve``/``_run_new_picker`` in
``__main__.py`` to record launch checkpoints (``resolve_handler_start``,
``housekeeping_start``, etc.) independent of whether the Textual Picker TUI
itself ends up running, so it survived Step 2's deletion of the rest of the
bundled Picker (including its own render-loop frame-gap diagnostics,
``FrameHealthReporter``, which had no callers left once ``engine.py`` was
deleted and was removed rather than kept as dead code).
