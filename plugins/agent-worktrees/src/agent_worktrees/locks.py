"""Provable-liveness lock files -- the shared primitive of the session-state
lattice (#4272).

The worktree picker wants to read every session-state layer's liveness as a
cheap **filesystem** check instead of a subprocess or socket poke: the Copilot
session lock (`inuse.<pid>.lock`, already authoritative), a per-worktree
**mux-lock** (`mux.<id>.lock`), and a per-session **bridge-lock**
(`bridge.<session>.lock`). This module is the common mechanism all three build
on -- a small JSON lock file whose liveness is *provable* so a crash (no clean
teardown) leaves a **detectably stale** lock rather than a false "alive".

Liveness proof: **PID + process start-time**. Presence of the file is not
liveness -- a reader confirms the recorded pid is still alive AND its process
start-time still matches the recorded one, which defeats PID reuse (a new,
unrelated process that happens to inherit the dead owner's pid has a different
start-time, so the lock reads stale). This needs no long-lived handle held open
by the owner, so it works for third-party owners (the mux server) as well as our
own processes -- the durable, broadly-applicable choice over an advisory
``flock`` a live owner must keep held.

Leaf module: no intra-package imports, so every layer (sessions, reclaim,
picker, doctor) can depend on it without a cycle. Everything is best-effort and
never raises on I/O or process-query failure; an unreadable/torn lock reads as
absent, and an unprovable owner (alive pid, unreadable start-time) is treated as
live (fail-open -- never hide a session that might be real).
