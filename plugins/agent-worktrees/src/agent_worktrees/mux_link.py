"""Resident manager-observation IPC seam (Phase 3b Slice 2 Sub-slice 3, Step 1
-- ``worktree-manager-control-plane`` effort).

Additive-only groundwork for the two-daemon mux-status split: the resident
``agent-worktrees`` status-monitor gains a dedicated wire surface that lets an
external Worktree Manager mux-companion daemon **push** live mux-mapping
observations for the sessions *it* owns, plus an in-process cache that stores
them. Nothing in this module changes who writes a session's status bar or
which sessions get served -- ``status_monitor_cli.cmd_status_monitor`` only
starts this endpoint and merges its (currently always-empty, since no
Worktree Manager daemon exists yet to push into it) observations into the
resident monitor's existing catalog-observation call, per this step's own
scope in
``efforts/active/worktree-manager-control-plane/phase-3b-substatus-monitor-relocation.md``.

Mirrors ``classify_daemon.py``/``worktree_status_daemon.py`` structurally: a
``work_coalescing_singleton.CoalescingServer`` wraps a ``compute(kind,
payload)`` callback, rendezvous fields are namespaced so they never collide
with the other daemons already published in the same ``status-monitor.lock``
file, and the client-side ``mux_live_via_daemon``/``mux_live_with_boot``
helpers mirror ``worktree_status_daemon.status_via_daemon``/
``status_with_boot`` exactly -- kept here (not yet called by anything) so the
full wire contract is pinned in one step, ready for the Worktree Manager
mux-companion daemon (a later sub-slice) to call.

# could persist a higher one in between, and the old process's later
# `os.replace` would still regress the file with its own stale merge.

class ManagedMuxCache:
    """Thread-safe store of Manager-reported ``(project, worktree_id)`` ⇄
    mux session/pane mapping observations (the documented ``mux-live-v1``
    payload shape), with a best-effort on-disk snapshot so a mapping
    survives one resident-monitor restart.

    Keyed by ``(project, worktree_id)`` -- ``worktree_id`` alone is not
    guaranteed unique across two different projects (Copilot review
    finding: keying on ``worktree_id`` alone let two projects' same-ID
    worktrees overwrite each other's mapping, or wrongly reject a valid
    lower revision as stale for an unrelated project, and could make
    :meth:`live_session_names` silently lose a live session). Each
    observation carries a ``mapping_revision`` (a non-negative integer the
    *reporting* Manager mux-companion daemon owns and increments, scoped per
    ``(project, worktree_id)``); an incoming observation whose revision is
    lower than the currently stored one for that same key is rejected
    rather than applied, so a stale/out-of-order ``live: false`` (or
    stale-pane) event can never clobber a newer live mapping that already
    arrived out of send order over a connectionless, potentially-concurrent
    transport. Revisions equal to the stored one are accepted (idempotent
    replay -- e.g. a caller retrying after a response it never saw).

    A live entry with no fresh observation for
    :data:`MAPPING_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` is treated as stale/unconfirmed by
    :meth:`live_session_names`/:meth:`has_any_live` (excluded from both)
    without being deleted -- :meth:`get`/:meth:`snapshot` still return it
    (with its true ``live`` bit) for callers that want the raw record.

    When ``persist_path`` is given, every successful :meth:`apply_observation`
    merges this process's in-memory entries with whatever is currently on
    disk (keeping the higher ``mapping_revision`` per key) and writes the
    merged result -- a JSON **array** of already-self-describing entries
    (never a JSON object keyed by a separately-trusted string, which is
    exactly the shape that let an earlier revision of this cache accept an
    entry under a JSON key that disagreed with its own ``worktree_id``
    field) -- to that path (atomic replace, best-effort: a write failure is
    swallowed rather than raised, matching the resident monitor's own
    tolerance for a non-fatal persistence hiccup). The merge (rather than a
    blind overwrite) narrows the window where two monitor processes briefly
    overlap during a handoff, each with their own in-memory cache sharing
    this path (Copilot review finding) -- see :meth:`_persist_locked`'s own
    docstring for the full rationale. The constructor warm-loads any
    existing snapshot the same way, re-deriving each entry's storage key
    from its own validated ``project``/``worktree_id`` fields. This lets the
    Step 1 seam's own contract-level requirement -- a mapping survives one
    daemon restart -- hold even though ``InProcessRuntime`` itself is
    otherwise stateless across restarts, matching
    ``worktree_status_daemon.WorktreeStatusCache``'s own durable-across-
    restart precedent.

    :meth:`close` marks this cache permanently closed: every subsequent
    :meth:`apply_observation` call becomes a safe no-op instead of writing.
    ``CoalescingServer.close()`` stops *accepting* new work but does not
    wait for an already-dispatched request-handler thread to finish (see
    its own docstring) -- without this guard, such a late handler could
    still call into a cache whose owning ``InProcessRuntime`` has already
    been shut down and atomically persist an *older* snapshot after a
    replacement runtime has already persisted a newer revision to the same
    ``persist_path``, regressing the on-disk monotonicity guard across a
    restart (Copilot review finding). ``InProcessRuntime.shutdown()`` calls
    this after closing the server, serialized through the same lock every
    ``apply_observation`` call takes, so a handler already past this check
    when ``close()`` runs still completes normally, but any handler that
    reaches the lock afterward safely aborts instead of writing.
