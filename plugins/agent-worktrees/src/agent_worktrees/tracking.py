    framework explicitly excludes tracking YAML, so no such mechanism has
    an actual entry point to invoke it).

    For each ``current.prs`` (on-disk) entry:

    1. Backfill a fresh ``pr_id`` if it doesn't have one yet.

       the value already durably on disk wins that tie. Only a STRICTLY
       LOWER ``current`` revision leaves the in-memory entry unchanged. If

    follow-up, #957/#220). An unpaired record becomes a minimal
    ``archived`` tombstone (``reaped_at`` stamped), not a deletion --
    identity, lineage, and session history stay queryable after the
    checkout is gone. A **paired** record's fate depends on whether its
    sibling is ITSELF already reaped:

    * If the sibling record is missing, not yet ``finalized``, or ``finalized``
      but not marked :attr:`WorktreeRecord.reaped_at` (i.e. still a live,
      merge-safe-but-not-yet-cleaned worktree), this record is instead
      rewritten as a minimal ``finalized`` tombstone (with ``reaped_at``
      stamped) rather than unlinked. :func:`find_paired_record` resolves a
      sibling purely by whether ``<id>.yaml`` exists in the *other* project's
      tracking directory, so deleting it outright would leave the sibling
      side with no way to distinguish "this half of the pair was never
      carved" from "this half was already reaped" --
      :func:`default_paired_sibling_final` reports ``None`` ("unknown")
      either way, and a `None` permanently spares the sibling's own
      paired-worktree gate. A tombstoned ``finalized`` record lets that probe
      resolve ``sibling.status == "finalized"`` -> ``True`` and unblock the
      sibling's cleanup, without weakening the gate for a pair that
      genuinely hasn't been carved yet.
    * If the sibling record exists AND already carries ``reaped_at`` (proof
      it is itself a tombstone left by this exact function, not a live
      worktree that merely reads ``finalized``), nothing depends on
      resolving *this* record any more: the sibling's own reap has already
      happened and only ever needed to be observed once, by this reap. Both
      records are deleted outright rather than leaving two dangling
      tombstones behind forever.

      ``reaped_at`` -- rather than ``status`` -- is the signal this decision
      keys on precisely because ``status == "finalized"`` alone is
      ambiguous: a live, not-yet-cleaned worktree can legitimately carry it
      for a long time before ``cleanup`` ever removes its directory (merge
      -safe and already-reaped are different things -- see ``finalize``'s
      own contract). Peeking at status alone to decide on a hard delete
      would delete live tracking metadata for a worktree still on disk.
      ``reaped_at`` is set in exactly one place (this function's tombstone
      branch), so its presence is unambiguous, positive proof of an actual
      reap.

    Any resolution failure (an unreadable sibling record, a cross-machine
    pair, etc.) is treated as "not confirmed reaped" and falls back to the
    tombstone path -- matching :func:`default_paired_sibling_final`'s own
    "unknown -> spare" philosophy.

    Fail-safe: if a tombstone write raises for any reason, falls back to a
    plain unlink -- a reap must never be blocked *indefinitely* by this
    bookkeeping.

    **Locking (pr-attribution-codenames Phase 2 follow-up).** Every delete
    (including the sibling delete, in the both-reaped hard-delete branch) is
    taken under a REAL cross-process ``_RecordLock`` (``require_sidecar=True``)
    -- not just the tombstone rewrite, which already went through
    ``save_record``'s own locking. Two properties this closes:

    * Without any lock, a concurrent reader/backfiller (e.g.
      ``codename_tracking.ensure_codename``, which holds the SAME record's
      lock across its own existence-check + save) could observe the record
      present an instant before this function unlinks it, or recreate one
      this function just deleted.
    * ``require_sidecar=True`` makes that guarantee REAL cross-process, not
      just same-thread. A contended lock (this record's, or -- both-reaped
      branch -- the sibling's) makes this call **defer**: return ``False``
      without deleting anything, rather than blocking indefinitely or
      proceeding without real exclusivity. The caller's reap runs on a
      cadence (`cleanup`/`gc`), so a deferred record retries later.
    * The two locks in the both-reaped hard-delete branch are acquired in a
      **deterministic order** (sorted by path) via one ``ExitStack``,
      all-or-nothing -- never unconditionally, which would let two
      concurrent calls on the two halves of the SAME pair deadlock each
      other.
    * The sibling's expected path is locked whenever this record is paired
      with a resolvable ref -- **not only** once this call has already
      decided the sibling looks reaped. The hard-delete-vs-tombstone
      decision itself is made only AFTER both locks are held (a pre-lock
      read is racy against a concurrent call on the other half of the SAME
      pair reaching its own hard-delete first). Once locked, this call also
      re-checks its OWN file first: if a concurrent call already hard-deleted
      it (the both-reaped branch removes both files), there is nothing left
      to do -- falling through to the tombstone branch would wrongly
      RECREATE a file a legitimate concurrent hard-delete had already
      removed (copilot-extensions#3749).

    Returns ``True`` once the record is durably retired (tombstoned or
    deleted, or found already retired by a concurrent call); ``False`` if
    deferred by a contended lock -- callers treat that as "retry on a later
    reap pass," not a failure.

    Orthogonal to git/session state -- this records what only the agent knows:
    whether the worktree is genuinely *resolved* or still has *actionable
    follow-ups*, plus a one-line summary of what it is/left at and (optionally) a
    fresh ``title`` when the worktree's focus changes. ``summary``, ``title``,
    ``activity`` and ``follow_up`` are each applied only when not None, so a
    caller may update one without disturbing the others. An asserted ``title``
    is capped at :data:`TITLE_MAX` (:func:`cap_title`) so it fits the status
    bar / Picker rows.

    The three text fields have deliberately DIFFERENT update cadences (see
    ``status_cli``'s own per-flag help text for the guidance surfaced to a
    calling agent):

    - ``activity`` -- the CURRENT sub-task. Update this most often, every time
      the immediate focus shifts within the same overall piece of work.
    - ``summary`` -- a broader recap. Update occasionally, to fold newly
      completed work into the existing summary -- not on every sub-task.
    - ``title`` -- the rare, intentional headline. Update only when the
      worktree's main theme genuinely changes.

    Stamps ``status_note_at`` (which the postToolUse nudge watches to reset its
    drift counter) on ANY of the three changing, plus its own ``activity_at``
    when ``activity`` specifically changes (a separate freshness signal the
    Picker can grade independently, mirroring the live-pulse intent's own
    fresh/stale distinction). Appends a durable entry to the worktree's
    disposition-history sidecar (see :mod:`agent_worktrees.disposition_history`).
    ``tracking_path`` scopes that sidecar write to an explicit project, not the
    ambient ``cfg.tracking_dir()`` -- for a caller (e.g. a daemon) serving several projects.

class _RecordLock:
    """Short-lived lock for a read-modify-write on a tracking YAML.

    Acquires an **in-process** re-entrant per-path lock (``_path_write_lock``) so
    concurrent read-modify-writes in the SAME process -- the picker's background
    stamp threads and a foreground resume -- are serialized on every platform.
    It ALSO takes a real **cross-process** advisory lock on a ``.lock`` sidecar so
    that two *separate* processes (e.g. two Picker reconcilers, or a Picker and a
    foreground CLI) can't interleave their read -> modify -> write and clobber one
    another's update:

    - **POSIX** -- ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)`` on the sidecar fd.
    - **Windows** -- ``msvcrt.locking(LK_NBLCK)`` on the sidecar fd. Windows has
      no ``fcntl``; before dotfiles#1860 the Windows path held ONLY the
      in-process RLock, which is a no-op across processes, so concurrent Picker
      reconcilers' RMW cycles clobbered each other (last-writer-wins silently
      dropping the other's update). The ``msvcrt`` byte-range lock closes that
      gap so cross-process exclusion holds on Windows too.

    **Criticality-aware acquisition (#4547).** The caller picks how it competes:

    - ``blocking=True`` (default) -- a **critical writer** (finalize, a lifecycle
      transition, a handoff). It waits up to ``timeout`` for the sidecar, then
      **proceeds anyway** on the in-process lock alone (graceful degradation; the
      atomic temp+replace retry in ``_atomic_write`` is the last line of defence)
      -- so a critical update is never dropped. ``acquired`` is always True.
      Callers that cannot safely degrade may set ``require_sidecar=True`` to
      raise :class:`TimeoutError` instead.
    - ``blocking=False`` -- a **best-effort background writer** (a Picker sweep's
      liveness/session-state stamp). It makes a **single** non-blocking attempt at
      both the in-process and the sidecar lock; if either is already held it
      **skips** -- ``acquired`` is False and the caller must no-op its write this
      pass (these writers are idempotent and self-heal next sweep). This is the
      guarantee that an inconsequential sweep never blocks, nor is blocked by, a
      critical updater.

    Always check ``acquired`` inside a ``blocking=False`` ``with`` block before
    writing; for the default ``blocking=True`` it is always True.

    **Scope -- keep the lock window to the RMW only (#4547).** Wrap exactly the
    ``load_record -> mutate -> save_record`` window and **never hold the lock
    across network or git I/O** (a fetch, push, rebase, or provider call). Two
    consequences follow:

    - **Foreground CLI verbs** whose RMW is self-contained (``set-pr``,
      ``set-disposition``, ``mark-complete``, resume's ``mark_resumed``, the
      resource-claim verbs, ``set-pr --title-only``) load *inside* a blocking
      lock and save before releasing -- so a best-effort sweep skips while they
      hold it, completing the cooperative protocol.
    - **Long I/O-spanning flows** (``create_pr`` / ``_push_changes_pr`` writes
      that follow a rebase+push, ``finalize``'s terminal status write) load the
      record once and thread it across heavy I/O by design, so they *cannot* be
      one short locked RMW. Their write-atomicity is guaranteed by
      ``_atomic_write`` and their staleness is self-healed by the reconcile
      guards; they deliberately stay outside the fine lock rather than hold it
      across I/O. A pre-I/O sub-write (e.g. ``push_changes`` setting the title
      before the push) is reload-merged under a tight lock instead.
