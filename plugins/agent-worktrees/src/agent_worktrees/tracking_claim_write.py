"""``claim_add``/``claim_release``/``claim_settle`` verbs.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 3 -- the third
migrated call-site cluster: the outbound resource-claim ledger's three
single-worktree write transactions (``claims add``/``release``/``settle``,
previously inline in ``claims_cli.py``). A "closely related cluster"
landed together, per the effort README's own Phase 3 guidance, mirroring
``tracking_followup_write.py``'s own shape exactly.

**Deliberately excludes** ``claims sweep``/``claims reconcile-at-rest``
(multi-worktree batch operations iterating every local ledger under one
sweep, not a single-worktree transaction) and the cross-machine
``owner_ref`` resolution/deferral path (a CLI-level concern resolved
BEFORE a local ``yaml_path`` is even known -- there is nothing to migrate
when the answer is "deferred to the lease mirror, no local write"). Both
stay call-site-level, migrated (if ever) in a later, narrower slice.

**No cross-project trace-scoping concern here either** (unlike
``status_disposition_write``'s ``status_reported`` event): none of
``claim_added``/``claim_released``/``claim_settled`` are stage-mapped in
``activity.HANDOFF_STAGE_MAP``, so ``activity.log_event`` never reaches
``handoff_trace.append_event`` for any of them.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 3's fifth cluster
(this same PR) reuses ``apply_claim_settle`` for ``handoff_cutover.py``'s
``_settle_predecessor_session_claim`` repair via the ``skip_if_released``
guard above, rather than registering a new verb for it -- both wrap the
identical ``tracking.settle_resource_claim`` transaction, only differing
in whether an already-``released`` claim is a silent no-op (repair) or
resettled to the requested disposition (the public CLI command, which
also supports settling explicitly TO ``released``).

    ``skip_if_released`` (default ``False``, preserving the public ``claims
    settle`` CLI command's existing behavior unchanged) is an opt-in guard
    for a best-effort repair caller (``handoff_cutover.py``'s
    ``_settle_predecessor_session_claim``): when set and the matched claim
    is already ``released``, this returns a silent ``{"ok": True, "skipped":
    "released"}`` no-op instead of settling it, so a ``deregister_session``
    that raced ahead and released the claim first is never resurrected back
    to another disposition (mirrors ``finalize.py``'s
    ``_settle_current_session_claim`` guard). Checked BEFORE the
    reservation check below (2026-09-27 PR review finding) so a released
    claim that still carries a stale reservation still silently no-ops --
    the old inline repair never reached a reservation check once a claim
    was already released, and reordering this after it would surface a
    spurious ``{"error": "reserved"}`` instead. Must run inside this same
    locked transaction, not at the caller -- checking then dispatching as
    two separate steps would reopen exactly the race this guards against.

    Always hard-requires the sidecar (2026-09-27 PR review findings): the
    pre-migration inline repair's own OUTER ``_RecordLock`` degraded on
    contention, but its final ``tracking.save_record`` call already
    hard-required the sidecar internally (``save_record`` never accepted a
    softer policy) -- so on real contention the old code's net effect was
    ALWAYS to fail the write and let it fall through to this repair's own
    best-effort ``contextlib.suppress(Exception)``, never to persist a
    stale in-memory snapshot without cross-process exclusion. Matching
    that net effect here (rather than genuinely degrading) avoids silently
    resurrecting an already-``released`` claim if a concurrent
    ``deregister_session`` released it between this verb's own load and
    save.
