    """Read-only fleet-wide inventory: surfaces the four obligation
    categories the effort's own Plan names as needing a preview, in one
    report, so an operator (or a periodic audit) does not have to remember
    to check each one separately:

    - **legacy boolean follow-ups**: ``follow_up: true`` with no itemized
      ``follow_ups`` entries (pre-Phase-3 records) -- informational only; no
      automated apply exists (materializing one requires a human-written
      summary, a judgment call this command deliberately does not guess at).
    - **active effort bindings**: ``rec.active_effort`` set -- informational;
      an operator decides whether the binding is stale.
    - **at-rest claims**: any held claim in ``at-rest`` state -- the ONE
      category with an existing apply path, ``claims reconcile-at-rest``;
      this report points at it rather than duplicating its logic.
    - **stale-finalized**: ``status == "finalized"`` records whose
      (freshly, locally re-classified -- no network fetch) `cleanup_disposition`
      is no longer cleanable -- e.g. new commits landed on the branch, or a
      held claim/follow-up was added, since the record was finalized. Keyed
      off `cleanup_disposition` rather than the closure descriptor's
      `final` flag deliberately: `final` requires fresh (fetched) evidence
      to ever report `True`, which a no-fetch audit could never satisfy for
      ANY record -- `cleanup_disposition` has no such freshness gate and is
      the practical "has this record's invariant drifted" signal instead.

    Read-only: never mutates a record. ``--apply`` is intentionally NOT
    accepted here (unlike ``reconcile-at-rest``/``sweep``/``cleanup``) --
    each category either has its own dedicated apply command already, or
    requires a judgment call this report does not make for the operator.
