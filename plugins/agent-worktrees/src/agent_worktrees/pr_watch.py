"""``pr-watch`` -- block until a pull request moves, then wake the caller.

The provider-generic port of the multi-machine system ``tools/pr-watch`` script into the
plugin.  It owns the **network + timing** half of the watcher (poll, retry,
timeout, baseline); the **pure transition logic** lives in
:mod:`agent_worktrees.pr_contract` (``compute_events`` / ``Baseline``), and the
**provider read** (``get_snapshot``) lives in the provider plugins.  The review
backend -- host, token, and (later) verdict vocabulary -- is a multi-machine system
**binding** supplied by ``PRConfig``; nothing here hardcodes Gitea.

An agent that just opened a PR fires ``pr-watch wait`` as a background task; the
task polls the provider and blocks until a target transition (a review by
someone other than the author, a mergeability flip, or the PR merging/closing),
then prints the event JSON and exits 0.  The Copilot CLI surfaces the
background-task completion as a new turn, waking the otherwise-idle session so it
can address feedback, re-push, or finalize -- unattended.

Exit codes mirror the multi-machine system tool: 0 = a transition fired, 124 = timed out,
3 = provider/auth error, 2 = usage error.

    The base keys are field-for-field identical to the multi-machine system
    ``tools/pr-watch`` payload so a thin shim delegating here is a drop-in (same
    keys, same JSON shape). Additively, a **``merge``** block
    (:func:`pr_contract.merge_readiness`) reports what stands between the PR and
    a merge -- crucially ``needs_consent`` / ``consent_action`` -- so a caller
    woken by an ``approved`` transition learns it must still *grant merge
    consent* (add the auto-merge label) rather than assuming the PR will merge on
    its own. The consent vocabulary is a multi-machine system binding passed in by the CLI
    (``automerge_label`` etc.); with none configured the block degrades to a
    verdict/merge-state readout with no action. ``review_blocking`` (default
    ``True``) forwards to :func:`pr_contract.merge_readiness` -- ``False``
    reports a bare comment as the ``"COMMENTED"`` verdict for a repo whose
    reviewer cannot render a binding one.

    A ``pr-self-merge`` repo's raw ``eligible``/``reason`` pair here reflects
    only the human-approval gate, which can read as a hard block even when
    the acting identity actually holds a live Maintainer-bypass right on that
    gate (ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3638). This function has no
    provider/token access to resolve that bypass note itself -- the caller
    (``pr_cli.py``'s ``wait`` dispatch) resolves it with a single live read
    *after* :func:`run_wait` returns (never before a potentially long/
    unbounded wait, which could report since-revoked authorization as
    current fact) and merges it into the returned payload directly.
