"""The machine-local project root as an ``.agent-*`` config overlay source.

A stateless harness keeps machine-specific entries out of its tree: its setup
writes them under the machine-local project root (``agent-worktrees get
config-dir``, e.g. ``~/.<project>/.agent-worktrees/related.yaml``). That root
joins :func:`state_root.config_source_anchors` between the launch repo and the
knowledge overlay, so a session in any checkout of the project resolves them.
