"""Per-worktree codename assignment, backfill, and lookup (effort:
``pr-attribution-codenames`` Phase 2, issue #2838).

Phase 1 (:mod:`agent_worktrees.codename`) built the neutral generator and the
declarative wordlist loader; this module wires that generator to the actual
local tracking store: assigning one codename per worktree at ``create`` time,
lazily backfilling a pre-existing record that predates this feature, and
resolving a codename back to its worktree id for ``list``/``resolve``.

Kept as its own module rather than growing ``tracking.py`` or ``__main__.py``
further -- both are at or near their ``tools/check-module-size.py`` ceiling
