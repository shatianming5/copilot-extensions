"""Durable per-worktree DISPOSITION HISTORY -- the trajectory of a worktree's
agent-asserted summary / title / follow-up over time.

The tracking record (``<id>.yaml``) keeps only the *latest* disposition ("latest
wins"), so it answers "where does this worktree stand *now*" but not "what has
this worktree *been doing*". This module appends one durable JSONL entry per
disposition write to a sidecar alongside the record --
``~/.<project>/worktrees/<id>.history.jsonl`` -- so an agent picking up a
worktree can read the tail and immediately grok its arc (focus shifts, what got
done, when follow-ups opened/closed) without spelunking session transcripts.

Contract:

- **Append-only, one JSON object per line.** Each entry is a self-contained
  snapshot of the disposition AFTER the write, plus which fields the write
  touched::

      {"at": "<iso>", "changed": ["summary","title"], "title": "<str|null>",
       "summary": "<str>", "follow_up": <bool>}

  ``at`` mirrors the record's ``status_note_at`` stamp, so history lines
  correlate 1:1 with the record's disposition timeline.
- **Durable, not time-pruned.** Unlike the machine-wide session ``activity.jsonl``
  (7-day window), this is the worktree's own memory -- it lives and dies with the
  tracking record. It is bounded only by a generous entry **cap** (trim-oldest)
  so a pathological writer can't grow it without limit.
- **Best-effort + fail-open.** History is an aid, never load-bearing: every
  operation swallows its own errors so a history hiccup never breaks a
  disposition write, a status read, or a record removal.

Cleanup: :func:`remove` is called wherever a tracking ``<id>.yaml`` is unlinked
(full worktree removal / prune), so the sidecar never outlives its record.

    the snapshot carries the resulting values so each line is self-contained.
    ``activity`` is the agent-asserted CURRENT sub-task (distinct from
    ``summary``'s broader recap and ``title``'s rare headline -- see
    ``tracking.set_disposition``'s own docstring for the cadence contract);
    omitted from the line when empty, same as every other neutral-default
    field below. ``paused`` is a purely informational "intentionally idle
    for now" overlay (never fed to any gate, unlike ``follow_up``); omitted
    from the line when ``False``.

    ``kind`` classifies the entry -- ``"status"`` (a disposition write; the
    default so every existing caller is unchanged), ``"bind"`` (a session
    declared ownership), or ``"handoff"`` (a terse handoff reference). ``kind``
    is what lets the worktree remember *what kind of thing* each session did, not
    just its latest disposition.

    ``session_id`` tags the entry with the session that wrote it, so the history
    is session-attributed ("each session contributes its own marked entries").
    Both are omitted from the line when at their neutral default (``status`` /
    ``None``) so legacy readers and byte-comparisons of status-only histories are
    unaffected.

    ``tracking_path`` is forwarded to :func:`history_path` unchanged -- see that
    function's own docstring for why an explicit path is safer than the ambient
    ``cfg.tracking_dir()`` default for a cross-project-capable caller.
