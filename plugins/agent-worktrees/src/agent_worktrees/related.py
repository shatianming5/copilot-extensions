"""Per-project "related repos" -- the directional relationship layer.

Where ``repos.yaml`` (see :mod:`agent_worktrees.repos`) is a **global,
machine-wide catalog** of every checkout, this module models the
**directional, per-project** view: *from the current repo's point of view*,
which other repos are relevant, why, and -- crucially -- **where to actually
work on them**.

The data lives **in-repo and committed**, at
``<anchor>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related.yaml`` (alongside the
in-repo ``config.yaml``), with a plain-markdown narrative per related repo
under ``<anchor>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related/<name>.md``.
Legacy ``.agent-worktrees/related.yaml`` remains readable for compatibility.
Because it is committed, it travels with the repo and is shared across
machines and collaborators.

Design intent (so we never duplicate the registry):

* ``related.yaml`` keys are **names in the global registry**.  A related entry
  adds only **relationship** (``role`` / ``summary`` / ``doc``), **locus**
  (where work happens: ``local`` / ``machine:<key>`` / ``codespace``, plus
  per-machine availability), and **delegate** (how to hand work to the agent
  that owns the repo).  Checkout paths, class, remote, and ``contributing``
  still resolve from ``repos.yaml`` -- never restated here.
* Per-machine availability and preferred locus are **directional only** -- the
  global registry is intentionally *not* extended with per-machine paths.
* A top-level ``primary:`` marker names the default/primary project repo.

Schema (``<anchor>/.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related.yaml``)::

    primary: example-web
    related:
      example-web:
        role: product
        summary: "Primary product monorepo we ship changes to."
        doc: related/example-web.md
        locus:
          preferred: codespace          # local | machine:<key> | codespace
          codespace: { repo: org/example-web-codespaces,
                       machine: largePremiumLinux256gb, location: EastUs }
        delegate: { via: agent-codespaces }
        plugins:                        # related-repo plugins agent-bridge side-loads
          - { source: example-web-codespace@example-marketplace }
          - { source: some-plugin@example-marketplace, enable: false }
      copilot-extensions:
        role: tooling
        summary: "Source of the plugins this control plane drives."
        doc: related/copilot-extensions.md
        locus: { preferred: machine:dev6, machines: [dev6, cloud1] }
        delegate: { via: agent-bridge }

All reads degrade safely: a missing or malformed file yields an empty
:class:`RelatedConfig` rather than raising, mirroring the config/registry
loaders.

    availability the global, per-*platform* registry cannot express.

    Two **cloud/sandbox venues** carry their own provisioning hints, each a
    free-form mapping:

    * ``codespace`` -- a GitHub CodeSpace (``repo`` / ``machine`` / ``location``
      / ``workspace_folder``).  CodeSpaces run in the cloud, so they are

    * ``container`` -- a local Docker dev-container fleet (``repo`` /
      ``workspace_folder`` plus a ``machines`` list scoping it to the boxes
      that host the fleet).  Unlike a CodeSpace, a container fleet is local, so
      ``machines`` restricts where it can be used (e.g. ``[dev6]``).

    ``workspace_folder`` records the checkout path the venue lands in (e.g.
    ``/workspaces/example-web``), which often differs from the venue ``repo`` name.
