    ``mux_live`` signals against the authoritative machine-wide scans (#4057 /
    #1416 / dotfiles#1205).

    Despite the name (kept for its call sites), this sweep now reconciles BOTH
    liveness hints in one records pass: the bound-Copilot signal (below) and the
    ``mux_live`` signal. ``mux_live`` is otherwise only stamped at discrete
    lifecycle events, so a ``wt-<id>`` mux that appears AFTER its last event-time
    stamp (e.g. a psmux startup-restore landing minutes after resume) would
    persist a stale ``false`` for a genuinely live mux; recomputing it here --
    mirroring bound liveness -- keeps it honest (dotfiles#1205).

    A bare-resumed Copilot (cwd=home) is invisible to BOTH the registered-session
    lock scan (its session was never registered under the worktree) and the mux
    batch (a bare Copilot has no mux), so its worktree wrongly renders non-ACTIVE
    (#1416). This reconciler resolves every live bound Copilot on the machine via
    :func:`reclaim.resolve_bound_copilots` -- cwd-independent, and NOT
    self-excluding (unlike ``bare_orphan_worktree_ids``, so it also counts *this*
    session's own worktree and every mux-homed one) -- and stamps each affected
    worktree's cached ``bound_live`` so a follow-up populate can surface a
    bare-resumed session in the Active section from cache alone.

    TRI-STATE, minimal-churn: a live worktree is stamped ``True`` (refresh, so a
    steadily-live session's hint never ages out); a worktree that was ``True`` but
    is no longer bound is stamped ``False`` (the session-ended transition). A
    never-bound worktree is left untouched (``None`` = Unknown, NEVER persisted),
    so the fleet's idle YAMLs are not rewritten. When the scan itself fails
    (Unknown), nothing is stamped. Never raises; local machine only -- remote
    worktrees reconcile on their owning machine. Returns the count of records
    whose CONSUMER-VISIBLE liveness (fresh ``bound_live=True`` vs not) flipped, so
    a nonzero result reloads the picker -- including a still-live worktree whose
    hint had aged past the populate TTL (renewing it must re-surface it ACTIVE,
    not silently leave it non-active until the next poll).

    A bound Copilot the scan could not attribute to a worktree (``worktree_id``
    None -- a transient attribution failure, not proof of death) suppresses ALL
    negative transitions this pass: a genuinely-gone positive still expires via
    the freshness TTL, but a momentarily-unattributable live session is never
    wrongly cleared to ``False``.
