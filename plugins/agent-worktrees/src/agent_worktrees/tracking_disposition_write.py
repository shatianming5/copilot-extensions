"""``status_disposition_write`` verb -- Phase 3's first migrated call site.

``agent-worktrees-authoritative-daemon`` effort, Phase 3. Wraps
``__main__._cmd_status_write``'s whole guarded transaction (load ->
terminal/effort-bound guards -> conditional reactivation -> ``set_disposition``
-> ``save_record`` -> once-per-session ``status_reported`` activity event, all
under one ``tracking._RecordLock``) as a single :mod:`tracking_write` verb,
per that module's own "verb maps to a whole transaction, not a bare setter"
granularity note.

Picked as the effort's first real call site because it is the "narrower,
lower-traffic disposition-assertion path" the effort README explicitly names
as a safer first pick than ``register_session`` (sessionStart-hook-critical)
or ``mark_resumed`` (embedded in a bigger resume flow) -- an operator-invoked
``status`` write, not a hot facility path.

**Env vars are read by the caller, never by this verb.** The call site reads
``COPILOT_AGENT_SESSION_ID`` from its own process environment and passes it
in as ``session_id`` -- reading it here would read the *daemon's* environment
when this verb runs via the resident daemon, not the CLI invocation's, which
would silently break the once-per-session ``status_reported`` bookkeeping.

**The disposition-history sidecar is explicitly scoped, never ambient.**
``tracking.set_disposition`` is passed ``tracking_path=yaml_path.parent``
(this verb's own resolved record directory) rather than relying on its
default ``cfg.tracking_dir()`` fallback -- the daemon process's own ambient
active project need not match the project the dispatching CLI call actually
targets, and an ambient-scoped write would silently corrupt a *different*
project's disposition-history sidecar (2026-09-26 PR review finding).

**The status_reported durable trace is scoped the same way.** The call site
reads its own ``cfg.project_name()`` (mirroring ``session_id`` above) and
passes it in as ``project``, forwarded to ``activity.log_event``'s explicit
``project`` override -- ``handoff_trace.append_event`` otherwise falls back
to the executing process's own ambient ``cfg.active_project()``, which is
the same cross-project hazard as the sidecar above (2026-09-26 PR review
finding, round 2).
