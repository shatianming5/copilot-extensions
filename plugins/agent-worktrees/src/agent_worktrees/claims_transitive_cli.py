"""``agent-worktrees claims transitive`` -- Plan Phase 3 (discovery
ergonomics) of the ``worktree-claims-transitive-finalization`` tracking
effort: a cheap, read-only query answering "what does my whole subtree still
owe?" without manually walking each child worktree's own ``claims`` output.

Pure diagnostic convenience -- the real finalize-safety guarantee (the
bottom-up per-hop settlement proven end-to-end by
``test_transitive_finalize_integration.py``) does not depend on this query
existing; it only reports the SAME local ``worktree``-kind edges the
existing obligation gate already trusts, in one place instead of requiring
a manual child-by-child ``claims`` read.

    An active ``worktree``-kind claim is itself included in the result (it
    means that child has not finalized yet, which is exactly what still
    blocks the parent's own finalize per the obligation gate) -- descent
    reports what the CHILD additionally owes on top of that, it never

    excluded, mirroring ``finalize._assert_obligations_settled``'s own
    exclusion (advisory-only; a normally-running worktree always carries an
    active one for its own live session).

    Returns ``(obligations, unresolved)``. Each ``obligations`` entry carries
    ``path`` -- the worktree-id chain from the root (inclusive) to the
    record that actually holds the claim -- so a caller never has to
    re-derive "who holds this" by hand. ``unresolved`` entries are subtree
    edges this machine could not actually check: a cross-machine child (the
    same case ``finalize._settle_parent_obligation`` defers to the lease
    mirror / ``claims sweep``), a vanished/unreadable record, or a cyclic
    edge (never expected from normal creation, but the walk must still
    terminate rather than recurse forever if the ledger is ever hand-edited
    into one). Every ``unresolved`` entry always has a sibling ``obligations``
    entry for the same claim (both come from the same active, unsettled
    ``worktree``-kind claim) -- so an empty ``obligations`` list always
    implies an empty ``unresolved`` list too; there is no path to reporting
    "settled" while something is genuinely still unresolved underneath.
