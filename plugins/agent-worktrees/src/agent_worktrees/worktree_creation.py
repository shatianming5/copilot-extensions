"""Worktree-creation core: the paired-knowledge carve and ``_create_worktree_core``.

Componentized out of ``__main__.py``'s launch core (module-size split,
``module-componentization-discipline`` effort). This owns the full "create a
new worktree" side-effect sequence -- codename allocation, owner-claim
journaling, the git worktree/branch/tracking-record write, and the paired
citadel knowledge-repo carve (#957) -- used by ``create``/``run``/``embody``'s
new-worktree path and by the registrar/pool declaration flow.

``__main__.py`` stays the compatibility/composition root: it imports and
re-exports every name defined here (several sibling modules --
``resolve_launch_cli.py``, ``worktree_ops_cli.py`` -- already call
``_create_worktree_core`` via their own ``_core()`` proxy) so every existing
caller and every test's ``monkeypatch.setattr(m, "<name>", ...)`` keep working
unchanged. Every cross-call between the functions below -- and every call out
to a helper that still lives in ``__main__.py`` proper (launch-plan building,
launch preflight, worktree-record serialization) -- goes through ``_core()``
(the live ``__main__`` module object) rather than a bare local name, so a
test's monkeypatch on ``m.<name>`` is observed no matter which function in
this band makes the call, exactly as the handoff-cutover slice's own
``_core()`` idiom already established for this same file.

    Picker, exempt from routine cleanup); ``owner``/``name`` label it for the
    System-menu browse view.

    ``no_pair`` opts THIS creation out of the paired-knowledge carve
    regardless of ``origin`` -- for a registrar/pool declaration that has no
    bound knowledge repo to give every worker (e.g. a portable pool). It is
    a narrower, per-call sibling of the blunt whole-host
    ``AGENT_WORKTREES_NO_PAIR`` env var; either one skips the carve.

    ``pending_seed`` persists an optional first-turn prompt onto the new
    record -- this function never launches Copilot, so it can only be
    stored here; `agent-worktrees embody`/`copilot` deliver and clear it
    on the first attach.

    Raises ``RuntimeError`` on failure.
