"""Resolve a repo's committed in-repo config independent of the anchor's
working tree.

``config.py``'s ``_load_inrepo_config`` used to read
``.agent-worktrees/config.yaml`` straight off the anchor's checked-out files.
The anchor is a read-only mirror by design (agents never edit it in place --
see the ``anchor-write-guard``), but nothing kept its *checked-out branch* in
sync with the repo's real default: an anchor left on a stale or wrong local
branch silently fed a stale or wrong ``default_branch`` (and every other
in-repo setting) into every command that resolves the repo, including where
``create``/``create-pr`` fork worktrees and target PRs from.

:func:`load_inrepo_config_from_committed_ref` reads the config as actually
**committed**, via ``git show`` -- entirely independent of the anchor's
working tree or index.
