"""CLI entry point -- subcommand dispatcher for agent-worktrees.

Usage (via binstub):
    <project>                             # launch interactive picker
    <project> --no-update                 # skip pre-flight auto-update
    <project> --no-mux                    # bypass tmux/psmux multiplexer
    <project> resolve [--dry-run]         # emit JSON launch plan
    <project> get <key>                   # query project paths

Usage (direct):
    agent-worktrees resolve [--dry-run] [--recovery] [--no-mux] [-- args...]
    agent-worktrees resolve --json --worktree-id <id>
    agent-worktrees list [--json] [--tracking-status active|complete|...]
    agent-worktrees create [--json]       # programmatic: make a worktree, no launch
    agent-worktrees embody [--worktree-id <id> | --new] [--seed S]  # spawn mux+Copilot
    agent-worktrees finalize [worktree-id | --worktree-id ID] [--dry-run] [--json]
    agent-worktrees mark-complete [worktree-id] [--title T] [--title-only]
    agent-worktrees status [--json]
    agent-worktrees cleanup [--clean] [--include-unused] [--max-age-days N]
    agent-worktrees validate [--dry-run] [--files F...]
    agent-worktrees install [--force] [--machine NAME]
    agent-worktrees uninstall [--remove-config]
    agent-worktrees update
    agent-worktrees install-status
    agent-worktrees get <key>
    agent-worktrees services list [--json]
    agent-worktrees services status [--json]
    agent-worktrees services check-stale <install_dir> <repo_dir>
    agent-worktrees repos list [--type project|repo] [--json]
    agent-worktrees repos find <name>
    agent-worktrees repos srcroot [--set PATH] [--platform P]
    agent-worktrees config-root [--destination PATH] [--json]
    agent-worktrees knowledge compose-plugins [--json] [--cwd PATH]
    agent-worktrees pre-launch
    agent-worktrees reconcile-plugins [--machine M]

JSON mode (--json):
    stdout is machine-parseable JSON only, stderr is log output only.
    No TTY prompts, no picker, no color.  Stable schema with version field.
    Non-zero exit codes for errors with JSON error envelope on stdout.
    --json implies --no-mux.

When invoked with no subcommand (or unrecognized flags), the default
behaviour is "launch": exec into launch-session.sh with passthrough args.
The ``agent-worktrees`` prefix is stripped for SSH compatibility
(``<project> agent-worktrees cleanup`` still works).

# `-m agent_worktrees` (the binstub's own invocation, and this module's
# normal entry point) executes this file under the name ``"__main__"``, a
# SEPARATE sys.modules entry from its real qualified name
# ``agent_worktrees.__main__``. Late in this file, `pr_cli.py` does
# `from . import __main__ as core` -- an ordinary submodule import that,
# absent this alias, finds no `agent_worktrees.__main__` entry yet and
# re-executes this entire module FROM THE TOP under that qualified name.
# That second execution reaches its own `from . import pr_cli, ...` line
# while the FIRST pr_cli import is still mid-load (frozen at its own
# `from . import __main__ as core` line), so it gets back the same
# partially-initialized `pr_cli` module and crashes attribute-binding a name
# `pr_cli` hasn't defined yet ("partially initialized module ... has no
# attribute"). Aliasing the qualified name to the module already executing
# -- BEFORE any submodule import can trigger the problem -- makes `pr_cli`'s
# import a no-op cache hit instead of a second full execution. Fixes #2650.

    """Let tracking metadata override ambiguous git-state classification.

    A **finalized** (or complete/completed) worktree is done and prune-able:
    ``finalize`` sets that status only after verifying the work is safely on
    ``origin/<default>``, and any subsequent ``create-pr`` flips the status away
    from ``finalized``. So the tracking status is authoritative over the raw
    git-state -- trust it (#1447). Two cases it corrects:

    - **zero-commit finalize** -- the reflog has no ``commit`` entries and
      ``classify_worktree`` returns UNUSED.
    - **squash-merged finalize** -- the worktree branch still carries its
      pre-squash commits, so raw git reads ``N ahead / M behind`` (WIP) even
      though the work landed as a squash on the default branch. That "ahead" is
      the un-reconciled squash artifact, not real work-in-progress.

    A **GONE** worktree (its directory is missing) is never masked -- a missing
    checkout is real regardless of status.

    An **ACTIVE** worktree (a live mux/lock session owns it right now, per
    ``active_paths``) is never masked either: a finalized worktree the operator
    has re-opened (or a bare/bound Copilot still holding its lock) is genuinely
    live, and hiding it behind COMPLETED strands the row with no lifecycle verb
    (the bb68/ca29 status-tracking bug -- a muxed/lock-held session rendered
    FINAL). Liveness wins over the durable finalize status.

    A worktree with **any uncommitted content** is never masked either --
    checked two ways so neither a missing count nor a stale state label can
    slip through:

    - ``info.state == DIRTY`` (the direct classifier's own read), kept as an
      explicit fallback because some callers reconstruct a
      ``WorktreeStateInfo`` from a **cached** ``git_state`` string (e.g.
      ``_classify_from_cache``) without repopulating ``dirty`` -- that path
      can hand this function ``state == DIRTY, dirty == 0``, and checking
      only the count would miss it.
    - ``info.dirty > 0`` (the count directly), needed because
      ``_classify_git_state`` can also return ``ORPHAN`` (no merge base)
      while still reporting a nonzero ``dirty`` count -- state-matching
      alone would miss *that* case.

    Uncommitted working-tree changes made *after* finalization are new, real,
    unlanded content that the stale ``finalized``/``complete``/``completed``
    tracking status knows nothing about -- unlike the two corrected cases
    above, this isn't a classifier misreading already-landed work, it's
    genuinely unlanded work. Masking it to COMPLETED would let plain
    ``cleanup --clean`` delete it with no ``--force`` at all.

    worktree whose session held conversation turns), applied here via
    :func:`git_ops.refine_state_with_session` when a ``session_ctx`` is given.
    Classification runs **where git access exists** -- so a remote machine
    carries its own worktree states in ``list --json`` over SSH (the local
    picker cannot git-classify a remote worktree). No fetch (``behind`` reflects
    the last fetch); ~5 git calls per existing worktree, hence opt-in.

    Resident-daemon fast path (Phase 4d, #2323): when ``daemon_filters`` names
    the exact ``status_filter``/``platform_filter``/``all`` values the caller
    used to resolve ``records`` (only ``list --json --classify`` opts in), this
    first tries the resident status-monitor's classify daemon (see
    :mod:`classify_daemon`) via the full boot-wait sequence
    (:func:`classify_daemon.classify_with_boot`) -- booting one via
    :func:`_ensure_status_monitor` when none is currently publishing a
    classify endpoint, waiting up to ``classify_daemon.BOOT_WAIT_S`` -- so
    concurrent classify passes for the same project + filter set coalesce
    onto one resident execution instead of each independently racing the
    lease below. ``daemon_filters=None`` (every other caller) skips the
    daemon entirely -- unchanged behavior. Any miss (no resident monitor,
    boot-wait timeout, unreachable, past its deadline, an error resolving the
    project, or -- critically -- a successful-but-malformed/incomplete
    response whose worktree-id set doesn't match ``records`` exactly) falls
    through to the lease-guarded path exactly as if no daemon existed; a
    partial or garbled daemon answer is never trusted over rendering nothing
    for an affected row.

    Guarded by a per-project :class:`single_instance_lease.SingleInstance`
    (plugin-process-hygiene Phase 4c, #2315): this is the shared entry point
    behind BOTH the Picker's in-process classify pass and a standalone
    ``list --json --classify`` invocation, so two independently-launched
    callers for the same project can otherwise race this same batch of ~5
    git-calls-per-worktree concurrently -- observed live as a Worktree Manager
    display flicker (a row's ``state`` transiently absent mid-race renders a
    generic, potentially wrong heuristic instead of its last-known-correct
    value). A caller that loses the race waits (bounded) for the winner to
    finish, then re-reads its repaired session-render cache -- see
    :func:`_classify_records_wait_then_cache` -- rather than computing its own
    competing pass or rendering a worse answer than before. The lease is
    advisory only: any lease-layer failure (not contention) degrades to
    classifying live, exactly as before this guard existed.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Orphaned launcher-shell reaper (copilot-extensions #102)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# After a worktree session ends cleanly its launcher shells (the pwsh running
# launch-session.ps1 and the `python -m agent_worktrees` waiter) exit with it.
# But a *force-closed* terminal (window closed with the X, a dropped SSH pipe)
# can strand them: the console dies, the shells are re-parented away from a now-
# dead pid, nothing runs under them -- yet they pin memory indefinitely. This
# sweep reclaims those, closing the same intent as the mux reaper
# (visions/agent-fabric §Features/reclaim-idle-process).
#
# SAFETY -- this KILLS processes, so it is engineered to fail SAFE. A live
# telemetry sampler was once wrongly killed because a non-elevated query made a
# hidden scheduled-task service (blank command line, exited parent) look exactly
# like an orphan. The lesson is baked in as independent layers, EVERY one of
# which must pass before a pid is even a candidate:
#   1. POSITIVE signature only. A pid is a candidate ONLY if its command line
#      positively matches an agent-worktrees launcher marker. A service with a
#      blank/absent command line can NEVER match -- we never reap "things that
#      merely look orphaned".
#   2. Service/daemon veto. A session-0 (service) pid, or one whose command line
#      bears a daemon/service/ACP marker, is skipped even if it matched (1).
#   3. Liveness gate. A shell with a live descendant (copilot/node, or a mux
#      client) is a LIVE session and is always spared.
#   4. Self-preservation. The reaper never touches its own process tree.
#   5. Orphan + idle gates. Only a shell whose parent has exited AND that has
#      been alive past the grace window is eligible.
#   6. Dry-run by DEFAULT. Unlike the mux reaper, nothing is killed unless the
#      caller explicitly passes --yes; the default is a report.

    filtered snapshot (launcher shells plus live-descendant witnesses), so
    membership in it cannot answer "is this pid alive?": a launcher started from
    ``cmd.exe``/``bash``/Windows Terminal has a parent that was never enumerated
    and so looks parentless, i.e. an orphan. Callers with a real process table
    pass a probe (``locks.pid_alive``); when it is ``None`` the check degrades to
    the snapshot-membership test, which keeps this function pure for tests.

# module owns BOTH its argparse subparser (via that module's `add_parsers`,
# or `register_cli` for pane_lifecycle) AND its COMMAND_MAP handler, with no
# naming conflict against any other module. Regenerate by importing
# agent_worktrees.__main__ once (pays the full cost, offline), then for each
# add_parsers-owning module, building a throwaway
# `argparse.ArgumentParser().add_subparsers()` and calling that module's own
# `add_parsers(sub)` to see which command names land in `sub.choices`;
# cross-check module/attr via `COMMAND_MAP[name].__module__`/`__name__`.
# Deliberately excludes: commands with no module-owned parser (parser built
# inline in build_parser() -- activity, activity-log, stage-update,
# reconcile-marketplaces, execution-leg, copilot), commands whose handler is
# native to __main__ itself (resolve, handoff-trace), and commands that never
# reach COMMAND_MAP at all (their own hand-rolled manual-dispatch branches in
# main() -- services, repos, accounts, related, state-root,
# coordination-readiness, config-root, knowledge, git, pr*, worktree, lease,
# fleet, reconcile, delegates, hook -- each of those is fixed to do its own
# lazy `from . import <module>` at its own call site instead).
