"""CLI entry point -- subcommand dispatcher for agent-worktrees.

Usage (via binstub):

JSON mode (--json):
    stdout is machine-parseable JSON only, stderr is log output only.
    No TTY prompts, no picker, no color.  Stable schema with version field.
    Non-zero exit codes for errors with JSON error envelope on stdout.
    --json implies --no-mux.

When invoked with no subcommand (or unrecognized flags), the default
behaviour is "launch": exec into launch-session.sh with passthrough args.
The ``agent-worktrees`` prefix is stripped for SSH compatibility
(``<project> agent-worktrees cleanup`` still works).

      command (the same ``_build_launch_cmd`` the picker uses) for a **plain
      interactive** Copilot, open + select a NEW window in the worktree's
      ``wt-<id>`` mux session (cutting the operator over). The seed is encoded as
      a space-free pane-wrapper control argument; the wrapper decodes it after
      psmux's lossy argv reconstruction, appends native
      ``-i <seed>``, and writes a receipt before the parent reports

      window seeded by the prompt, not the old transcript replayed. Returns the
      OLD (pre-cutover) pane id so the successor-side handoff consumer can retire
      it after pickup.
    * **retire** (``--retire-pane <id>``): double-Ctrl-C that specific pane
      (Copilot's native clean quit), hard-killing it only if it will not exit.
      Then, when the predecessor ``--session-id`` is known, **verify its Copilot
      process is gone** -- reaping an orphan by its ``inuse.<pid>.lock`` pid (the
      successor is a different pid, untouched) -- so a hard-killed pane never
      leaves a lingering parallel session that the mux later restores as a
      reappearing pane. Success requires **both** the pane retired and the old
      Copilot process gone.

    and becomes viewable/messageable -- the CLI-first embodiment of
    ``visions/agent-fabric`` §lifetime-decides-embodiment, driven by an agent

    Target selection:
      * ``--worktree-id <id>`` embodies in an existing worktree;
      * ``--new`` creates a fresh worktree first (the outlives-its-caller case).

    Resume semantics: **one live session per worktree**. If a ``wt-<id>`` mux
    session already exists, this does NOT spawn a duplicate -- it reports the
    existing session (``created=false``), honoring "to act in an occupied space,
    interrogate the occupant or embody a fresh space." Otherwise it creates the
    session detached (never attaching -- the operator or Neuron Forge attaches
    later). An optional ``--seed`` is injected as the first interactive turn via
    ``send-keys`` once Copilot is ready. Handoff cutover uses native
    ``-i`` startup instead because its attached successor does not
    need embody's post-launch bridge verification.

    Verification: the caller confirms the embodiment by polling
    ``agent-bridge live-sessions?worktree_id=<id>`` -- the bundled extension
    auto-registers the new session. ``--verify-timeout`` optionally waits here
    for the mux session to come up before returning.

    worktree at an arbitrary path (there is no shared "root" in git's model),
    the current worktree is identifiable from anywhere inside it, regardless of
    where it lives on disk. This keeps inference correct across a
    ``worktree_root`` layout change: worktrees created under an older root are
    still resolved (copilot-extensions#59).

    Resolution order (each root-independent; the legacy single-root scan is
    only a last resort):
      1. **git's own identity** -- ``git rev-parse --git-dir`` under a linked
         worktree is ``.../.git/worktrees/<name>``; ``<name>`` is the tracking
         ID. Authoritative even when the tracking YAML is briefly absent.
      2. **tracked-path match** -- match CWD against each record's recorded
         ``worktree_path`` (:func:`tracking.find_worktree_id_by_cwd`,
         deepest-match wins).
      3. **legacy ``worktree_root`` prefix scan** -- the pre-fix single-root
         assumption, kept only for safety.

# managed session, Picker, or active list consumer needs it, and idle-exits when
# every root goes away.  It is
# **default-on (opt-out** via ``AGENT_WORKTREES_STATUS_MONITOR=0``) -- when
# disabled, each session runs its own per-session updater (a-la-carte: the inline
# path stays correct with no daemon).  Single-active on the host via a liveness

    ``abandoned`` so a crashed/missed settlement can never freeze the owner's

    * **gone** -- the child's local record is absent, or its status is terminal
      (``finalized``/``orphaned``); an active child (a live holder may still be
      working) is *not* gone. A cross-machine child is not judgeable here

    * **safe** -- a **finalized** child is provably safe (its finalize verified
      content upstream). An ``orphaned`` child (push failed) is *unsafe*. A gone,
      **non-terminal** child (``active``/``pushed`` but its dir removed -- the
      crashed-holder case) is proven safe only when its branch content already
      landed on its project upstream (:func:`_child_branch_merged`); otherwise it
      is *unproven* and left intact.

    So the sweep reclaims the "child finalized but the parent's claim was never
    flipped" gap (a missed/failed ``_settle_parent_obligation``) **and** the
    crashed-but-merged holder, never abandoning on a guess. **Dry-run by

    orphans plus untracked / path-missing leaks (issue #713) -- **but only once

    finalized-from-inside session whose Copilot is still working (you finalized
    the PR but the agent is mid-task, or a scheduled prompt is pending) would be
    killed the moment it's unattended; closing a tab is meant to *preserve* a

    (:func:`_sweep_orphans_on_exit`, #2149) -- so idle orphans are reaped on a
    natural cadence with **no persistent timer or daemon**.

    ``only_id`` restricts the sweep to a **single** worktree's session; the exact

    - a terminal client is **attached** (a human is using it),
    - its worktree record is ``kind: system`` (daemon-owned), or
    - its worktree is still **active** (tracked, dir present), or

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Orphaned launcher-shell reaper (copilot-extensions #102)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# After a worktree session ends cleanly its launcher shells (the pwsh running
# launch-session.ps1 and the `python -m agent_worktrees` waiter) exit with it.
# But a *force-closed* terminal (window closed with the X, a dropped SSH pipe)
# can strand them: the console dies, the shells are re-parented away from a now-
# dead pid, nothing runs under them -- yet they pin memory indefinitely. This
# sweep reclaims those, closing the same intent as the mux reaper
# (visions/agent-fabric §Features/reclaim-idle-process).
#
# SAFETY -- this KILLS processes, so it is engineered to fail SAFE. A live
# telemetry sampler was once wrongly killed because a non-elevated query made a
# hidden scheduled-task service (blank command line, exited parent) look exactly
# like an orphan. The lesson is baked in as independent layers, EVERY one of
# which must pass before a pid is even a candidate:
#   1. POSITIVE signature only. A pid is a candidate ONLY if its command line
#      positively matches an agent-worktrees launcher marker. A service with a
#      blank/absent command line can NEVER match -- we never reap "things that
#      merely look orphaned".
#   2. Service/daemon veto. A session-0 (service) pid, or one whose command line
#      bears a daemon/service/ACP marker, is skipped even if it matched (1).
#   3. Liveness gate. A shell with a live descendant (copilot/node, or a mux
#      client) is a LIVE session and is always spared.
#   4. Self-preservation. The reaper never touches its own process tree.
#   5. Orphan + idle gates. Only a shell whose parent has exited AND that has
#      been alive past the grace window is eligible.
#   6. Dry-run by DEFAULT. Unlike the mux reaper, nothing is killed unless the
#      caller explicitly passes --yes; the default is a report.

    whose work is already landed -- the ``finalized`` / merged / git-COMPLETED
    ones the manual ``cleanup`` would remove -- so they stop accumulating without
    a background service or a manual sweep. Run at the same two lifecycle
    boundaries (picker launch + session end).

    Safety reuses the EXACT manual-cleanup decision so the cadence can never be
    more aggressive than an explicit ``cleanup``: :func:`prune.cleanup_disposition`
    with the conservative flags (``include_unused=False``,

    which now also releases a provably-dead owner's claims), a follow-up-flagged
    or paired-pending worktree, and anything dirty/wip/unmerged are all spared.

    grace window** (default :data:`gc.SESSION_GC_GRACE_SECS`, 48h) and has no live
    bound session or live/attached mux. No network fetch is done (the cadence
    must be fast and offline-safe), so a merge not yet locally provable simply
    waits for a later pass -- the sweep never collects on unproven state.

    Returns ``{removed: [{id, reason}], skipped: [{id, reason}]}``. Never raises
    for control-flow; the caller wraps it best-effort. The kill-switch
    (:func:`auto_clean_enabled`) is checked by the cadence callers, not here, so

      so a same-version content drift (a dev checkout, or a marketplace artifact
      whose stamp lagged) is repaired. The installer force-reinstalls the
      package, so fresh bytes always land.

    The self-identifying, agent-driven counterpart to the ``sessionStart``
    ``register-session`` hook. ``register-session`` binds once at start from the
    payload cwd; a session that began life elsewhere (a bare/HOME-cwd resume, a
    spawned cutover successor, an ACP/STDIO launch that lands at ``$HOME``) is
    never registered and leaves its worktree looking unowned -- and the CLI has no
    cwd-change hook to re-bind when the agent later moves into the worktree.

    So the agent *declares* its worktree by running this verb from within it
    (``--worktree-dir`` defaults to the process cwd). We resolve identity the way
    a deliberate tool subprocess can -- the session id from ``--session-id`` or the
    ``COPILOT_AGENT_SESSION_ID`` env the CLI sets for tool calls, the mux pane from
    ``--pane`` or ``TMUX_PANE``/``PSMUX_PANE`` -- and fold into the *same*
    idempotent ``tracking.register_session`` the hook uses (which also completes a
    pending handoff predecessor<->successor link and initializes the head). Binding
    is what brings the worktree's live tracking to life, so we (re)assert the
    status-updater exactly as the hook does. The binding reflects what the agent
