"""Remote git-ref mirror for :mod:`claim_history`'s local ownership ledger
(worktree-claims-transitive-finalization Phase 3b's remote-mirroring item).

:mod:`claim_history` is a single machine-local JSONL file
(``logs/claim-history.jsonl``) -- durable across a worktree's own cleanup,
but gone the moment the MACHINE itself is reimaged/retired, and invisible to
any other machine wanting to audit a PR's full ownership trail. This module
mirrors each ``pr``-kind resource's event history to its own append-only Git
ref on the same shared store repo :mod:`lease_store`/:mod:`lease_config`
already use for cross-machine lease coordination (new namespace
``refs/agent-worktrees/claim-history/v1``, same account-scoped auth): a
plain linear chain of empty-tree commits, one per recorded event, oldest at
the root.

**Deliberately a separate, explicit, opt-in sweep -- never synchronous with
a live claim mutation.** Every :mod:`claim_history` write happens inline
during an ordinary claim operation; adding a live network fetch+push to
each one would add real latency and a new failure surface for a durability
concern that tolerates eventual (not immediate) consistency. Instead,
:func:`sync_pending` is wired into ``agent-worktrees gc
--mirror-claim-history`` (opt-in, network + force-push, the same posture
Phase 5's ``--lease-gc`` established for this same store).

**Globally unique event identity, not local position alone.** Every event
pushed here carries a ``(ledger_id, seq)`` pair as its durable identity:
``seq`` is the event's own 0-based position within its resource's full
LOCAL event sequence (stable forever -- the ledger is append-only); ``
ledger_id`` is a random id minted once for this machine's own ledger
incarnation (:func:`_ledger_id`, persisted alongside the ledger file
itself). ``seq`` alone is only unique WITHIN one ledger's lifetime -- two
independent machines' first events for the same PR both get ``seq=0``, and
a reimaged machine starting a fresh ledger would collide with its own
earlier incarnation's ``seq=0`` too. ``ledger_id`` discriminates both
cases; a lost/absent ledger file (no prior incarnation at all, or a
genuine reimage) mints a fresh one.

**One verified remote snapshot per operation.** Reading "what does the
remote already have" and "what tip do I compare-and-swap against" from two
SEPARATE network round trips (an ``ls-remote`` then a later ``fetch``, or
vice versa) lets a concurrent writer move the ref in between, producing a
torn read: a push could adopt a parent that doesn't actually match the
content it just inspected. :meth:`ClaimHistoryMirror._fetch_chain` is the
ONE place that reads the remote; it returns a tip oid and the fully parsed
chain from that EXACT oid together, and re-validates after its own fetch
that the ref didn't move underneath it. Every other method (``fetch``,
``push_batch``) is built on top of that single verified read -- never a
second independent query for "the same" state.

**Batched, not per-event.** :meth:`ClaimHistoryMirror.push_batch` pushes
every still-missing event for one resource as ONE linear chain of commits
in a SINGLE network push (one verified snapshot read, then one
compare-and-swap write) -- not one fetch+push round trip per event, which
would turn an N-event backfill into roughly N times the resource's own
growing chain length worth of commit reads. :meth:`~ClaimHistoryMirror.push`
(a single event) is a thin wrapper over a one-entry batch, kept for
callers that only ever have one event in hand.

**Stateless by design -- no local sync cursor, no local lock.** An earlier
revision of this module persisted a local JSON "how many events have I
already pushed" cursor, serialized by a local advisory lock -- a design
with real gaps (the lock's own setup could raise and escape the sweep; a
crash between a landed push and its own checkpoint write could re-push or
skip events; a cursor derived from a PROJECT-FILTERED list silently
drifted when that filter's output changed shape). :func:`sync_pending`
instead always asks the REMOTE directly which identities a resource's
chain already has, and only pushes what's missing -- two overlapping
sweeps need no local coordination at all; one wins the compare-and-swap,
the other's retry re-reads and finds its own events already there.

**Durable project attribution.** A sweep must never upload one project's
PR references/session IDs/notes to a DIFFERENT project's configured store.
Every event :mod:`claim_history` records now carries an explicit
``project`` whenever its caller has one to pass (the OWNING worktree's own
``WorktreeRecord.repo`` -- never ambient config, which can genuinely
differ from the record actually being mutated, e.g. an ``--owner-ref``
cross-project write or a daemon dispatch with no project context of its
own). A legacy event recorded before this field existed, or written by a
caller with no record-derived project in hand, falls back to
:func:`_current_project_worktree_ids`'s live-tracking-record heuristic
(lossy once a worktree is reaped, but fail-closed: never exported when
neither signal vouches for it).

**Reading.** :func:`fetch_remote_history` is a plain, read-only,
best-effort pull of one resource's mirrored chain -- safe to call any time
(e.g. ``claims history <ref> --remote``) to see what other machines have
mirrored, whether or not THIS machine has ever pushed to that same ref
itself.
