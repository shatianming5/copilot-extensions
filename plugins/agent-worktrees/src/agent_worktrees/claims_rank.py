"""Shared claims-prominence ranking (picker-venue-pivots effort).

Given a worktree's claim ledger (``tracking_claims.ResourceClaim`` entries,
or equivalent plain dicts), selects and orders the "1-2 prominent" claims a
Picker row's claims-list column should show -- one ranking every
claims-showing pivot (Worktrees, Tasks, Codespaces, Containers) consumes
identically, rather than each pivot inventing its own selection. See
``visions/venue-pivots-ux``'s "Claims pecking order" concept in the
``copilot-extensions`` repo for the full design rationale.

Organizing principle: **human-mappable, quick-find first** -- an entity a
human can recognize and act on by its own external identity (a PR number, a
bug number) outranks one that is only ever meaningful inside this fabric (a
dispatch task id has no independently-referenceable identity outside it).

Starting order (operator-supplied 2026-09-21; explicitly tunable). Two ways
to tune it: edit ``DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER`` below directly (repo-local), or
-- since 2026-09-21 -- let any installed plugin **contribute** its own
priority via a ``claim-kinds/*.json`` drop-in, discovered by the companion
``claim_kinds_registry`` module and passed into ``rank_claims``'s
``pecking_order=`` parameter. Either way every consumer (Worktrees, Tasks,
Codespaces, Containers) picks up the same order identically -- this module
itself never reads a plugin drop-in (stays pure/I/O-free; see below).

    PR > bug/issue > effort > bridge > CodeSpace/container > child worktree
    > machine SSH > dispatch task

**Kind-vocabulary gap (grounded against the real code, 2026-09-21):**
``claims_cli._claims_add``'s ``valid_kinds`` today is only
``{worktree, codespace, container, ssh, workdir, pr, task}`` -- "bug"/
"issue", "effort", "bridge", and "session" (added 2026-09-29) are **not yet
claimable kinds**. This module ranks whatever kind is actually present in a
ledger; a kind this repo cannot yet produce a claim for simply never
appears here (no fabrication). Adding a "bug"/"issue" claim kind is a
prerequisite of the vision's own workspace-PR auto-claim work, not
something this module does.

**Deliberately pure, no I/O.** This module never scans a filesystem, reads
a plugin's installed files, or imports anything beyond the standard library
-- it is pecking-order *arithmetic* only. A plugin contributing a new
claimable kind (and the priority it should rank at) is a *discovery*
concern, owned by the sibling ``claim_kinds_registry`` module (a ``.d/``
drop-in scanner mirroring the Worktree Picker's own ``pivots/<name>.json``
contribution pattern) -- that module does the I/O and hands this one a
plain ``{kind: priority}`` mapping via ``pecking_order=``.

    ``active_pr`` (an optional ``{repo, number, state}`` mapping -- the

    resolves) is backfilled as a synthetic live ``pr`` claim when

    migration. Never backfills a merged/closed PR -- :func:`summarize_claims`
