"""Optional source-worktree attribution markers for PR bodies/comments.

By default (codename-attribution-by-default), a PR opened by agent-worktrees
carries a public-safe marker naming **only** the worktree's assigned codename
(see the third mode below) -- no machine, worktree-id, session, or head SHA.
When a closed-circuit repo instead opts in with ``pr.source_attribution:
true``, the marker carries the raw **source worktree** (+ machine / session /
head SHA) -- this must stay off for a public repo, since hidden PR metadata
is still public and raw machine/worktree/session identifiers are
inappropriate there. Later pushed heads are published as dedicated marker
comments so mutable metadata never replaces the authored PR description.
Consumers use the newest marker across both surfaces.

The marker is a single HTML comment, invisible in rendered Markdown:

    <!-- agent-worktrees:source worktree=<id> machine=<m> session=<sid> head=<sha> -->

The default third mode, ``pr.source_attribution: codename`` (effort
``pr-attribution-codenames`` Phase 4), is for a public repo that still wants
author-side traceability: it emits :func:`build_codename_marker` instead --
**only** the worktree's assigned codename, no machine/worktree-id/session/
head. The codename decodes to nothing on its own; the author resolves it back
to a worktree locally (``resolve --codename``) or, on another machine, via an
automated cross-machine SSH scan (Phase 3, ``codename_reverse_lookup.py``) --
a match on a different machine reports it (fails closed) rather than
attempting a remote launch.

      explicitly opted in has reviewed this repo's current custom
      vocabulary; the bare implicit default never does (the exact

      ``codename_source != "custom"`` shape (round-12 finding): an
      unrecognized stored value must never be silently treated as safe.

    This helper does NOT decide whether ``attribution`` itself resolves to
    ``"codename"``, nor does it handle the independent raw-marker

# ── Branch-name leak class (effort ``pr-attribution-codenames`` Phase 5) ────
#
# The hidden PR-body marker above is not the only way a private identifier can
# reach a public repo: the PR HEAD's *branch name itself* is public, and one
# has been observed published as the literal ``worktree/<id>`` name -- the raw
# worktree id (which embeds the authoring machine and a creation timestamp)
# landing directly in a public branch name. Neither ``head_scheme`` default
# publishes that name on its own (see the effort README's Context section);
# the leak comes from an override -- an explicit ``--branch``, an
# existing-PR-reuse, or a ``head_pattern`` containing ``{machine}``/
# ``{worktree_id}`` -- so the fix validates the *effective* resolved head at
# the publish boundary, not just the scheme default.

# Matches a bare ``{machine}``/``{worktree_id}`` token AND any valid
# ``str.format`` conversion/format-spec variant of it (e.g. ``{machine!s}``,
# ``{machine:>10}``, ``{machine:{width}}`` with a NESTED replacement field)
# -- ``pr_head_name`` renders ``head_pattern`` with ``str.format(**tokens)``,
# which accepts all of these and substitutes the SAME underlying value.
# Field names are extracted with :class:`string.Formatter` (never a regex)
# because ``str.format``'s mini-language allows nested replacement fields
# inside a format spec (``{machine:{width}}``) that a regex cannot reliably
# recognize; ``Formatter.parse`` is the same parser ``str.format`` itself
# uses, so it can never miss (or misidentify) a field ``str.format`` would
# actually substitute. Used by ``validate_effective_head``'s own defensive
# "unresolved marker" check against an ALREADY-RESOLVED head string (any
# caller's chosen branch name, not specifically a rendered ``head_pattern``)
# -- a literal ``{worktree_id}`` surviving there is suspicious regardless of
# whether that token is part of ``pr_head_name``'s actual rendering contract.

# The static config-only audit (``head_pattern_leak_risk``) inspects a
# *configured* ``head_pattern`` string, not a resolved head -- so it must
# only flag tokens ``pr_head_name`` can ACTUALLY substitute.
# ``pr_head_name``'s token dict is exactly ``prefix``/``slug``/``suffix``/
# ``username``/``machine`` -- it has no ``worktree_id`` key, so a pattern
# containing ``{worktree_id}`` raises ``KeyError`` inside ``str.format`` and
# is caught, falling back to the safe legacy default pattern; that literal
# text never reaches a published branch. Flagging it as risky here would be
