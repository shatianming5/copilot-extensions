"""Pull-request provider plugins -- the interface and shared helpers.

A *provider* owns one job: "create the PR on the hosting service and return
its ``{url, number}``".  Transport is the provider's own CLI (``gh`` for
GitHub, ``az`` for Azure DevOps) or ``curl`` against the REST API (Gitea has
no installed CLI) -- deliberately **no Python HTTP dependency** is added to
the plugin.  The provider is selected per-repo by the existing ``provider``
config value (``gitea`` / ``github`` / ``azure-devops``).

Credentials resolve, in order: ``pr.token_command`` (a shell command that
prints a token -- how the multi-machine system points at its vault), then ``pr.token_env``
(an env-var name); GitHub additionally falls back to ``gh`` auth.
