"""Background update *staging* for the launch path (issue #1430).

The launcher used to run the whole update/reconcile chain **serially before**
showing the Picker: ``copilot plugin update agent-worktrees`` (a ~1.3-1.9s
marketplace network call, even when already at latest) + ``pre-launch`` +
``reconcile-plugins`` x2. That fixed cost is paid on every boot, before the
Picker can paint.

This module implements the **stage** half of the Copilot-style
*stage-then-join* model: run the slow marketplace download **in the background
while the Picker is open**, so the operator's think-time hides it. The launcher
then **joins** (waits for) this stage and **applies** any pending update *after*
the Picker closes and *before* the psmux/Copilot handoff.

Critical safety constraint (why stage != apply): the Picker (``resolve``) runs
from the **installed runtime slot** ``~/.agent-worktrees/versions/<ver>`` (resolved
via the junction-free ``current-version`` marker; #1106). This stage
only touches the **marketplace payload dir**
(``~/.copilot/installed-plugins/copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees``) via
``copilot plugin update`` -- it never rewrites the running venv -- so it is safe
to run concurrently with the Picker. The *apply* (installer: payload->runtime +
pip) must run from the shell after the Picker exits; it lives in the launch
wrappers, not here.

Single-flight: a lockfile (PID + start epoch, with stale reclaim) ensures two
near-simultaneous launches never both hit the marketplace / race the payload
write. A second launch whose stage finds the lock held simply records
``skipped: locked`` and exits -- the in-flight stage's result is authoritative.

The heavier, order-sensitive steps (the ``pre-launch`` self-update installers
and the two-pass ``reconcile-plugins``) stay in the shell apply step; this
stage only pre-computes the cheap ``pre-launch`` *plan* so the join can skip a
redundant spawn when nothing is stale.
