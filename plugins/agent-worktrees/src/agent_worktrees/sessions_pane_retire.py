    stalled-predecessor diagnostic (``handoffs-check``), never another blind
    spawn on top. Confirmed live: worktree b431 stacked 20+ successor panes
    over one hour on a single token, none ever reaching a confirmed candidate
    -- ``_monitor_pending_handoff_request`` had no memory that it had already
    tried, so every ~3-4 minute sweep (the claim lock's own staleness window)

    """Retire a specific pane by asking its Copilot to quit cleanly.

    Copilot CLI exits on a **double Ctrl-C** ~600 ms apart (a single one does
    little) -- its native clean-quit path (cf. :func:`graceful_quit_mux_session`).
    Unlike that session-scoped helper, this targets one ``pane_id`` so it retires
    the OLD Copilot after a cutover without touching the successor (the session's
    new active pane). Falls back to ``kill-pane`` if it does not exit in time.

    **Escalation ladder (up to three Ctrl-C).** Two interrupts is the common
    case, but some Copilot states swallow the second (mid-render, a modal, a busy
    turn flushing state) -- so after the double-interrupt we wait a brief
    ``escalate_after`` window and, only if the pane is still alive, deliver a
    conditional **third** Ctrl-C before the hard ``kill-pane`` fallback. This
    mirrors :func:`graceful_quit_mux_session` (a76ab47 / #2614) so a stubborn old
    pane is retired cleanly (persisting session state) instead of being severed,
    which is the failure mode behind a lingering un-retired pane (#3946).

    Returns ``{ok, pane, gone, method}`` where ``method`` is ``already-gone``,
    ``graceful``, ``hard``, or ``failed``.
