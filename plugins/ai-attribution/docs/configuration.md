# Configuration

The hook is safe without configuration. It reads the `sessionStart` JSON payload
from stdin and treats its `cwd` as the authoritative target. In every git
repository selected by that payload it emits the generic third-party disclosure
and public-sanitization policy; outside a git repository it emits `{}`.
Missing or malformed payloads are diagnosed and emit `{}` rather than falling
back to the hook process's working directory.

Configuration is inert data. The Bash and PowerShell hooks parse it directly
without sourcing, dot-sourcing, `eval`, command expansion, Python, jq, or YAML
modules.

## Grammar

- UTF-8 text, one setting per line.
- A setting is `key=value`; the first `=` separates key from value.
- Leading and trailing whitespace around the line, key, and value is ignored.
- Blank lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is `#` are ignored.
- Keys are case-sensitive.
- Values are literal data and are never executed. Each key still has the narrow
  value shape documented below; quotes, `$()`, backticks, semicolons, control
  characters, and other unsupported characters are diagnosed and rejected
  rather than copied into ambient context.
- A malformed line, empty key/value, unknown key, unauthorized key, or invalid
  enum value is diagnosed on stderr and ignored.
- Each config is limited to 65,536 bytes and 200 lines. A config over either
  limit is diagnosed once and ignored in full.
- Symlinked target-repository configs are rejected. PowerShell also rejects
  unresolved or reparse-point custom-instruction directories and configs rather
  than trusting a path that Windows PowerShell 5.1 cannot robustly resolve.

## Keys

| Key | Authority | Repeatable | Meaning |
|-----|-----------|------------|---------|
| `disclosure=third-party` | Operator only | No | Default: require disclosure for a contribution that comments on, replies to, or reviews a PR/issue/thread another party authored or participates in -- in any repository, public or private, including one the operator owns. A self-authored contribution with no other party's content or participation yet, or an inline reply directed at an automated review bot's own comment thread, may omit it unless explicitly requested otherwise. |
| `disclosure=always` | Operator only | No | Tightening: require disclosure for every contribution, including a self-authored one, a bot-reply, or one on an `internal_host`. Once selected by a discovered layer, a later layer cannot weaken it. |
| `owned_account=<public host>/<public account>` | Operator only | Yes | Host-qualified public forge account used as a local remote hint, for example `github.com/example-owner`. Host and owner must both match the remote, case-insensitively; the value remains a hint, not proof of who authored any specific PR/issue/thread within it. |
| `internal_host=<host>` | Operator only | Yes | An operator-only forge host (for example a self-hosted Gitea instance) where every participant is already a known operator/facility identity. Under the default `disclosure=third-party` policy, this is a blanket exemption regardless of audience -- not a self-authorship inference -- resolved against the configured push target(s), not the fetch source. `disclosure=always` still requires disclosure there too. |
| `contribution_guide=<repo-relative path>` | Target repo only | Yes | Additive pointer to an existing regular file under the target repository, with no symlink/reparse-point path component. It cannot override plugin/operator policy. |

Contribution-guide paths use `/` separators and narrow ASCII path segments
containing only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`. Absolute paths, empty
segments, `.` or `..` segments, traversal, backslashes, Markdown syntax,
controls, non-ASCII text, missing files, and values longer than 160 characters
are rejected. At most four valid paths are accepted, so repository data cannot
consume the shared ambient-context budget.

There is deliberately no key for literal private identifiers, credentials, or
policy replacement, and no key for hosts/accounts other than the public
ownership hints and internal-host exemptions above.

## Discovery and precedence

The hook starts with safe plugin defaults, then reads:

1. Canonical personal config: `$HOME/.copilot/ai-attribution.conf`.
2. Platform config home:
   - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ai-attribution/config.conf` when
     `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set;
   - `%APPDATA%\ai-attribution\config.conf` on Windows otherwise;
   - `$HOME/.config/ai-attribution/config.conf` on POSIX otherwise.
3. `ai-attribution.conf` directly under each path in
   `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`, in environment order. The platform path
   separator (`:` on POSIX, `;` on Windows) and comma are both accepted,
   matching the customization scanner convention. Each directory is resolved
   without shell evaluation. Entries at or beneath the current repository root
   are diagnosed and skipped, so a target repository cannot self-promote its
   own data to operator authority through the environment.
4. `<session-start-repo>/.github/ai-attribution.conf`, with only
   repo-delegable keys.

Operator values are additive/tightening: accounts and internal hosts
accumulate, and `disclosure=always` cannot be reset. Target-repo configuration
is considered last only so its additive contribution-guide facts appear in the
emitted kernel. Safety, publication, attribution, ownership, and sanitization
keys are not repo-delegable and are ignored there.

## Ownership and internal-host inference

The hook resolves the local git remote to inspect using the same effective
push-remote precedence Git itself uses for `git push`: a per-branch
`branch.<name>.pushRemote` override, then the repo-wide `remote.pushDefault`,
then the current branch's tracked `branch.<name>.remote`, then `origin`. If
none of those resolves a remote -- including the case of several configured
remotes with no tracking/override naming one -- the push target is left
**unresolved**, matching Git's own refusal to guess (`git push` itself fails
with no configured push destination in that case). An unresolved remote can
never grant the `internal_host` exemption: per operator policy, disclosure
defaults on, and only an explicit, unambiguous, safe match waives it -- never
an inferred or guessed one. It makes no network call and performs no
authentication.

For `owned_account`, both host and owner from that resolved remote's **push**
URL (not the fetch source -- a configured `pushurl` can differ) must match one
host-qualified value, case-insensitively. A bare owner shared across forges
never unlocks the self-authored carve-out on its own -- that carve-out still
depends on who this specific contribution actually addresses, not solely on
repository ownership.

The resolved host is also compared, case-insensitively, against every
configured `internal_host`. A match is a blanket disclosure exemption
regardless of audience; it is independent of (and checked before) the
ownership hint above. When the resolved remote has multiple configured push
URLs (`git remote set-url --add --push`), every one of them must resolve to a
configured `internal_host` for the exemption to apply -- one external mirror
destination is enough to require disclosure.

**Known limitation (accepted, mitigated by a conditional hint, not solved):**
this heuristic reflects the local git push configuration, not necessarily the
actual host a PR, issue, or review gets published against -- a
fork/triangular workflow can push to one remote while its PR opens against a
different (forge-determined, not purely git-config) upstream. The plugin
makes no network call to resolve this precisely, so the emitted `internal_host`
guidance is deliberately **conditional, not absolute**: it states the exemption
applies to a contribution that actually publishes on this resolved push host,
and directs the agent to confirm the specific surface being published to (the
PR/issue/comment's own host) matches before relying on it, disclosing
otherwise. Combined with the fail-closed resolution above (the exemption only
ever activates on an unambiguous local match), this leaves the residual risk
at "an agent trusts the hint without checking the actual publish target in a
fork/triangular workflow" -- a one-step verification the published guidance
text itself prompts -- rather than an unconditional assertion that disclosure
is never required.

The resulting hints are anchored only to the repository named by the
`sessionStart` payload. Both must be re-derived before publishing to any
other repository. A validated configured host/account match, or a validated
`internal_host` match, may be named in ambient context; an unconfigured or
private remote owner is never echoed there.

Missing, invalid, or nonmatching ownership is classified as addressing another
party by default, without copying the literal owner. Even a match is only a
hint, and the emitted guidance requires verifying who this specific
contribution actually addresses before using the self-authored/bot-reply
carve-out.

## Static fallback for launchers without plugin hooks

Some launch paths do not execute plugin hooks. The canonical minimal fallback is
`../instructions/publication-safety.instructions.md`, declared by
`../instruction-projections.json`. The `ai-attribution-setup` skill routes
adopters through the projection sync and scan commands owned by
`customizing-copilot:reviewing-customizations`; setup guidance must not carry a
second prose copy.

Do not remove or shrink a fuller pre-existing static publication policy until
the projected fallback is installed and every known hook-less launch path for
the adopting repository has been validated. The scanner reports old
`ai-attribution:static-fallback` regions as legacy and never removes them.
Once both preconditions hold, remove only redundant prose manually and preserve
stricter repository-owned invariants.

## Failure behavior

Malformed or unreadable optional config never blocks startup. The hook writes
one concise diagnostic per rejected bounded config and retains the safe generic
policy. Malformed or missing launch payload emits `{}` with a concise
diagnostic. The hook always writes exactly one JSON object to stdout.
