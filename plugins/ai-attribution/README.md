# ai-attribution

> Keep publication, sanitization, and AI-attribution safety active wherever an
> agent works.

`ai-attribution` is a payload-only Copilot CLI plugin. A dependency-free
`sessionStart` hook writes a concise, attributable policy kernel to the exact
session's guidance file and emits only `{}`, while a checked-in instruction
pointer tells the agent where to read it. An on-demand skill supplies the
detailed publication workflow. There is no runtime, venv, daemon, binstub,
installer, network call, or authentication requirement.

The plugin realizes the
[`harness-guidance`](../../visions/harness-guidance/README.md) vision's
authoritative ownership, concise context kernel, portable operator policy, and
resilient safety boundary through the exact-session dynamic-guidance pattern.

## What it does (and how to use it)

| Entry point | When it applies | Result |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| `sessionStart` hook | Every session whose launch payload names a valid session and git repository | Writes the generic publication-safety kernel, operator tightening, host-qualified local remote hint, and additive target-repo contribution-guide paths to the exact session file; emits `{}`. The underlying policy computation is cached per repository (bounded TTL) so a session in an already-seen, unchanged repository skips re-spawning it. |
| checked-in instruction projections | Every adopting repository | Preserve a static publication-safety fallback and a load-before-action pointer to the exact-session guidance file. |
| `ai-attribution` skill | Preparing or auditing code, issues, pull requests, comments, releases, docs, or other published artifacts | Walks through audience and ownership classification, disclosure placement, public writing, sanitization, and live post-publication verification. |
| `ai-attribution-setup` skill | Adopting or repairing the plugin in a repository | Idempotently reconciles the marked always-on fallback, configures host-qualified operator policy, and validates hook-less launch paths. |

The ambient policy requires agents to:

- determine the audience of this specific contribution (self-authored with no
  other party's content or participation yet, a reply to an automated review
  bot's own comment thread, or a response to another party's PR/issue/thread)
  and whether the target host is configured as operator-only (`internal_host`)
  before publishing;
- prominently disclose AI assistance at the top of a contribution addressing
  another party -- in every repository, public or private, including one the
  operator owns -- even when it also engages with bot findings;
- omit disclosure by default only for a genuinely self-authored contribution,
  an inline bot-comment-only reply, or one on a configured `internal_host`,
  unless the operator explicitly requests it or policy tightens it to always;
- keep public artifacts persona-neutral and scrub private identifiers,
  credentials, paths, hosts, accounts, record IDs, and private rationale;
- write public contributions in first-person singular and follow target-repo
  conventions;
- audit the live published surface after publication.

Local git remotes provide ownership and host hints only (resolved from the
configured **push** target, not the fetch source, so an internal fetch mirror
with an external push destination is never silently exempted). No remote
inference is treated as proof, and uncertainty uses the third-party policy.

### Typical setup

1. Add this marketplace and enable the plugin at the desired Copilot settings
   scope:

   ```bash
   copilot plugin marketplace add ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions
   copilot plugin install ai-attribution@copilot-extensions
   ```

2. Invoke **`ai-attribution-setup`** in the adopting repository. It installs or
   updates the stable marked fallback in the repository's always-on instructions
   and configures host-qualified operator ownership policy.
3. Optionally add the target repo's additive
   `.github/ai-attribution.conf`, following
   [`examples/repository.ai-attribution.conf`](examples/repository.ai-attribution.conf).
4. Launch Copilot in a git repository. The pointer loads the exact-session file
   written by the hook; invoke **`ai-attribution`** for the detailed workflow
   before publication.

The safe generic policy is emitted when no config exists. See
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the exact `key=value`
grammar, keys, precedence, authority boundaries, and diagnostics.

## What this plugin provides - and what it doesn't

**Provides**

- A concise, stable-owner-marked ambient policy kernel.
- Safe default behavior with no configuration.
- Portable operator policy from the user config home and
  `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`.
- Narrow validation before repository paths, configured accounts, or parsed
  remote identities can enter ambient context.
- Host-qualified local git remote hints without network access.
- A detailed publication and sanitization skill.
- An explicit setup skill for the stable static fallback and operator policy.
- Equivalent dependency-free Bash and PowerShell writers and policy emitters.
- A retained emitter seam for direct plugin-owned `additionalContext` after
  native host composition is proven at the supported version floor.

**Does not provide**

- Proof of repository ownership. Remote parsing is deliberately only a hint.
- Secret or private-identifier storage. Literal private identifier lists do not
  belong in public repo config.
- Automatic publication, hosting-service API access, or live-surface fetching.
  The agent uses the target repository's normal tools and workflow.
- Enforcement by mutating a contribution. The hook supplies policy; the agent
  applies it.
- Mutation without an explicit setup action. The `ai-attribution-setup` skill is
  the idempotent adoption mechanism for the fallback and operator policy.

## Dependencies & assumptions

- Copilot CLI must support command-type `sessionStart` hooks and expose
  `sessionId` in the launch payload.
- `git` must be available for repository gating and local remote inspection.
- On POSIX, `bash` is required. On Windows, PowerShell 5.1 or `pwsh` is
  required.
- The plugin is independently installable and assumes no sibling plugin,
  Python, jq, YAML module, network access, or authenticated account.
- The hook receives a JSON `sessionStart` payload on stdin and uses its `cwd`;
  process working directory is deliberately not authoritative.

## What's in this plugin

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hooks.json` | Registers the output-free cross-platform exact-session writer. |
| `session-context.json` | Proves the writer is restart-safe and emits no model context. |
| `scripts/emit-policy.sh` | Dependency-free Bash config parser, git gate, ownership hint, and JSON emitter. |
| `scripts/emit-policy.ps1` | PowerShell implementation with parity-equivalent semantics and output. |
| `scripts/write-session-guidance.*` | Cross-platform hook wrappers for the exact-session writer. |
| `scripts/write_session_guidance.py` | Validates session identity and atomically writes the session guidance file. |
| `skills/ai-attribution/SKILL.md` | Source of truth for the detailed on-demand publication workflow. |
| `skills/ai-attribution-setup/SKILL.md` | Idempotent fallback adoption and operator-policy setup workflow. |
| `docs/configuration.md` | Config grammar, keys, precedence, authority boundary, ownership inference, and failure behavior. |
| `examples/*.conf` | Generic operator and target-repository config examples. |
| `tests/test_emit_policy.py` | Hook behavior, safety, exact-output, size, and parity tests. |

## Troubleshooting, contributing & issues

- **The hook emits `{}`:** that is the required output-free contract. Inspect the
  exact session's `instructions/ai-attribution/session-guidance.instructions.md`
  file to diagnose unavailable policy.
- **A setting is ignored:** read stderr. Malformed, unknown, invalid, and
  unauthorized keys are diagnosed and ignored without weakening safe defaults.
- **Ownership is unresolved or unexpectedly treated as addressing another
  party:** configure the public forge account as
  `owned_account=<host>/<account>` in operator scope; do not place it in
  target-repo config. Still verify who this specific contribution actually
  addresses before using the self-authored/bot-reply carve-out -- repository
  ownership is a supporting hint, not the deciding fact.
- **An internal-host repo still asks for disclosure:** configure the forge's
  host as `internal_host=<host>` in operator scope.
- **Guidance looks stale after a config/ownership change:** the computed
  policy is cached per repository for up to
  `AI_ATTRIBUTION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 3600s) under
  `~/.copilot/ai-attribution-cache/`, so the hook doesn't re-spawn the full
  policy computation on every session start for an answer that hasn't
  changed. Delete that cache directory, or set
  `AI_ATTRIBUTION_FORCE_REFRESH=1` for one session, to force an immediate
  recompute.
