"""Reap processes still running from a STALE (non-current) agent-mcp version slot.

An agent-mcp-local companion to the shared versioned-runtime primitive
(``scripts/versioned_runtime.py``). That primitive's ``gc`` only removes stale
version *directories*, and it deliberately *protects* any slot a live process
runs from -- so a leaked/orphaned bridge tree (or a warmth daemon) from a prior
version stays resident across an upgrade ("two runtime versions resident"). This
tool closes the gap: after a new version is activated, it terminates every
process still executing from a NON-current slot (and its tree), after which GC
can drop the now-idle dirs on its next pass.

It **reuses** the primitive's slot-attribution helpers (pid enumeration,
image/argv[0] -> slot mapping) rather than duplicating them, and lives in
agent-mcp only: the primitive is vendored byte-identically into every plugin and
must not carry a bridge-specific reaping policy.

Usage::

    reap_versions.py --root ~/.agent-mcp [--link-name .venv] [--json] [--exclude-pid PID ...]

    target actually *leads* (``pgid == pid``, e.g. a detached ``serve`` daemon
    or a standalone bridge that made its own group). For a stale process that is
    NOT its group's leader, we terminate the exact pid and walk its REAL
