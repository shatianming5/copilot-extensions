"""Thin per-session forwarder: the light client half of the #744 multiplexer.

Today every MCP session Copilot opens spawns a full ``agent-mcp bridge``
interpreter -- it parses config, builds credential injectors, constructs the
decorator pipeline, and connects the upstream, all per session. Run at 5-10
concurrent worktree sessions with several servers each, that is dozens of heavy
Python interpreters resident at once (the dominant process-count / RAM
multiplier the effort set out to remove).

This module is the replacement child. When a resident ``agent-mcp serve``
session-host is available it **attaches** a full MCP session there (the host owns
the upstream + decorator pipeline; see :mod:`agent_mcp.serve`) and then does
nothing but **pump bytes**: client->server JSON-RPC from its stdin into the
socket, server->client messages from the socket to its stdout. The happy path
imports only the standard library plus the stdlib-only, *asyncio-free*
:mod:`agent_mcp.sockio` -- crucially **not** ``asyncio`` (~7 MiB) nor the eager
package version (~8 MiB, now lazy) -- so the forwarder child is a ~13 MiB
interpreter versus a ~27 MiB ``agent-mcp bridge``. The heavy bridge tree is
imported **lazily, and only on the fallback path**.

The multiplexer is always **optional with a correct inline fallback**: if no host
is advertised, or the attach is refused, or multiplexing is disabled
(``AGENT_MCP_NO_MULTIPLEX`` / ``AGENT_MCP_NO_SERVE``), the forwarder runs the
exact same in-process :class:`~agent_mcp.bridge.Bridge` a plain
``agent-mcp bridge`` would -- so behaviour is identical whether or not a host is
present. Once a session is *attached*, a mid-session host death is **not** retried
as a fresh direct bridge (the MCP session's ``initialize`` + notification stream
can't be replayed); the forwarder exits and the runtime respawns it, which then
takes the fallback or a fresh attach cleanly.
