"""Shared MCP bridge session: the upstream connection + decorator pipeline for
one client, independent of how that client is attached.

Both the stdio bridge (``agent-mcp bridge``) and the resident ``serve``
session-host run a client's MCP session the same way -- its own upstream
connection, its own decorator :class:`~agent_mcp.pipeline.Pipeline`, and its own
server->client notification stream -- differing only in the client transport
(process stdio vs. the serve socket). Extracting it here lets the resident
session-host host **many** client sessions in one interpreter (the work-coalescing
multiplexer, #744) while the stdio bridge keeps running one per process.

The session writes every client-bound message (a response, a decorator-emitted
push, or an unsolicited upstream notification) through the injected
``write_to_client`` sink; the caller owns how that reaches the actual client.
