"""Decorator registry + pipeline construction.

A bridge's ``decorators:`` config is a list of ``{type: ..., <options>}`` mappings.
Decorators are listed **client -> upstream**: the first entry is closest to the
client (outermost), the last is closest to the upstream. Requests flow down the
list; responses bubble back up.

Recommended ordering: context-reducers that synthesize their own tools
(``defer``, ``code-mode``) go *first* (outermost), then cosmetic ``rename``, then
``filter``, then ``gate``, with ``storage`` *last* (innermost) so it sees real
payloads -- EXCEPT ``input_gate``, which must go even *after* ``storage`` AND
``rename`` (truly last/innermost of all; enforced by config validation, not
just documented). ``storage`` may rehydrate a ``$stream`` argument handle into
its real value on the way to upstream, and ``rename`` rewrites the
client-visible tool name back to the real upstream one -- ``input_gate``'s
``deny_when``/``match_tools`` must see those real, final values, not the
handle or the renamed name. See ``input_gate.py``'s module docstring for the
full placement rationale (including why it must also be below
``code-mode``/``defer``, whose synthesized sub-requests never reach decorators
above their own position).
