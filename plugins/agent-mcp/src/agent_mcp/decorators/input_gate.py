"""``input_gate`` decorator -- deny a tool call whose OWN arguments match a predicate.

``gate`` (see ``gate.py``) judges a call by an out-of-band **preflight** fact
(a different tool's response). Some authorization invariants instead need to
judge the call by its **own request arguments** -- e.g. "never let an
``update_incident`` call itself introduce the string ``ai-safe`` into a
``tags``/``title`` argument", so that a marker meant to be human-set can't be
self-granted by the same agent session that also reads gated content once the
marker is present.

Neither existing decorator can express that: ``filter`` is a static per-tool
allow/deny (no argument inspection at all), and ``transform`` only reshapes a
tool's **output**, never its input. ``input_gate`` closes that specific gap:
when a client calls one of ``match_tools``, it evaluates a boolean
``deny_when`` predicate over the call's **own arguments** (using the same
path/op mini-language as ``gate``'s ``allow_when`` -- see ``_predicate.py``)
and denies the call if it matches, before it ever reaches the upstream.

This is a narrow, single-purpose complement to ``gate``, not a replacement:
``gate`` decides "is this incident's OWN state safe to read"; ``input_gate``
decides "does this WRITE attempt introduce a marker/value it must never
introduce", independent of any preflight lookup.

```yaml
- type: input_gate
  match_tools: [update_incident]                # globs; which tools/call to gate
  deny_when:                                     # boolean predicate over the call's OWN args
    any:
      - { path: "tags[*]", matches: "(?i)^ai-safe$" }
      - { path: "title", matches: "(?i)(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_-])ai-safe([^A-Za-z0-9_-]|$)" }
  on_deny: error                                  # error | stub | drop (default: error)
  reason: "the ai-safe tag/keyword is human-only; an agent must never self-grant it"
```

Unlike ``gate`` (fail-closed on preflight error, since it protects a READ), a
predicate evaluation error here can only reasonably fail closed too --
``deny_when`` is evaluated purely locally (no network call), so there is no
transient-failure case to distinguish; a malformed predicate is a config bug,
not a runtime condition, and is caught by config validation instead
(:func:`agent_mcp.config._validate_input_gate` recursively validates the
``deny_when`` tree's shape and regexes at load time).

> **Placement -- put ``input_gate`` innermost (last in the ``decorators:``
> list, closest to the upstream). This is a HARD, config-validation-enforced
> requirement, not just a recommendation** (see
> ``config._validate_input_gate_position``). ``code-mode``/``defer`` synthesize
> their own ``tools/call`` sub-requests and forward them via the SAME ``nxt`` they
> themselves were invoked with -- i.e. only to decorators BELOW their own
> position, never back through decorators above them. Recommended ordering
> already places ``code-mode``/``defer`` first/outermost (see
> ``decorators/__init__.py``'s module docstring) specifically so their
> synthesized calls still pass through everything below -- but that only
> protects ``input_gate`` if ``input_gate`` is ALSO below them, not above.
> Likewise, ``storage`` may rehydrate a ``$stream`` argument handle into its
> real value on the way to upstream; an ``input_gate`` placed OUTER (earlier)
> than ``storage`` would evaluate ``deny_when`` against the un-rehydrated
> handle instead of the real value it references, silently missing a match.
> And ``rename`` rewrites the client-visible tool name back to the real
> upstream name on the way down -- an ``input_gate`` placed OUTER than
> ``rename`` would see the RENAMED name (e.g. a caller-facing
> ``partner__update_incident``) rather than the real upstream name its
> ``match_tools`` glob names (``update_incident``), so the gate would silently
> never trigger for a renamed tool. Placing ``input_gate`` last -- after
> ``code-mode``/``defer``/``storage``/``rename`` -- guarantees it always
> evaluates the fully-resolved arguments AND the real tool name the upstream
> is actually about to receive, regardless of what synthesized, rehydrated, or
> renamed the call on the way down.
