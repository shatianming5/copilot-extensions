"""RFC 8305-lite dual-stack connect racing for the HTTP MCP bridge transport.

``urllib``/``http.client`` (via ``socket.create_connection``) tries each
``getaddrinfo`` candidate **strictly in order**, waiting the *full* connect
timeout on one address family before ever trying the next. When a host's
route for one family is black-holed -- a dropped SYN, not a refused
connection -- that means every single request eats the whole timeout before
falling back, if it falls back within the timeout at all. Confirmed live
(the downstream tracker): a stale WSL2-mirrored IPv6 lease left ``eth0``'s global
addresses "deprecated preferred_lft 0sec" but still present, so DNS kept
returning an unreachable AAAA record and every ``agent-mcp`` HTTP-bridge call
hung for the full ~30s ``cfg.timeout`` before failing, stalling three
Intelligence Dampener PR reviews for 45+ minutes each until the interface was
cycled by hand. ``curl`` and browsers avoid exactly this with Happy Eyeballs
(RFC 8305): race the address families with a short head start for whichever
the resolver ranks first, and take whichever connects first.

This is a *lite* implementation scoped to what a single-endpoint MCP bridge
actually needs: one attempt per **distinct address family** (never per
address -- a bridge target is one endpoint, not a CDN with dozens of DNS
records), raced with threads rather than an event loop. The HTTP transport
already calls ``_post`` off the event loop via ``asyncio.to_thread``, so a
thread-based race costs nothing extra there.
