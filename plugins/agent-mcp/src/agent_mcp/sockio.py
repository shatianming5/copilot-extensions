"""Synchronous serve-socket client -- the asyncio-free half for the forwarder.

The thin per-session ``forward`` child (the #744 multiplexer client) must be as
small as possible: it is spawned once per MCP session, so every megabyte it
imports is paid N times over on a busy host. ``asyncio`` alone costs ~7 MiB of
RSS, so the forwarder does **not** use it. This module provides everything the
forwarder needs -- serve-host discovery, the attach handshake, and the
bidirectional byte pump -- using only ``socket`` + threads from the standard
library.

Transport is detected by **artifact**, not a platform probe: a resident host
publishes either an AF_UNIX socket file (POSIX) or a ``<socket>.endpoint``
sidecar carrying a loopback port + token (Windows). The client dials whichever
is present, so it always matches what the host actually bound without importing
``asyncio`` to ask. The async client + the server live in :mod:`agent_mcp.ipc`
and :mod:`agent_mcp.serve`; this module is import-compatible with them on the
wire (the same ``attach`` op + line-delimited JSON-RPC).
