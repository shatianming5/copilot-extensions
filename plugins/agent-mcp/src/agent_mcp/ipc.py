"""Serve IPC transport -- the **async** client for ``call`` + the server side.

The serve-host discovery + sidecar helpers (``default_socket_path``,
``serve_socket_if_available``, endpoint parsing) live in the stdlib-only
:mod:`agent_mcp.sockio` and are re-exported here. This module adds the
**asyncio** client used by the one-shot ``call`` fast-path and shared with the
:mod:`agent_mcp.serve` host: the ``request_via_socket`` / ``call_via_socket`` op
helpers and the ``open_attached_session`` attach.

The thin per-session **forwarder** (:mod:`agent_mcp.forward`) deliberately does
**not** import this module -- it uses :mod:`agent_mcp.sockio`'s synchronous
socket client instead, so it never pulls in ``asyncio`` (~7 MiB of RSS paid once
per MCP session). Both ends speak the same wire protocol -- the ``attach`` op and
line-delimited JSON-RPC -- so an async and a sync client interoperate with one
host.

The async client selects its transport with the :data:`_HAS_AF_UNIX` probe (an
AF_UNIX socket on POSIX, a loopback-TCP listener + token sidecar where asyncio
has no AF_UNIX); the sync forwarder detects the transport by artifact instead.
