"""Resident warmth tier: a local daemon holding warm upstream MCP sessions.

``agent-mcp call`` and the materialized stubs pay a per-call upstream cold-start
(spawn ``npx``/``bunx``/``node`` + the MCP ``initialize`` handshake) on *every*
invocation. ``agent-mcp serve`` keeps one warm :class:`OneShotSession` per bridge
and answers ``call``/``list`` requests over a local IPC socket, so repeated
calls skip the cold-start entirely.

The IPC transport is chosen per platform. On POSIX the daemon binds an
**AF_UNIX** socket at the configured path, gated by ordinary filesystem
permissions. Windows' asyncio event loops don't implement AF_UNIX, so there the
daemon binds a **loopback TCP** listener (``127.0.0.1:0``) and publishes the
chosen port plus a per-daemon auth **token** in an ``<socket>.endpoint`` sidecar
file (port-discovery); the client reads that file to dial the port and presents
the token on every request, reproducing the single-user gating the unix socket's
file permissions provide. Both ends derive the transport from the same
:data:`_HAS_AF_UNIX` probe, so they always agree.

The client (``agent-mcp call`` and thus every materialized stub, unchanged)
transparently falls back to the stateless one-shot path when the daemon is
absent, so ``serve`` is an **optional accelerator, never a dependency**.

The key observation is that :class:`OneShotSession` is already 90% of a warm
session -- it connects, runs ``initialize``, and can ``call_tool`` repeatedly; it
only tears down on ``__aexit__``. :class:`WarmPool` keeps a set of them open,
keyed by bridge config, reused across requests.

        at a dead daemon) and corrupt the orchestrator's own demote-to-
        ``previous`` bookkeeping (it would see the passive's own premature
        entry as "old" and demote *that*, not the real predecessor). (The

    Deliberately separate from the ``zdd`` control-plane routing table (which
    only the cutover orchestrator and control ops consult): every existing data
    client -- :func:`serve_socket_if_available`, the forwarder's ``attach``, one-
    shot ``call``/``materialize`` -- already re-resolves the *fixed* handle fresh
    on every invocation and needs **zero code changes** to follow a cutover,
    because that fixed handle is what this function repoints:

    * **POSIX** -- the fixed handle is a **symlink** to the real, generation-
      suffixed socket file. Repointing is ``os.symlink`` to a temp name +
      ``os.replace`` (atomic rename), so a reader never observes a missing or
      half-written link. Upgrades the very first cutover's fixed path in place
      even when it is still a plain (pre-cutover) socket file, not yet a link.
    * **Windows** -- the fixed handle has no real socket at all, only its
      ``<fixed>.endpoint`` sidecar (port + token). Repointing copies the new
      generation's own ``<new_data_socket_path>.endpoint`` content over the
      fixed sidecar, atomically (temp file + ``os.replace``).

    Called by the ``cutover`` CLI after ``CutoverOrchestrator`` commits -- never
    by the daemon itself (a promoted daemon does not know or care that it was
    promoted; it just keeps answering requests on the socket it already bound).
