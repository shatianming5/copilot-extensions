"""Zero-downtime cutover for ``agent-mcp serve`` (docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-
cutover.md, ``libs/zdd``).

The problem this closes: ``agent-mcp materialize``/``call`` and the multiplexed
``bridge``/``forward`` attach path all resolve the resident ``serve`` daemon
through a *fixed*, client-facing handle (an AF_UNIX socket path on POSIX, a
``<handle>.endpoint`` sidecar on Windows -- see :mod:`agent_mcp.sockio` /
:mod:`agent_mcp.ipc`). Before this module, replacing that daemon with a new
version meant stopping the old one and starting the new one -- a window,
however brief, where the fixed handle resolves to nothing and every call/attach
in that window has no live instance to reach. This module makes replacing the
daemon a **cutover** instead: stand the new version up *beside* the old one,
health-gate it, flip the fixed handle to it, drain the old one (refuse new
``attach`` sessions; already-attached ones and in-flight ``call``/``list``
requests are unaffected), then retire it -- so the fixed handle always
resolves to a live daemon.

Two separate planes, deliberately:

* **Data plane** -- the daemon's existing AF_UNIX/TCP transport, unchanged.
  Real MCP traffic never touches this module's code.
* **Control plane** -- a small, always-on, loopback-TCP-only listener every
  ``serve`` daemon (passive or promoted) binds purely for lifecycle signaling
  (``ping``/``drain``/``undrain``/``shutdown``), published to the shared
  ``zdd`` routing table (``libs/zdd``) so this orchestrator can find *any*
  running generation, including one it did not spawn.

Scope note (v1): this drives the cutover state machine and the one-shot/
attach-session drain semantics. It does **not** yet include the "generation
self-retire" watchdog backstop `docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-cutover.md`
describes as an optional hardening even for its reference implementation, nor
automatic installer-triggered cutover on every version bump -- both are
explicitly named follow-up phases (see the ``agent-mcp-graceful-cutover``
effort). A daemon that predates this module has no control channel to dial;
that one-time bootstrap transition is a plain stop/start, not a regression.
