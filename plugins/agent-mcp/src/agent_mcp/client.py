"""One-shot upstream MCP client: connect, initialize, list/call, exit.

The bridge (:mod:`agent_mcp.bridge`) keeps a long-lived stdio session that
proxies a *client's* JSON-RPC traffic to one upstream. The **materialize** and
**call** verbs need the opposite shape: drive the upstream *ourselves* for a
single, stateless interaction -- fetch the tool catalog, or invoke one tool --
then tear down.

:class:`OneShotSession` reuses the same transport + auth-injector stack as the
bridge (so http/sse/stdio and credential injection all behave identically), adds
the MCP ``initialize`` handshake the bridge normally relays from its client, and
exposes two calls: :meth:`list_tools` and :meth:`call_tool`. It is the execution
substrate under ``agent-mcp call`` and the introspection step of
``agent-mcp materialize``.

There is deliberately **no per-call daemon** here: a one-shot connect avoids the
per-session ``uv run``/``npx`` cold-start that a resident MCP server pays, while
still being a live stdio/http session (a future ``agent-mcp serve`` can hold the
connection warm; the stubs fall back to this path when it is absent).
