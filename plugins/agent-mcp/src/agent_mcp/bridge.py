"""Bridge core: a local stdio MCP server that proxies to one upstream.

Reads line-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin and runs each client message through a
:class:`~agent_mcp.pipeline.Pipeline` of decorators wrapping the upstream
transport. Decorators may filter, rename, defer, code-mode, or storage-relay the
traffic (see :mod:`agent_mcp.decorators`); the legacy top-level ``tools:`` filter
is applied as an implicit decorator. Transport and auth specifics live in
:mod:`agent_mcp.transports` and :mod:`agent_mcp.auth`.
