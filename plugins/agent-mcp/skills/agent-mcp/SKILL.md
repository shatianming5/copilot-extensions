`agent-mcp` wraps one upstream MCP server as a local **stdio** MCP server and
injects host credentials, driven by a single per-bridge config file. It is
standalone: a sub-agent launches `agent-mcp` directly from its `mcp-servers`
entry; there is no agent-bridge integration, repo resolver, or required daemon.
It replaces single-purpose, hardcoded MCP wrapper scripts with a config-driven,
multi-transport, multi-auth bridge.

## Responsibility boundary

This skill owns bridge transport, authentication, filtering, catalog
reshaping, materialization, and bridge-equivalent fallback. The normative
custom-agent contract -- whether a domain MCP belongs in a sub-agent, bounded
execution, top-level tools, `## MCP Readiness`, and anti-self-delegation -- is
owned by **`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`**. Runtime task decomposition
is owned by **`delegation-guidance:delegating-work`**.

## When to use

- An MCP server requires an OAuth/broker login flow (Entra/`az`, `gh`) that
  Copilot CLI can't perform itself.
- You want to wrap a third-party stdio MCP and feed it a host-acquired token.
- You want to allow/deny which upstream tools are exposed.
- You want to **reshape a large or partner MCP**: shrink a 100+ tool catalog
  behind a tool-finder, namespace/rename tools, expose a typed `run_code` tool,
  or relay big payloads through a stream buffer — see [Decorator stack](#decorator-stack).
- You want to wire an existing repo-scoped agent (e.g. `@ado-data`) to MCP
  tools from an authenticated upstream -- see the setup flow below.

## Config location -- in-repo vs. user-global

A bridge config can be referenced two ways:

| Form | Reference | Lives in | Use for |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **In-repo `--config`** (preferred) | `bridge --config <path>` | the repo (e.g. `.github/agents/<name>.mcp.yaml`) | **repo-scoped agents** -- config is version-controlled, travels with the repo, needs no deploy |
| **Named bridge** | `bridge <name>` | `~/.agent-mcp/bridges/<name>.{yaml,yml,json}` | **personal / cross-repo** MCPs not tied to one repo <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics --> |
| **Plugin-shipped bridge** | `bridge <name>` | installed plugin `agents/` or `mcp/` directory | a plugin ships its own sub-agent + bridge config; user-space bridge file is not required |

> **Prefer the in-repo `--config` form for any agent that ships inside a repo.**
> Reserve named bridges (user-global `~/.agent-mcp/bridges/`) for MCPs you use <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->
> across many repos or that do not belong to a checkout. Both forms read the
> same config schema; only the lookup differs.

> **Customizing an existing bridge on one machine** — to change a committed or
> plugin-shipped bridge (which tools it exposes, its decorators, headers, auth)
> for *this host only*, without editing the shared file, use the
> **`customizing-bridges`** skill: it writes a deep-merged overlay at
> `~/.agent-mcp/overrides/<id>.yaml`. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->

## Wire an existing repo-scoped agent (the common case)

First author the agent with
**`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`**. This section covers only the
bridge-specific transport and fallback wiring for giving that agent
authenticated MCP tools -- e.g. an `@ado-data` agent backed by the Azure DevOps
MCP.

**1. Write the bridge config in the repo**, next to the agent
(`.github/agents/<name>.mcp.yaml`). It holds the upstream `server` launch info
(same shape as a `.mcp.json` entry) plus `auth` and overrides. Copy the full
annotated example, [`references/ado.mcp.yaml`](references/ado.mcp.yaml), and
adapt -- at a glance:

```yaml
# .github/agents/ado.mcp.yaml
server:
  type: http                       # http | stdio | cli
  url: https://mcp.dev.azure.com/your-org
  protocol: auto                   # auto | modern | legacy | <YYYY-MM-DD>  (MCP 2.x, see below)
auth:
  kind: entra                      # entra|az | gh | git-credential | env|static | none
  resource: 2a72489c-aab2-4b65-b93a-a91edccf33b8   # az resource/scope
tools: { allow: ["repo_*", "wit_*"], deny: [] }    # optional upstream filter
```

Validate before wiring:
`<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> validate .github/agents/ado.mcp.yaml`.

> **MCP 2.x (dual-era).** agent-mcp speaks both the **modern** stateless
> revision (`2026-07-28`+ — per-request `_meta`, no `initialize`/session,
> optional `server/discover`) and the **legacy** `initialize` handshake, in both
> directions: it negotiates an upstream's era when consuming one, and exposes a
> `cli` adapter as a dual-era server (answers `server/discover`, cacheable
> `tools/list`). `server.protocol` defaults to `auto` (probe + fall back to
> legacy); set `modern`/`legacy`/an explicit `YYYY-MM-DD` to force or pin an era.
> See the plugin README (§ *Protocol versions (MCP 2.x / dual-era)*).

> **stdio launch — `command` vs `npm`.** A stdio bridge either lists an explicit
> `server.command` (full control) or names an npm package with `server.npm:
> <pkg>` and lets agent-mcp pick the fastest **available** runner at spawn
> (`bunx` → `npx -y`). `npm` mode stays package-manager-neutral (always works via
> `npx`; uses `bunx` only where present). See the plugin README for details.

**2. Point the existing agent at it** in the `mcp-servers` field that
`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents` owns. The transport stanza is
`agent-mcp` running the bridge over stdio:

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  ado-remote-mcp:
    type: stdio
    command: agent-mcp              # marketplace-isolation: allow mcp-server-startup
    args: ['bridge', '--config', '.github/agents/ado.mcp.yaml']
    tools: ['*']
```

The `--config` path is resolved relative to the process cwd, which is the repo
root when Copilot spawns the sub-agent's MCP server -- so an in-repo relative
path just works.

The literal `mcp-servers.command` is an explicit startup compatibility
boundary. Repository-committed agent frontmatter must stay machine-portable,
has no plugin-root interpolation contract, and may be launched before or
independently of session command-catalog context. It therefore cannot consume
`<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]>`. Keep it literal until the host offers a
plugin-root-capable MCP launcher contract.

**3. Verify end-to-end** by invoking the sub-agent and having it call an upstream
tool (e.g. fetch a repo). A clean way to prove the bridge -- not a stale runtime
-- is in use is to exercise a real query and confirm a live result.

**4. Add the equivalent CLI fallback mechanics.** In the readiness section
owned by `customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`, name a materialized fleet
over the same bridge config, probe a read-only stub after catalog failure,
preserve identity and top-level `tools:` filtering, and stop only after both
surfaces fail. Decorator-only restrictions are not applied by the CLI path, and
frontmatter-only env is not inherited. Use an existing fleet first;
re-materialize when the expected stub is absent or
`manifest.json.generated_by` differs from
`<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> --version` (config drift needs a deploy-owned
digest). Use `--no-serve` for identity-sensitive fallback calls. The
bridge-specific platform commands, failure matrix, warmth guidance, and
drift contract live in
[Reliable agent-mcp transport and fallback](references/reliable-agent.md).

> **`command: agent-mcp` is cross-platform.** The Windows binstub is a single
> `.cmd` (no competing `.ps1`), so a bare `agent-mcp` resolves to it under
> PowerShell, `where`/PATHEXT, and `cmd`, and the `.cmd` forwards stdin to the
> stdio MCP child. Use plain `command: agent-mcp` on every platform -- no `.cmd`
> suffix needed.

## Auth kinds

| kind | acquires via | injects |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `entra` / `az` | on-PATH `ado-auth-helper` (Codespace-guest relay client) if present, else `az account get-access-token`; always the latter when `tenant` is configured, since the relay has no tenant parameter | `Authorization: Bearer` (http) / env (stdio) |
| `gh` | `gh auth token` | `Authorization: Bearer` / env |
| `git-credential` | Git Credential Manager | `Authorization: Basic` / env |
| `command` | any `git credential fill`-shaped command | templated header / env |
| `env` / `static` | host env var or literal | templated header / target env |
| `none` | -- | nothing |

Token acquisition reuses the `credential-relay` sources. HTTP bridges invalidate
the cached credential and retry once on an upstream `401`; stdio/cli bridges
inject env at child spawn and rely on the child tool/server error if a required
secret is missing.

The `command` kind runs **any** external command that speaks the git-credential
protocol — `auth.request` fields are fed on stdin, and stdout supplies the
secret. Two parse modes:

- `parse: raw` (stdout is the secret verbatim) wraps a plain printer such as
  `vault get "<entry>" password` with no adapter.
- `parse: keyvalue` (default; extract `auth.field`, default `token`/`password`)
  wraps `git credential fill`, a vault `git-credential` helper, or a password
  manager CLI.

This is the path for vault-backed secrets: the token is fetched on demand and
injected only into the wrapped child, instead of being exported into the whole
session environment.

**Multiple secrets:** set `auth` to a **list** of auth blocks to inject several
secrets into one child (e.g. a controller password *and* an API key). Each entry
is a normal auth block and must set a distinct `target_env`; the bridge merges
them into the child environment.

```yaml
auth:
  - kind: command
    command: ["vault", "get", "My Vault/UniFi Controller", "password"]
    parse: raw
    target_env: UNIFI_NETWORK_PASSWORD
  - kind: command
    command: ["vault", "get", "My Vault/UniFi API Key (Local)", "password"]
    parse: raw
    target_env: UNIFI_API_KEY
```

## Secret in the URL (`server.url_secrets`)

Some upstreams carry the secret **in the URL itself** rather than a header — e.g.
an add-on that gates access on a secret URL path (`/private_<token>`). For those,
a `${name}` placeholder in `server.url` is resolved at **spawn time** from a
matching `server.url_secrets` source. Each source is an ordinary auth block
(same kinds as above — typically `command` + `parse: raw`), so the secret is
fetched on demand and never committed or exported into the session env. This
lets a committed config carry a secret URL **by reference** instead of forcing a
machine-local override to hardcode the full secret URL.

```yaml
server:
  type: http
  # Whole URL from one secret (the vault entry stores the full URL):
  url: "${ha_url}"
  url_secrets:
    ha_url:
      kind: command
      parse: raw
      command: ["vault", "get", "My Vault/HA MCP Add-on", "password"]
```

You can also interpolate just **part** of the path (store only the token in the
vault):

```yaml
server:
  type: http
  url: "http://homeassistant.example:9583/${ha_path}"
  url_secrets:
    ha_path:
      kind: command
      parse: raw
      command: ["vault", "get", "My Vault/HA MCP Add-on", "secret-path"]
```

Rules:

- Only valid for `type: http`. Every `${name}` in the URL must have a matching
  `url_secrets` source, and vice versa — a mismatch is a load-time config error.
- Resolution is **lazy** (first connect), so the payload-local command's
  `validate` / `status` operations never touch the credential source. If the
  source can't be resolved at connect (e.g. the vault is locked), the bridge
  fails loudly rather than connecting to a half-formed URL.
- Prefer this over a machine-local override whenever the secret is the *only*
  per-host difference — the committed config then works on every host with no
  override file.

## Decorator stack

Beyond transport + auth, a bridge can apply an ordered **decorator stack** — MCP
middleware that rewrites the JSON-RPC traffic in both directions. Add a
`decorators:` list to the bridge config (entries are listed **client → upstream**,
outermost first):

```yaml
server: { type: http, url: https://mcp.example.com }
auth:   { kind: entra, resource: <guid> }
decorators:
  - type: defer            # hide a 100+ tool catalog behind find_tool/execute_tool
    mode: lazy             #   lazy (default) | eager | meta_only
    expose: ["search_*"]
  - type: rename           # namespace/prefix/suffix/regex on names + descriptions
    namespace: partner
  - type: filter           # allow/deny tools (also rejects hidden tools/call)
    deny: ["*_delete", "*_admin"]
  - type: code-mode        # one typed run_code tool (TS interface) instead of N defs
    tool: run_code
  - type: storage          # relay large tool I/O through a file/http stream buffer
    backend: file
    threshold: 8192
```

| Decorator | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| `filter` | Prune `tools/list` and reject calls to hidden tools (`allow`/`deny` globs). |
| `rename` | Rewrite tool names/descriptions (`namespace`/`prefix`/`suffix`/regex `patterns`); routes calls back to real names. |
| `defer` | Expose `find_tool`/`execute_tool` (+`load_tools` in lazy mode) over a large catalog. The UniFi MCP pattern. |
| `code-mode` | Expose a `run_code` tool with a generated TypeScript `Tools` interface; snippets run in Node and chain tool calls. Adds `find_tool` for typed signatures on big catalogs. Needs Node on `PATH`. **Best only when calls chain, payloads are large, *and* output shapes are documented — see [prerequisites](#is-an-mcp-a-good-code-mode-candidate-prerequisites); pair with `transform` when they aren't.** |
| `storage` | Externalize large outputs to `mcpstream://…` handles; rehydrate handle inputs; `read_stream` fetches them. **Field-level `rules:`** target specific tool input/output JSON paths, attach a summary (count + schema + head, or a command), and rewrite a stream-mode input param's schema to a URL. |
| `transform` | Reshape tool results per tool: `extract`/`pick`/`drop` dotted paths (literal-dotted keys like ADO `fields.System.Title` supported) or a `command` (jq-style) filter. |
| `gate` | Allow/deny a tool **per-call** by a **preflight** upstream lookup + boolean predicate (`all`/`any`/`not`; `in`/`matches`/`equals`/`contains`/`exists` over `[*]`/dotted paths). Deny → `stub`/`drop`/`error`; fail-closed on preflight error. For rules whose signal is out-of-band for the gated tool. |
| `input_gate` | Deny a tool call whose **own arguments** match a `deny_when` predicate (same predicate language as `gate`'s `allow_when`, evaluated directly against the call — no preflight). For "never let this write introduce marker X" invariants a preflight can't see. Must be positioned **last** (innermost) — after `code-mode`/`defer`/`storage`/`rename` — or config validation rejects it; see the README's `input_gate` section for why. |

Decorators compose because each calls *through* the ones below it. Recommended
order: `defer`/`code-mode` outermost, then `rename`, then `filter`, then `gate`,
with `storage` innermost — **except `input_gate`, which must go even after
`storage` and `rename`** (truly last of all; config validation enforces this). The legacy
`tools:` filter still works (applied as an implicit `filter`). Full reference +
per-decorator options: [README → Decorator stack](../../README.md#decorator-stack).

### Is an MCP a good `code-mode` candidate? (prerequisites)

`code-mode` is not a free win — reach for it only when **all four** hold:

1. **Chained calls** — one tool's output feeds the next (resolve → fetch →
   filter). One-shot tools (a single search with server-side filtering) gain
   nothing.
2. **Large intermediate payloads** — better filtered inside the snippet than
   dumped into context.
3. **A catalog big enough** that typed discovery (`find_tool`) earns its keep
   (roughly `interface_limit`, 40+).
4. **Predictable, documented output shapes.** ← the easy one to miss.

Criterion **4** is the gate. The generated `Tools` interface types **inputs
only** (from each tool's `inputSchema`); every method returns **`Promise<any>`**
— MCP tools rarely ship an `outputSchema`, and the renderer ignores it if they
do. So in a snippet the model must commit to a result shape *before it runs*,
with no types to lean on. Direct tool calls sidestep this (the model sees each
result and adapts turn-by-turn); `code-mode` cannot. Result-shape surprises also
vary *per tool*: a **lone** JSON text result is auto-parsed to an object, but a
**multi-item** content result arrives as the raw MCP content array
(`[{type:"text", text:"…"}]`) that the snippet must unwrap and `JSON.parse`
itself. With undocumented shapes, every snippet becomes a guess (or burns a probe
round), erasing the round-trip savings.

**Fix — pair `code-mode` with `transform`.** When outputs are undocumented or
messy, add a `transform` decorator **innermost** (upstream end) that
`pick`/`extract`/`drop`s each read tool's result into a small, **stable, named**
schema — then document that schema in the sub-agent's `.agent.md`. Now snippets
are written against a known shape, payloads shrink (helps 2), and `code-mode`
delivers. Without a `transform` companion for undocumented upstreams, prefer
**direct tool calls** (a plain `tools:` allow/deny filter) — they are the more
reliable default.

## Commands

```
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> bridge --config FILE    # run an in-repo bridge
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> bridge <name>           # run a named bridge
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> validate <name|FILE>    # parse + schema-check
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> status                  # prerequisites + bridges
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> call <bridge> <tool> [JSON]
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> materialize <bridge>
<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> serve [--socket PATH]
```

## Troubleshooting checklist

- Start with `<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> validate <name-or-config>`; it loads
  the same in-repo, named, plugin-shipped, and machine-overlay config path as
  `bridge`/`call`, but does not contact the upstream or credential source.
- Reproduce outside Copilot with
  `<agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> --log-level debug call <bridge> <tool>
  '<arguments-json>'`. A `server/discover` rejection in `auto` is normal for a
  legacy server; set `server.protocol: legacy` to skip that probe.
- Separate runtime provisioning from bridge config: catalog `availability`
  reports whether the payload shim and installer exist, not whether the runtime
  is already built. If invocation prints `::agent-provisioning::`, let first-use
  provisioning finish and preserve the exact failure. If the catalog entry is
  absent, follow the readiness path above.
- Credential failures differ by transport: `server.url_secrets` fail before HTTP
  connect; `command` auth logs command-not-found/timeout/non-zero exit; HTTP gets
  a 401/error path with one retry, while stdio/cli children must report missing
  env/credential themselves.

## MCP -> CLI: `call` and `materialize`

Besides serving an MCP client, agent-mcp can expose an upstream MCP **to the
shell** -- for agents (or humans) that prefer to `ls`/`cat`/pipe tools instead
of speaking JSON-RPC.

- **`call`** is the one-shot engine: it connects to the bridge's upstream,
  negotiates the configured protocol era (`server/discover` in modern/auto, or
  legacy `initialize`), invokes one tool, and prints the result. Arguments are
  the tool's **raw MCP `arguments` object** as JSON -- via an inline arg, `--arguments`,
  `--request-file PATH`, or stdin. Output is **raw passthrough** (the upstream's
  text content verbatim; the advertised `structuredContent` as JSON when there is
  no text). A tool error is a non-zero exit + a stderr message -- never a hang
  (the wait is bounded by the config `timeout`).

  ```sh
  # POSIX. On Windows, put structured arguments in a request file.
  <agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> call gitea list_issues '{"owner":"me","repo":"x"}'
  echo '{"owner":"me","repo":"x"}' | <agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> call gitea list_issues
  <agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> call gitea create_issue --request-file req.json
  ```

  The Windows catalog intentionally names the payload `.cmd` so stdio reaches
  the child through a native process. Do not pass inline JSON through CMD;
  provide it on stdin or with `--request-file` at a simple temporary path.

- **`materialize`** projects the whole `tools/list` catalog into a discoverable,
  pipeable command fleet under `~/.agent-mcp/materialized/<server>/`: <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow deployed-runtime-diagnostics -->

  ```
  bin/    one short-named stub per tool (POSIX: symlinks to one dispatcher;
          Windows: a .ps1 + .cmd shim per tool). Put bin/ on PATH.
  doc/    a plated sidecar per tool: the upstream description + raw inputSchema.
  index.md, manifest.json
  ```

  Generation is **purely mechanical** -- sidecars plate the raw MCP definition,
  stubs accept the raw `arguments` JSON (no `--flag` synthesis), and nothing is
  guessed by a model. Each stub intentionally forwards through the legacy
  global management wrapper because a generated fleet can outlive the session
  catalog. <!-- marketplace-isolation: allow materialized-stub-management -->
  The stub is therefore an explicit compatibility boundary, not a
  payload-local invocation claim. Until materialized fleets gain attributable
  management context, ambient `PATH` can still select a different installation
  cell; do not treat this fallback as cross-cell-safe.

  ```sh
  <agent-mcp catalog argv[0]> materialize gitea
  list_issues '{"owner":"me","repo":"x"}' | jq '.[].number'
  ```

  Re-running `materialize` rebuilds the tree atomically (temp dir + swap), so it
  doubles as a drift refresh. The bridge's `tools:` allow/deny filter gates which
  tools are materialized.

For sub-agent reliability, this fleet is the **same-bridge fallback** after a
Copilot catalog/registration failure -- not a raw bypass. Authorization must be
captured by bridge auth + top-level `tools:`; decorator stacks are not applied
on the one-shot CLI path. Preserve the primary error, verify identity/capability
through a read-only stub, and report both errors if the upstream also fails.
See
[Reliable agent-mcp transport and fallback](references/reliable-agent.md).

## CLI -> MCP: the `cli` server type

The inverse crossing: expose **native CLIs as MCP tools** for an MCP-only
consumer, with no upstream MCP and no per-tool server. `server.type: cli` lists
tool **sidecars** (`.md` files with an `mcp:` frontmatter block carrying
`name`/`description`/`inputSchema` plus an `invoke` argv template); `tools/list`
is synthesized from them and `tools/call` binds params to an **argv** and spawns
the CLI (no shell). A sidecar's optional `mcp.scope` tag, matched against
`server.scopes`, gates which tools a host may advertise/run. See the plugin
README (§ *CLI -> MCP: the `cli` server type*) for the sidecar schema, argv-binding
rules, and scope gating.

```yaml
server:
  type: cli
  tools_from: [tools/vei-search.md, tools/vei-status.md]
  scopes: [shared, anomalous-potato]
tools: { allow: ["vei_*"] }
```

## Install

`./scripts/init.sh` (Linux/WSL) or `.\scripts\init.ps1` (Windows) -- creates the
venv at `~/.agent-mcp` and the `agent-mcp` binstub (a single `.cmd` on Windows)
in `~/.local/bin`.
