"""Tests for the stale-version reaper (scripts/reap_versions.py).

Covers the pure slot-attribution helper, the reap policy (only NON-current
slots, never self/current), and a real process-tree terminate. The process
*enumeration* is monkeypatched so the policy can be exercised deterministically
without standing up real per-version venvs; `_terminate_tree` is exercised
against a genuinely spawned child.

`reap_versions` imports the (unmodified) shared primitive's attribution helpers
by name, so those names live on the `reap_versions` module and are patched there.
