"""Tests for the versioned self-install (Phase 2/3 — same convention as the core).

Asserts the shared versioning artifacts: a plain-text ``current-version`` marker,
an immutable ``versions/<ver>/`` slot, and a ``~/.local/bin`` binstub — plus
idempotent, version-gated behavior. No real venv is built (uv is not invoked);
the fast materialize+marker+binstub path is exercised against a synthetic payload
and a synthetic HOME/root.
