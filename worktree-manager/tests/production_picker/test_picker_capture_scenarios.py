"""Golden-screenshot baseline for representative Worktrees-pivot states
(``worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul`` effort, Phase 1).

Sibling to ``test_picker_capture.py``'s own golden coverage (a 2-row WIP/
UNUSED fleet) -- this file adds the specific representative states that
effort's Phase 1 plan calls for: empty, ACTIVE-only, a broader mixed
ACTIVE+Recent+various-state fleet, a claims-bearing (open PR) worktree, and a
long-running-but-recently-used worktree (the exact shape Phase 3's
recency-sort fix targets -- an old ``started_at`` next to live/recent
activity, captured here as the documented "before" state).

Same deterministic-renderer contract as the sibling file: a known fixture
fleet yields a known character grid, regenerate-able with
``AGENT_WORKTREES_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1``. Each golden is intentionally
self-contained (own fixture, own file) so a later phase's rendering change
shows a clean, reviewable diff scoped to the state it actually affects.
