# session-options.sh -- per-session tmux options for agent-worktrees panes.
#
# agent-worktrees does NOT own your global ~/.tmux.conf. Instead the launcher
# stamps these options onto each session it creates, scoped to that one session
# (`tmux set -t <session>`, no -g), so your personal tmux config and any ad-hoc
# tmux sessions sharing the same server are left untouched.
#
# Settings that CANNOT be session-scoped -- the server-global `escape-time` and
# the keystroke-passthrough root key table -- are NOT applied here. They live in
# the optional, opt-in apply-mux-keybinds.sh; run it once per machine (or wire
# it into a machine-restore flow) if you want them.
#
# This file is sourced, not executed. It defines one function.

# aw_apply_tmux_session_options <session-name> [worktree-id]
#
# Apply the worktree status bar + session behaviors to a single tmux session.
# Idempotent and side-effect-free on global state -- only ever touches the named
# session (and its active window). Safe to call after every new-session.
# (A second positional arg is accepted for call-site compatibility but unused:
# the status-updater watcher classifies the worktree by path.)
#
# Note (tmux 3.4): the `=name` exact-match target form does NOT resolve for
# `set`/`show` (it works for has-session/switch-client). Session ids here are
# unique timestamped slugs, so the plain prefix-matching name is unambiguous.

    # -- Status bar -------------------------------------------------------
    # Left: worktree identity (machine | env | repo:id4), static per session.
    # Right: worktree git disposition block + clock.
    #
    # CRITICAL: the status bar must NOT invoke the (heavy, Python) agent-worktrees
    # CLI on its render path. tmux runs `#()` jobs async + cached, but psmux
    # repaints synchronously -- a Python cold-start per frame makes the terminal
    # crawl. Instead the bar reads precomputed session options that the common
    # `status-updater` watcher refreshes OFF the render path (#{@aw_ctx} once,
    # #{@aw_seg} each tick, via `set-option`). Between updates the bar does zero
    # process work -- only the %H:%M clock. Unset (non-worktree) sessions render
    # a blank bar. The writer is spawned by the launcher.
