"""Worktree Manager mux-mapping registry (Phase 3b Slice 2 Sub-slice 3 Step 2
-- ``worktree-manager-control-plane`` effort).

Split out of ``mux_daemon.py`` (which now owns the daemon lifecycle/wire
server) purely to stay under this repo's per-module line cap -- see that
module's own docstring for the full Step 2 rationale and the process-
boundary rule this package follows (Worktree Manager never imports
``agent_worktrees`` in-process).

The mapping registry (:class:`MuxMappingRegistry`) is deliberately **not**
owned in-memory by one long-lived daemon process the way
``agent_worktrees.mux_link.ManagedMuxCache`` owns its cache: register/remove
calls come from short-lived CLI invocations (eventually the launch scripts
themselves), not from a process that stays alive for the mapping's whole
lifetime. The registry is therefore always disk-backed, with the same
cross-process advisory lock + read-reconcile-write pattern
``ManagedMuxCache.apply_observation`` uses, so any process (a register/remove
CLI call, or the resident daemon's own request handler) sees a consistent
view. "Recovery-on-restart" is therefore automatic: there is no separate
warm-load step because there is no separate in-memory state to warm.

        register revision 5, remove at revision 6, then a delayed register
        at revision 5 arrives: with the entry gone, ``register()`` would
        see no current entry and accept the stale mapping, resurrecting it.
        Persisting a tombstone at the removal's own revision keeps the
        guard intact. If ``mapping_revision`` is given, a stored entry at a
        *newer* revision is left in place rather than tombstoned (an
        out-of-order remove arriving after a newer register must not
        clobber it).

        Two further fencing cases (Copilot review findings):

        * A *revisioned* remove for a key with no current entry still
          persists a durable tombstone at that revision -- otherwise a
          remove(6) racing ahead of (or following snapshot loss of) an
          eventual register(5) would leave nothing behind to reject that
          now-stale register against.
        * An *unversioned* remove (``mapping_revision=None``, the CLI's own
          default) bumps the tombstone's revision one past the current
          entry's, rather than keeping it unchanged -- ``register()``'s own
          guard only rejects a revision strictly *less than* current, so a
          delayed ``live: true`` update at the SAME (unbumped) revision
          would otherwise still be accepted, resurrecting the mapping this
          call just removed.

        ``mux_session``/``session_incarnation``, when given, guard against a
        *stale teardown race* (#3838): an old launcher's teardown for
        session A can race behind a newer launcher's activation for session
        B on the same ``(project, worktree_id)`` -- neither necessarily
        carries a revision the other knows to fence against. A mismatch
        against a *currently live* entry is treated as a stale no-op rather
        than tombstoned: unconditionally tombstoning whatever is currently
        mapped would silently kill B's live status updates even though B is
        the session that should still be live.

        ``mux_session`` (the display session name) is NOT unique per launch
        incarnation -- both launchers derive the same deterministic
        ``wt-<worktree_id>``-shaped name for the same worktree, so a session
        recreated for the same worktree reuses the exact string and an
        old/new pair compares equal by name alone (a Copilot review
        finding). ``session_incarnation`` (a per-launch-attempt token the
        launcher generates and threads through both its own register call
        and the paired teardown call) is therefore the authoritative check
        when both the caller and the current entry carry one; ``mux_session``
        is only a fallback for callers that don't (older callers, or a
        generic CLI invocation with no incarnation token available). Missing
        both (``mux_session=None`` and ``session_incarnation=None``)
        preserves the prior, fully unguarded behavior -- these parameters
        are additive and optional.
