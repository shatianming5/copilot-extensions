"""Preview mode: render the REAL production Picker against deterministic,
mock, no-live-engine-required data.

Two independent injections compose to make this work, both riding seams the
real architecture already exposes rather than adding any Picker-specific
mock branch:

1. **Worktree data** -- ``engine_client.set_engine_command`` (the same
   mechanism ``picker_app``'s older demo mode used) is pointed at
   ``demo_engine``, the existing fake-engine subprocess that emits the
   Example Labs fixture (``demo.py``) in the real ``list --json`` contract
   shape. Every consumer that shells out through ``engine_client`` --
   including ``production_picker``'s own ``data_local``/``data_ssh`` --
   transparently receives mock rows instead of running the real engine.
2. **A contributed pivot** -- the Picker's cross-plugin pivot registry
   (``picker_tui.pivot_manifest``/``pivot_registry_scan``) already lets any
   plugin contribute a pivot via a filesystem manifest, entirely decoupled
   from engine code (see that module's own docstring). This function
   materializes one plain, schema-less ("operator"-class, always active, no
   plugin/root attribution needed) manifest into an isolated temp directory
   naming ``demo_pivot``'s ``list`` command, and points
   ``AGENT_WORKTREES_PIVOTS_DIR`` at it -- with real-plugin materialization
   disabled, so the *only* pivot the registry scan finds is this one. This
   previews the generic multi-pivot rendering path (columns, claims-summary
   convention, etc.) the same way a real contributed pivot would, using
   synthetic data.

Because both injections are pure environment/subprocess-command overrides,
the actual ``production_picker`` app, screen, and rendering code run
completely unmodified -- a preview capture is the same code path a real
capture takes, just fed fixture data. Call :func:`enable_preview_mode` once,
before constructing/running/capturing the Picker; it is idempotent and
process-local (never touches another process's environment).
