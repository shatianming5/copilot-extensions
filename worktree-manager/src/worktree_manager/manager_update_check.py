"""Lightweight, cached check for a newer Worktree Manager release.

Distinct from ``agent_worktrees.update_stage`` (the launcher's marketplace
payload staging): that module's ``indicator_state()`` reflects whether the
**agent-worktrees engine plugin**'s marketplace payload changed, not whether
a newer **Worktree Manager** version exists. The picker's topbar shows the
Manager's own ``v{VERSION}`` string, so a checkmark sourced only from the
engine's staging state next to it read as "the Manager is current" when it
never checked that at all -- confirmed live: an operator running an old
Manager build saw a plain "✓" next to their stale version number. This
module answers the question the operator actually asked.

Read-only/cheap functions (:func:`read_status`, :func:`indicator_state`,
:func:`should_check`) are safe on the render tick. The actual network fetch
(:func:`check_now`) belongs on a background thread, and is itself gated by
:data:`CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS` so a picker relaunch doesn't hit GitHub on every
single launch -- the cached status file persists across runs.
