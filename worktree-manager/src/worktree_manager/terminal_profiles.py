"""Terminal-profile *selection* model -- the Picker's Profiles grid, persisted.

Each machine owns **one column** of the host x target matrix: the set of launch
targets that *this* machine's terminal app carries a profile for, for the active
repo. The selection is the source of truth (operator direction, effort
``worktree-picker-tty-overhaul``):

- **Adoption** seeds the column with only the locked **self.agent** diagonal
  ("this host launches itself as an agent").
- The **Picker** edits the column (and, over SSH, other machines' columns).
- ``<project> update`` / ``install --refresh-profiles`` **mirrors** the column
  to the real Windows Terminal fragment / Tabby profiles.

Storage: a top-level ``terminal_profiles`` list in the machine-local, per-repo
``~/.<project>/config.yaml`` (the config dir is already per-repo, so a top-level
key there is implicitly scoped to this repo + this machine):

    terminal_profiles:
      - {machine: owner_user-book2, env: Win, kind: agent}   # self (locked)
      - {machine: owner_user-dev6, env: WSL, kind: shell}

The ``machine`` field is the roster **key** (the canonical full name), not the
cosmetic ``display_name``.

This module only models + persists the *selection*. Mirroring it to terminal
apps is the installer's job: it captures the fragment JSON from the Python
generator (``agent_worktrees.terminal_fragment``) and writes it to the Windows
Terminal fragments dir.

This is a DIFFERENT system from ``config.copilot_profiles`` (the agent *backend*
cloud/local-model selection) -- the two must not be conflated.

Relocated verbatim from ``agent_worktrees.profiles`` (copilot-extensions#3390,
Phase 3e Step 1 of the ``worktree-manager-control-plane`` effort): terminal
handling of every kind is leaving agent-worktrees for this control-plane app,
in phases, matching the earlier Mux/AHP relocation (#2062). agent-worktrees
still carries its own copy and CLI verbs (``profiles``/``terminal-fragment``)
during the transition -- see the effort's Phase 3e doc for the ordered
cutover plan.
