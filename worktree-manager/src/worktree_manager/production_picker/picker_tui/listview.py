"""Generic filter + sort state for a picker list surface (Phase 4, #2228).

`ListView` is the client-side counterpart to `ListSelection` (`selection.py`):
a free-text filter plus a cyclable sort key, operating over the caller's own
already-fetched, already-normalized rows. No Textual/picker dependency, so it
is testable in isolation and reusable by any future list surface (the
Worktrees list first; registered pivots next, per the effort's own
sequencing) without reimplementing filter/sort per contributor.

Cross-effort record-shape contract (picker-list-interaction-layer README,
Phase 4): a filter must never silently drop a row a live-signals contract
depends on without an explicit affordance. `filter()`'s `keep` predicate is
that affordance -- a caller passes one that recognizes its own "always
show" rows (e.g. a live/bare-orphan worktree) so a query narrowing the view
can never make the row the operator is mid-session on simply vanish.
