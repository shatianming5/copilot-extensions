"""Worktree Picker TUI (Textual) -- the overhauled multi-machine picker.

Ported from the test-chamber ``worktree-picker-tty-overhaul`` prototype. The
``engine`` renders over any *source* exposing ``LOCAL`` / ``LOCAL_LABEL`` /
``machines()`` / ``load()`` / ``bucket`` / ``for_machine`` (and ``make_loader``
for live multi-machine). ``data_local`` is the real local source.

The Textual picker is the **only supported picker** -- there is no opt-out.
Its legacy ANSI predecessor is retired everywhere it can be, but its rendering
code remains solely as the automatic fallback for Windows-over-SSH sessions,
where Textual can't read the keyboard over the OpenSSH ConPTY (see
``_new_picker_blocked_by_ssh`` in ``__main__.py``). That fallback is
unconditional and not user-configurable.

    With no source: ``live=True`` selects the multi-machine SSH source
    (``data_ssh``, async per-machine loader); otherwise the local-only source
    (``data_local``). Returns ``app.result``, which the caller maps onto a
    resume/create action.

    ``mock_mode`` (default ``None`` -> resolved from the environment) is the
    explicit dev sandbox: real data is shown but mutating actions are simulated
    (no side effects). It never turns on implicitly -- see
    ``engine._resolve_mock_mode``.

    ``after_first_refresh`` is an optional no-argument housekeeping callback.
    The screen starts it on a daemon worker only after Textual completes its
    first refresh. It must not mutate Textual widgets; UI changes still
    belong on the render thread via the screen's ``Inbox`` (``inbox.py`` --
    see its module docstring and ``inbox.Inbox.post()``), never a raw
    ``app.call_from_thread`` call.

    Launch-channel handling: this runs inside ``resolve``, whose **stdout
    (fd 1) is captured by the launcher for the JSON plan**. Textual's driver
    renders to ``sys.__stdout__`` -- so when stdout is captured (not a TTY) but
    stderr is the terminal, point ``sys.__stdout__`` at stderr for the duration
    of the TUI. The plan is emitted to the real fd 1 after the app exits (and
    ``sys.__stdout__`` is restored). Mirrors the legacy picker's
    ``stdout_to_stderr`` redirect.
