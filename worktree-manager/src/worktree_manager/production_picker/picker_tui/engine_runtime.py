        ``update_stage.indicator_state()`` is a full ``agent-worktrees

        interpreter + CLI-module-import cost), not the "two small files" an
        earlier version of this docstring assumed -- measured at 2-2.5s on a
        loaded machine. This method used to call it synchronously from
        ``_tick`` every 5th frame (~2x/sec): since a single call already
        costs far longer than the interval between calls, the Textual
        render/input loop was blocked almost continuously, dropping/delaying
        keystrokes. Now it's wall-clock-throttled to
        :data:`UPDATE_STATE_POLL_SECS` and, when due, the actual subprocess

        :meth:`_poll_manager_update_state`'s existing pattern -- so this
        call always returns immediately and never blocks a keypress.

        exact fire time relative to that override is not guaranteed by pause
        count alone (Textual's mount lifecycle can defer it later than any
        fixed number of ``pilot.pause()`` calls), so an unconditional
        assignment here could silently clobber an explicit test/audit
        override moments after it was set -- a real, observed capture-race,
