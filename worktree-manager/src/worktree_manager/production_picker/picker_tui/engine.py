"""Textual rendering engine for the overhauled Worktree Picker.

Ported from the design prototype (test-chamber effort
``worktree-picker-tty-overhaul``). The engine is data-source agnostic: a
``PickerScreen`` is handed a *source* object exposing the same surface the
prototype's ``mockdata``/``livedata`` did (``LOCAL``, ``LOCAL_LABEL``,
``machines()``, ``load()``, ``bucket()``, ``for_machine()``). Production wires
a real source (``data_local`` / SSH); tests can pass a fixture source.

  ⇧Tab cycle views · / filter (stub) · r refresh · ? help · q/Esc back-or-quit

           flips as the scrollbar appears/disappears (or is re-measured during a
           single-row replace), so the wrap flickers in and out per keystroke.
           With no scrollbar the content width equals the widget width and is
           constant, so full-width rows fit exactly and never wrap -- fixing the
