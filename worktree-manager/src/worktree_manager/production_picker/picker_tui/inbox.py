"""The addressed, thread-safe mailbox feeding the Picker's render flow.

Per the Picker render-flow invariant (see ``architecture.md``'s "never block
on cross-process/IO" section): no cross-process call and no blocking IO may
ever run *on* Textual's single event-loop thread, so every producer of a UI
update runs off-thread. Before this module existed, each such producer
hand-rolled its own thread + ``app.call_from_thread`` + cancellation/error
bookkeeping (``_run_bg``, ``_apply_from_worker``, the setup-reload worker, ...)
-- several independent, subtly-different reimplementations of the same
shape, each a fresh place to get the thread-safety or the error handling
wrong.

``Inbox`` is the ONE sanctioned mechanism now: a background thread never
mutates a widget, never touches ``app.call_from_thread`` directly, and never
hand-rolls its own wake/flag -- it calls ``inbox.post(slot, value)``. The
owning screen/widget drains the inbox (on its own render tick, and/or its
``InboxUpdated`` message handler) and applies whatever is currently pending in
one batched pass. Multiple posts to the same slot between two drains coalesce
to the single latest value -- a fast-moving producer (a streaming loader, a
burst of near-simultaneous action results) never queues one apply per post.

Why ``post_message``, not ``app.call_from_thread``: Textual's own
``call_from_thread`` *raises* ``RuntimeError`` if called from the very thread
running the app's event loop -- a real footgun for a primitive meant to be
usable from literally anywhere, including synchronously from the owning
thread itself (e.g. a test, or a producer that sometimes short-circuits
inline). ``MessagePump.post_message`` has no such restriction: it is
unconditionally thread-safe and never raises on the caller's identity.

        owner) is logged, not propagated, since this is routinely called
        from a background worker thread where an uncaught exception is
        otherwise silently swallowed by the interpreter after printing a
        traceback nobody is watching for. Queues at most one
        ``InboxUpdated`` wake per batch of posts between two drains -- a
        burst of posts (even across many slots, even from many threads)
        never re-enters the event loop more than once for that batch.

        Called from the inbox's own **home thread** (the thread that
        constructed it -- normally the render/event-loop thread itself,
        e.g. a producer that short-circuits inline, or a synchronous unit
        test with no running event loop to ever post a wake INTO), posting
        drains and applies immediately instead of merely queuing: nothing
        else is going to pump an event loop that may not even be running,
        and there is no cross-thread race to guard against since this IS
        that thread.

        Returns ``True`` unless a *needed* wake failed to deliver (applied
        inline, or folded into an already-queued wake, both count as
        success). Most callers can ignore this -- the value is never lost
        either way, just possibly stuck until some other drain happens to
        run -- but a caller with its own diagnosability contract for "this
        update must become visible" (e.g. a first-load failure a poller
        elsewhere is watching for) can use a ``False`` return to fall back
        to a direct, off-thread diagnostic write of its own, the same
        documented, narrow exception already established for a producer
        with nowhere else to send an outcome.

        ``on_wake_failed``, if given, is called with the underlying
        exception ``post_message`` raised (or ``None`` if it instead
        returned ``False`` without raising -- an already-closing/closed
        pump) exactly when a *needed* wake genuinely fails to deliver.
        This is how a caller with its own diagnosability contract (like
        the one above) can recover the REAL cause instead of only a
        generic "could not wake" message -- the plain ``bool`` return
        alone can't carry that detail without changing what every other,
        ordinary caller of ``post()`` receives. Never called on the
        home-thread path (nothing there is a "wake failure" -- the value
        is applied directly, or recorded for later, not queued as a
        message at all); any exception IT raises is logged and swallowed,

        run on the render thread.

        This drains and discards EVERY pending slot, not just callable
        ones -- a non-callable value posted to an inbox that also uses
        ``drain_apply()`` would be silently consumed here without anyone
        reading it. An owner that mixes closure slots with named *data*
        slots (e.g. a streaming loader's latest batch, interpreted by the
        caller's own logic rather than invoked) must call ``drain()``
        directly and handle both shapes itself; it must not also call
        ``drain_apply()`` against the same inbox.

        ``drain()`` removes the whole batch up front, so every closure in
        it runs even if an earlier one raises -- a batch is independent
        producers' results, and one producer's failure must never cause a
        later, unrelated producer's own outcome to go silently unapplied.
        The first exception raised (in posting order -- ``_pending``
        preserves insertion order precisely so this is deterministic) is
        re-raised after every closure has had a chance to run; any further
        exception is logged, not swallowed, so it is at least diagnosable
        even though only one exception can propagate.

        Only ``Exception`` (not ``BaseException``) is caught here: a
        closure raising ``KeyboardInterrupt``/``SystemExit`` is a
        process-control signal, not an ordinary producer failure, and must
        propagate immediately like it would anywhere else -- never get
        captured, deferred past other closures, and re-raised later as if
        it were a regular exception. This also matches
        ``engine_runtime._drain_inbox()``'s own boundary catch, which only
