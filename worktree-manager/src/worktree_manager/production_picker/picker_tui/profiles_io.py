"""Load / apply terminal-profile columns for the Picker's Profiles grid.

Bridges the engine's host x target grid to the persisted **own-column** model
(``agent_worktrees.profiles``): each host machine owns one column. Reading the
whole grid means reading every reachable host's column; applying a column writes
*that host's* config (and mirrors it to its terminal profiles).

- **Local host** -- read/write in-process via ``agent_worktrees.profiles`` and
  mirror via ``terminal_fragment.deploy_fragment`` (Phase 3e Step 6,
  copilot-extensions#3390 -- Terminal Fragment deploy is now owned here, not
  proxied back into agent-worktrees).
- **Remote host** -- shell ``worktree-manager profiles get|apply`` over the
  machine's SSH alias (argv from ``data_ssh.profiles_argv``).

The SSH runner is injected (default: real subprocess) so tests drive this with
no network.
