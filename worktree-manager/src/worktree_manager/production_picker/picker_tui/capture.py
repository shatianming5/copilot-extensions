"""Deterministic capture of the picker's rendered screen -- for audit + tests.

The picker is a *deterministic renderer*: given injected ``source`` data, the
composed segment/region widget tree paints the same character grid every time
(topbar, pivots, machine tabs, borders, body window, footer). Capture reads that
grid straight off Textual's **compositor** -- the live composited display -- and
serializes it (styles stripped, with ANSI colour, or as an SVG). So any state can
be exported as a human-auditable **SVG screenshot** or captured as a **character
grid** a test asserts against, with no live terminal and no human watching.
(Overlays are native Textual ``ModalScreen``s since #88 F4, drawn by the
compositor rather than the base screen; capture one with
:func:`capture_modal_async`, the app-level seam.)

Realizes the picker vision's Features/``auditable-testable-rendering`` and
Behaviors/``renderable-and-assertable-headless`` (rides on
Features/``programmatic-parity`` -- known inputs, known grid).

Three capture forms, one seam:

- :func:`screen_to_text`  -- the plain character grid (styles stripped). Stable
  across platforms; the natural golden for layout / labels / focus-cursor
  position.
- :func:`screen_to_ansi`  -- the character grid *with* ANSI color. A
  colour-aware, still text-diffable golden for asserting semantic state colour.
- :func:`screen_to_svg`   -- the rendered state as a standalone SVG (colours
  preserved) for a human (or an agent) to eyeball.

:func:`capture` / :func:`capture_async` spin the picker headlessly over a given
``source``, optionally drive it to a target state, and return all three forms.
