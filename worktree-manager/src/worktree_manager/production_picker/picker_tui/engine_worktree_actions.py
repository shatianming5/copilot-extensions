        must always expose *some* lifecycle verb (Stop when muxed, else Reclaim)
        -- never strand the row with no way to act on it.

        True when there is **no live mux** AND any of:

        * ``session_bare_orphan`` -- the machine-wide scan flagged a **bare**
          (un-muxed) bound Copilot (#662/#1416).
        * a live bound lock -- ``session_lock_live`` (authoritative menu-open
          verdict) or ``session_bound_live`` (cached off-hot-path hint) -- whose
          homing could not be positively classified ``bare``.
        * ``session_bridge_live`` -- a live **bridge-owned** Copilot (#4272),
          read file-first from ``bridge.lock`` (cwd=home, so invisible to the
          mux + cwd-keyed lock scans -- #1416). Without this, an

          would fall through to Resume/Bare-resume -- which then FAIL because the
          bridge Copilot already holds the session -- stranding the row.
          ``reclaim_one`` resolves the bridge.lock's owner pid (via
          :func:`reclaim.resolve_bridge_bound`) so this verb actually reaps it.
        * ``session_lock_stale`` -- stale ``inuse.<pid>.lock`` residue from a
          crashed/killed session (file present, pid dead). Reclaim clears it to
          zero ("to the point where the pid lock file is removed").

        The **no-mux guard** keeps Reclaim mutually exclusive with the muxed

        cross-plugin verbs, which need engine state.
