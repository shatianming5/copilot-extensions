"""Textual rendering engine for the overhauled Worktree Picker.

Ported from the design prototype (test-chamber effort
``worktree-picker-tty-overhaul``). The engine is data-source agnostic: a
``PickerScreen`` is handed a *source* object exposing the same surface the
prototype's ``mockdata``/``livedata`` did (``LOCAL``, ``LOCAL_LABEL``,
``machines()``, ``load()``, ``bucket()``, ``for_machine()``). Production wires
a real source (``data_local`` / SSH); tests can pass a fixture source.

    Windows Terminal (and most terminals, by the classic meta-key convention)
    emits ``ESC`` + ``CR`` (``\\x1b\\r``) for Shift+Enter -- it does *not* emit
    the Kitty ``\\x1b[13;2u`` sequence, even with the Kitty protocol pushed
    (verified empirically: Shift+Enter -> ``\\x1b\\r`` under kitty flag 1, flag
    15, and xterm modifyOtherKeys alike). Textual's ``XTermParser`` then
    reissues that ``ESC``+``CR`` char-by-char, and because ``\\r`` is a tuple
    entry in ``ANSI_SEQUENCES_KEYS`` the ``alt``/meta flag is dropped -- so
    Shift+Enter collapses to a plain ``enter``, indistinguishable from Enter
    (which we bind to accept+advance). That is why Shift+Enter "just advanced".

    The parser looks up the *whole* ``\\x1b\\r`` sequence in
    ``ANSI_SEQUENCES_KEYS`` **before** the collapsing char-by-char reissue, so
    registering it there makes the atomic ESC+CR resolve to a real
    ``shift+enter`` key event (Textual already decodes the Kitty ``\\x1b[13;2u``
    form to the same key, so both encodings converge). This is the app-side
    equivalent of what Copilot-CLI does: accept meta+Enter as the newline. A
    lone ``ESC`` is untouched (it still resolves to ``escape``), so the form's
    Esc = save+close is preserved.

    An ``isatty()`` check at spawn time (``run_tui_picker``) only rejects a
    launch that never had a real terminal to begin with; it cannot detect a
    genuinely-interactive-at-spawn session whose owning terminal is later torn
    down without the child process noticing (observed on book2: a resident
    Picker process pair surviving for hours, discoverable only via a process
    census). Rather than attempt a platform-specific "is my controlling
    terminal still alive" probe -- there is no single reliable cross-platform
    signal for that short of a failed read/write, and Textual's own driver
    already surfaces those as a crash (logged by
    ``_write_picker_crash_log``) when they occur -- this bounds the exposure
    the same way the engine's resident status-monitor bounds its own orphaned
    instances: a generous, self-retiring idle timeout. A picker with zero
    real input events (keys/mouse/paste; background poll/render timers do NOT
    count) for this many seconds exits gracefully, same as the user
    confirming "quit" with no launch decision made.

    Conservative default (30 minutes) so normal interactive use -- reading a
    long worktree list, stepping away briefly -- is never affected.
