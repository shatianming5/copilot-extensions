"""Runtime for cross-plugin *registered* pivots in the Textual picker.

A registered pivot (see :mod:`picker_tui.pivots`) declares a ``list`` command
that prints a JSON array of entries, and an ``actions`` set of argv templates.
This module runs those commands -- always as a subprocess against the
contributing plugin's CLI on ``PATH``, never a cross-venv Python import -- so
the picker stays decoupled from the plugin's runtime.

That decoupling has to cover the child's *environment* too: the picker itself
is one plugin's own process (agent-worktrees), so its environment can carry
agent-worktrees-scoped identity vars (``COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT``,
``COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT``, and friends). A pivot's ``list``/action
command is almost always a *different* plugin's CLI (e.g. ``agent-dispatch``);
inheriting those vars unchanged makes that CLI's own installation-context
self-check see a foreign plugin root and reject the invocation outright (a
"payload context mismatch" that has nothing to do with the actual command).
Every subprocess this module spawns therefore runs under
:func:`_child_process_env`, never the picker's raw ``os.environ``.

:class:`RegisteredPivotRuntime` keeps the picker responsive: the ``list``
command runs on a daemon thread and the result is cached per machine, so the
render loop only ever reads a snapshot. Everything degrades gracefully -- a
missing CLI, a non-zero exit, or malformed JSON becomes an ``error`` state the
pivot surfaces, never an exception that breaks the picker.

    transitively, its own ``roster``/``provider_sources``/``source_identity``)
    on first use, so a picker with no registered pivots never pays that cost.
    But that meant the *first* switch onto a registered pivot (e.g. Tasks)
    paid a real, synchronous multi-module import on the render/key-handling
    thread -- profiling a real tab-switch keypress showed it accounting for
    roughly 40% of the total switch latency, exactly the momentary freeze
    reported against this pivot (see the Tasks-pane-UX-overhaul effort's own
    bug entry). A pure import has no side effects, so warming it here makes
    that cost disappear from the keypress entirely instead of relocating it.

    Also imports ``pivots`` (profiled at ~0.6s cold, non-trivial):
    ``_setup_live_pivots()``'s own registry scan imports it moments later on
    this same thread, but the FIRST render-thread call that needs it --
    ``_wt_submenu_verbs()``'s cross-plugin action loop, reached the instant
    the operator opens ANY worktree row's Actions menu -- can race ahead of
    that scan now that the picker paints (and accepts keys) immediately.

    another render-thread caller to pay for it first.

    Call this directly from a thread that is *already* off the UI thread
    (e.g. ``engine.py``'s ``_setup_live_pivots``) so the import reliably
    finishes before pivots are installed/activated -- spawning ANOTHER
    background thread here instead would only shrink the freeze window
    rather than close it: CPython's per-module import lock would still make
    a render-thread caller block on the same import if a keypress landed
    mid-warm-up. A caller reachable from the UI thread (the shared non-live
