"""Closure-descriptor interpretation shim for the Worktree Picker.

``picker_tui/derive.py`` resolves ``from .. import prune`` to this module, one
level up from ``picker_tui`` to ``production_picker`` -- mirroring
``agent_worktrees/picker_tui``'s own ``from .. import prune`` (that resolves
to ``agent_worktrees/prune.py``). Worktree Manager has no runtime dependency
on the ``agent-worktrees`` plugin package, so this is a small, deliberately
duplicated copy of just the one function the Picker needs, not an import of
the plugin's module.

Only ``interpret_descriptor_payload`` (plus the ``DESCRIPTOR_VERSION`` it
gates on) is needed by ``derive.py`` -- the rest of ``agent_worktrees/
prune.py`` (finalization/cleanup planning) has no Picker-side caller and is
deliberately not duplicated here. Keep this function byte-for-byte in sync
with ``agent_worktrees/prune.py``'s copy whenever that one changes -- a
dedicated cross-copy version-parity test (see
``tests/production_picker/test_prune_shim.py``) fails CI immediately if the
two ``DESCRIPTOR_VERSION`` values ever diverge.

    """Mixed-version fleet safety (Phase 5): interpret a raw closure-descriptor
    payload from a remote/cached source (e.g. a machine running an older or
    newer `agent-worktrees`) without trusting fields it may not understand.

    An absent (``None``/non-mapping), malformed, or version-mismatched
    payload is NEVER final or prune-safe -- it renders as an explicit
    ``unsupported-descriptor`` review state regardless of what the payload's
    own ``closure.final``/``action.disposition`` claim, so an out-of-version
    consumer degrades safely instead of guessing. Only an EXACT
    ``version == DESCRIPTOR_VERSION`` match is trusted (both an older and a
    newer version are rejected the same way -- neither side of a version
    skew can safely interpret the other's shape).

    A version-matched payload is still validated structurally before being
    trusted: ``closure``/``action``/``claims``/``follow_ups`` must each be
    present mappings; ``label``/``style``/``action.disposition``/``compact``
    must be actual ``str`` and ``closure.final`` an actual ``bool`` (never
    truthiness-coerced from a wrong type); ``label == "FINAL"`` must agree
    with ``closure.final``; a ``final: True`` payload must carry zero held
    claims, zero open follow-ups, and a ``safe`` action; and
    ``claims.held``/``follow_ups.open`` must be genuine non-negative ints
    (never a malformed value laundered into a ``0`` that would look like
    verified evidence of no blockers). Any violation degrades the whole
    payload to unsupported. Kept in sync with ``agent_worktrees/prune.py``'s
    copy.
