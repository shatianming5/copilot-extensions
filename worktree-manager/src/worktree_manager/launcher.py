"""Compose and execute a launch plan -- mux by capability (Phase 6b, DQ9).

The Manager's Picker resumes/launches a worktree by fetching a launch plan from
the engine (:func:`engine_client.resolve_launch_plan`, a pure process-boundary
read) and then *acting* on it here. This module is that executor -- and the one
place the **DQ9 mux-by-capability** rule lives:

- **The Worktree Manager owns mux.** ``agent-worktrees`` / ``agent-bridge`` only
  *detect-and-fall-back*; inside the Manager, multiplexing is a capability we add
  when a Manager-owned backend is present. The engine's ``resolve --json`` always
  sets ``no_mux`` (it must never spawn a mux in machine-readable mode), so the
  Manager's decision to mux is **its own**, gated on capability + intent -- not on
  the plan's ``no_mux`` flag.
- **Graceful degrade.** No Manager-owned mux backend has been relocated yet (DQ9
  deliberately does *not* force that split), so the default capability is
  *unavailable* and every launch runs **non-muxed / directly** -- which is exactly
  the current behavior. A real backend slots into :func:`set_mux_capability`
  without touching the :func:`compose_launch` / :func:`execute` seam.

Everything is kept a **pure** compose (:func:`compose_launch`) separate from the
side-effecting :func:`execute`, so the composition -- including whether a launch
would be muxed -- is unit-testable with a fake capability and never spawns a real
Copilot.
