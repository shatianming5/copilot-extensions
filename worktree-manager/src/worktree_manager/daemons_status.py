"""Phase 1 observability for resident mux-daemons (copilot-extensions#5001).

Resident per-version mux-daemons accumulate indefinitely today: a cutover is
only attempted opportunistically, and a superseded daemon with even one
still-attached client blocks its own retirement forever (see the issue for
the full background). Before any retirement sweep can be built (later
phases), there needs to be ground truth on what is actually resident right
now -- this module enumerates every resident mux-daemon matched to a given
root and reports its identity (pid/port), whether it is the routing table's
current active endpoint, and -- for a reachable one -- its own reported
version, attached-client count, and busy state.

This is read-only: it never drains, terminates, or otherwise mutates any
daemon. Phases 2+ (retirement) are tracked separately in the same issue.
