"""A fake **contributed pivot** provider for preview mode.

Run as ``python -m worktree_manager.demo_pivot list``. Prints a JSON array of
synthetic entries in the shape the generic pivot renderer
(``production_picker.picker_tui``) expects from any manifest-declared ``list``
command -- the same contract a real plugin (e.g. ``agent-containers fleet
--json``) fulfills. Themed to match ``demo.py``'s Example Labs fixture, so a
preview screenshot showing this pivot alongside the (also faked) Worktrees
pivot is obviously synthetic.

This module has no dependency on the real pivot-manifest scanning code --
``preview.py`` is what wires it into the registry, by injecting a plain
manifest (see its own module docstring) that names this module's ``list``
invocation as the pivot's data source. Kept here, not in ``preview.py``,
because it must be import-light and independently invocable as a subprocess
argv target (the pivot contract expects a subprocess, never an in-process
call).
