"""Example Labs demo fixture — mock worktrees for building/validating the Picker.

Because the Manager reaches the engine only across a process boundary
(``engine_client``), the Picker can be built, screenshotted, and demoed with a
**fake engine** that emits this fixture — no live ``agent-worktrees`` required.
The data is deliberately themed (Example Research / Cave Johnson) so a demo
screenshot is obviously synthetic and never leaks real machine/repo/session
particulars.

The rows match the engine's ``list --json --classify`` shape (contract v1), so
``engine_client._to_worktree`` parses them exactly as it parses the real engine.

The bulk of the roster below (the "management memo" titles: terse, absurd
tasks inflicted on the staff, exactly the tone of a Cave Johnson memo that
treats employees as expendable test subjects rather than people) is scraped
verbatim from ``docs/assets/worktree-picker.png`` -- the original Textual-
picker-era screenshot (``v1.0.0``, 2026-07-25) -- so the durable mock source
and the historical baseline stay the same voice rather than drifting apart.
The original 7-row roster (the "Portal quote" titles referencing Iris, the
Companion Cube, the cake, etc.) predates that screenshot and keeps the same
row structure and compatibility-facing cues after placeholder-only neutralization
(see ``test_picker_app.py``'s "lemons"/"Iris" assertions). ``_MEMO_TITLES`` is
deliberately separated from ``_ROWS`` so a
future generator (more volume than this fixed roster) has a clearly-labeled,
reusable bank of on-theme phrasing to draw from or extend, rather than
needing to reverse-engineer the tone from prose scattered through this file.
