<p align="center"><em>The <strong>Worktree Picker</strong> — the front door to your fleet of
worktree-backed agents, at a glance across every machine.</em></p>

A [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli)
plugin suite that gives every session its **own isolated git worktree** and lets
your agents **talk to each other** — across worktrees, across machines, and into
**GitHub Codespaces** and **local dev containers** — with credentials forwarded
securely along the way. The **agent-mcp** plugin wraps authenticated **MCP
servers** so those same host credentials reach your tools.

Plugins, one marketplace. Install what you need; they compose.

## Quick start — one-line setup

Bootstrap a machine into a working harness with the standalone **Configurator**
— an out-of-plugin app that installs the prerequisites and the core, then adopts
your first repo (it must run *before* the plugins do, so it is delivered
**outside** the plugin pipe).

> **Status — not yet available.** The Configurator is being built under
> [#352](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/352) (a Phase 0
> skeleton today; prerequisite + core install land next). **Until it ships**, set
> up **today** by installing the plugins from the marketplace — start with
> **agent-worktrees** (see the table below and its
> [Getting Started](plugins/agent-worktrees/docs/getting-started.md)), then add the
> others as you need them.

When it ships, one line will bootstrap a machine:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/main/configurator/bootstrap.ps1)
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/main/configurator/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

| Plugin | Type | What it gives you |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| [agent-worktrees](plugins/agent-worktrees/) | Session tool | Each Copilot CLI session runs in its own git worktree — no branch conflicts, no stale state. Install this first. |
| [agent-pull-requests](plugins/agent-pull-requests/) | Cross-repo PR CLI | Query and eventually drive pull requests by explicit `owner/repo`, even when no local checkout exists. This first runtime-backed slice ships a standalone `status` verb, deploys a real `~/.local/bin/agent-pull-requests` binstub, and stages the broader extraction from `agent-worktrees`. |
| [agent-bridge](plugins/agent-bridge/) | Persistent service | Converse with and steer live agents across worktree, repository, machine, CodeSpace, and container boundaries. |
| [agent-codespaces](plugins/agent-codespaces/) | CLI + relay | Create/manage GitHub Codespaces, address them as bridge agents (`codespace:<name>`), and forward git/GitHub/Azure credentials into them. |
| [agent-containers](plugins/agent-containers/) | CLI + resolver | Manage a fleet of local Docker dev containers, borrow/release them per effort, and address them as bridge agents (`container:<name>`). |
| [agent-mcp](plugins/agent-mcp/) | MCP bridge | Wrap an upstream MCP server (HTTP or stdio), inject host credentials, reshape its catalog, and materialize a bridge-equivalent fallback. Agent authoring policy remains in `customizing-copilot`. |
| [agent-ssh](plugins/agent-ssh/) | SSH connectivity CLI | Emit and verify machine-name SSH profiles from a normalized registry, and define the public transport-provider contract for direct or tunnel transports. |
| [agent-remote-driver](plugins/agent-remote-driver/) | SDK extension | User-global, launch-time SDK extension giving any `copilot` session baseline drivability (attach to its live event stream, send/steer, abort) over a loopback HTTP surface, independent of agent-bridge or any other coordination plugin being installed in that venue. Payload-only — no runtime to install. Not yet enabled by default (`cli-default-bridging` effort, pre-validation). |
| [efforts](plugins/efforts/) | Planning skills | Plan a stretch of work as an **effort** — a folder with a README-as-shared-contract (premise + plan + journal) that humans and agents coordinate through. The executor plugins above bind its participant seam. |
| [visions](plugins/visions/) | Planning skills | Keep a persistent **vision** — a north-star statement of what a system should ultimately be — and derive efforts from the delta between vision and reality. Payload-only — no runtime to install. |
| [agent-logger](plugins/agent-logger/) | Session logging | Turn raw Copilot sessions into structured Markdown logs — a segmenter, a voice-neutral log-writer agent, and a `session-sync` step that pushes local or validated provider-rescued session data to a configurable target (local / OneDrive / SSH / ingest). Personality is injected by the host, never built in. |
| [context-handoff](plugins/context-handoff/) | Ambient policy + extension + skill | Keep a continuity contract active through a concise session-start kernel, watch the context window via a session extension, and transfer unfinished objectives into successor sessions before compaction. Payload-only — no runtime to install. |
| [agent-dispatch](plugins/agent-dispatch/) | Task queue + coordinator | Manage durable queued task loops with deduplication, atomic claims, routing, retries, supervision, terminal task state, and declarative repository review or issue loops. |
| [agent-index](plugins/agent-index/) | Index/search service | Portable indexing and semantic-search engine for a harness repo and its immediate ecosystem. Phase 1 ships the service shell; indexing and retrieval arrive in later slices. |
| [agent-machines](plugins/agent-machines/) | Machine-state reconciler | Portable restore-machinestate — converge a machine to desired state declared in in-repo requirement packages (Copilot settings first). Machine-scoped union restore, a seven-disposition model, and a detect-not-arbitrate conflict validator. Its self-update sweep now runs only the maintenance-safe restore subset (manage reconciliation, opted-in resources, pinned installed-package realignment, and runtime spot checks). |
| [agent-vault](plugins/agent-vault/) | CLI + service | Local KeePassXC-backed secret store — a machine-local service caches the master password with a TTL and auto-prompts on lock; a CLI fetches API keys, SSH keys, and credentials on demand without hardcoding, committing, or env-exporting them. Ships a SUDO_ASKPASS helper for `sudo -A`. |
| [customizing-copilot](plugins/customizing-copilot/) | Customizing and diagnosing the CLI | Teach an agent how to customize, diagnose, and extend the Copilot CLI — authoring skills, defining sub-agents, registering MCP servers, installing plugins, building a control-harness, reviewing customizations, diagnosing startup hangs, authoring `<repo>-harness` plugins, and setting up an instruction-projection sync worker. Eleven focused skills. Payload-only — no runtime to install. |
| [copilot-extensions-harness](plugins/copilot-extensions-harness/) | Operator harness | Portable owner-authored skills, the `clean-room-judge` evaluator agent, and an ambient pointer to the general-purpose, organization-neutral contribution boundary. Enable it in any control repo instead of hand-writing a per-repo narrative. Reference implementation of the `<repo>-harness` standard. Payload-only. |
| [wsl-setup](plugins/wsl-setup/) | Environment setup | Set up and troubleshoot WSL2 as a reachable, persistent service host — pick the networking mode (NAT + localhostForwarding vs mirrored), diagnose corp-network egress + host↔WSL loopback failures, and keep a distro alive for a hosted listener (e.g. sshd behind a Dev Tunnel). Ships a windowless keepalive helper. |
| [harness-knowledge](plugins/harness-knowledge/) | Binding skill | Bind a stateless control harness to its private **knowledge** repo, harness-first — ask for (or create) the knowledge repo, write the machine-local `knowledge_repo` pointer, and assemble a machine-local instructions fragment labeling the concrete harness/knowledge/product paths. Keeps the shareable harness tree generic + name-free. Payload-only. |
| [ai-attribution](plugins/ai-attribution/) | Ambient policy + skills | Keep publication and AI-attribution safety active through a concise payload-cwd-gated session-start kernel, host-qualified operator policy, an idempotent static-fallback setup skill, and an on-demand publication workflow. Payload-only; no runtime, network call, or authentication. |
| [delegation-guidance](plugins/delegation-guidance/) | **Deprecated** — no-op pointer | Migrated into `agent-conduct-guidance`'s delegation module. Kept installable so the name keeps resolving for existing adopters; ships no skills or projections of its own. |
| [budget-guidance](plugins/budget-guidance/) | Budget posture CLI | Resolve strict offline allowance, consumption, reset, freshness, rate, and ceiling readings into one attributable posture with JSON and concise human status. |
| [agent-conduct-guidance](plugins/agent-conduct-guidance/) | Ambient policy + skills | Consolidated, generally-good agent conduct guidance: one plugin hosting multiple independent ambient modules (instruction projection + paired skill each). Modules: process-spawn hygiene (spawn every ad hoc CMD/PowerShell/Python/Node/etc. child process headlessly, especially on Windows), coordinator-first delegation (route broad separable work into bounded sub-agent contexts while the coordinator retains synthesis and completion), and scratch-space hygiene (resolve a portable scratch root and a timestamped per-task subfolder before writing an ad hoc working file outside a repository). Payload-only; no runtime. |

All support **Windows** and **Linux/WSL** (macOS planned).

## Architecture at a glance

24 plugins, one marketplace. **Thirteen ship a runtime** (a `uv`-built venv under
a plugin-owned runtime root such as `~/.agent-*` or `~/.budget-guidance`, plus a
`~/.local/bin` binstub, deployed by the plugin's own installer); **eleven are
payload-only** — `efforts` (skills), `visions` (skills),
`context-handoff` (hook + session extension + skill), `customizing-copilot` (skills),
`copilot-extensions-harness` (skills + contribution-boundary hook), `wsl-setup` (skills),
`harness-knowledge` (skills), `ai-attribution` (hook + skill),
`delegation-guidance` (hook + skill), `agent-conduct-guidance`
(instruction projection + skill), and `agent-remote-driver` (SDK extension)
need no install beyond enabling the plugin.
Everything installs **from the marketplace** and runs
**from local install paths** — no git checkout required at runtime.

Each runtime plugin is itself a **Python package** (its `src/` plus vendored
`libs/`); the installer creates the venv with `uv venv` and installs the package
with `uv pip install <plugin_dir>`. See
[Quick Start](#quick-start) and [Architecture overview](docs/architecture.md)
for the payload-vs-runtime split.

## Quick Start

> Goal: from a fresh machine to *"send a prompt to my CodeSpace and get work
> done"* in a handful of steps. New to this? Read
> [Concepts](#concepts-the-control-harness-repo) first.

### Prerequisites

- **Copilot CLI** (`copilot` on PATH) · **Python 3.10+** · **Git 2.15+**
- **gh CLI**, authenticated (`gh auth login`) — for agent-codespaces and agent-containers
- **Docker** (Docker Desktop WSL2 backend) — for agent-containers only
- **uv** (bootstrapped automatically by the init scripts if missing)

### 1. Install the plugins

Install agent-worktrees first; add the others as you need them. agent-codespaces
and agent-containers **self-register** their `codespace:` / `container:`
namespaces with agent-bridge by dropping a `~/.agent-bridge/providers.d/`
manifest on session start — there is **no install-order requirement** and no
package import, so a provider installed at any time is discovered on demand.

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions
copilot plugin install agent-worktrees@copilot-extensions
copilot plugin install agent-codespaces@copilot-extensions
copilot plugin install agent-containers@copilot-extensions
copilot plugin install agent-bridge@copilot-extensions
copilot plugin install agent-mcp@copilot-extensions      # optional, standalone
copilot plugin install agent-logger@copilot-extensions   # optional — session logging
copilot plugin install agent-index@copilot-extensions    # optional — indexing/search service shell
copilot plugin install efforts@copilot-extensions        # optional — planning skills (no runtime)
copilot plugin install context-handoff@copilot-extensions # optional — context-window handoff (no runtime)
copilot plugin install customizing-copilot@copilot-extensions # optional — how to customize the CLI (no runtime)
copilot plugin install ai-attribution@copilot-extensions # optional — ambient publication safety (no runtime)
copilot plugin install agent-conduct-guidance@copilot-extensions # optional — consolidated agent conduct guidance (no runtime)
```

Each `copilot plugin install` only vendors the plugin's **payload** (source,
skills, hooks, extensions). The thirteen runtime plugins (every plugin except the
payload-only `efforts`, `visions`, `context-handoff`, `customizing-copilot`,
`copilot-extensions-harness`, `wsl-setup`, `harness-knowledge`, and
`ai-attribution`, `delegation-guidance`, and `agent-conduct-guidance`) then need their runtime deployed once — that's Step 2,
which runs each installer to build a `uv` venv under its plugin-owned home and drop a
binstub in `~/.local/bin`.

> **Recommended: register at repo scope instead of globally.** Set
> `"experimental": true` in `~/.copilot/settings.json`, then declare the
> marketplace + `enabledPlugins` in your control repo's committed
> `.github/copilot/settings.json`. Copilot vendors the payloads when a session
> runs in that repo (agent-worktrees may need a session restart to take effect),
> Step 2 deploys the runtimes, and every subsequent launch via the
> binstub/terminal profile runs `agent-worktrees reconcile-plugins` to keep the
> payloads and runtimes fresh automatically. See
> [`agent-worktrees:copilot-extensions-setup`](plugins/agent-worktrees/skills/copilot-extensions-setup/SKILL.md)
> § 0 and [install-contract.md](docs/install-contract.md).

### 2. Bootstrap the runtimes

Start a Copilot CLI session and say **"set up copilot extensions"** — the
[`agent-worktrees:copilot-extensions-setup`](plugins/agent-worktrees/skills/copilot-extensions-setup/SKILL.md)
skill runs each installer so the runtimes land under `~/.agent-*` with binstubs
in `~/.local/bin`. (Prefer to do it by hand? See each plugin's Getting Started,
linked below.)

Verify:

```bash
agent-worktrees --version
agent-bridge version && agent-bridge status
agent-codespaces version
agent-ssh version
```

### 3. Adopt your control-harness repo

Adopt your control repo (see [Concepts](#concepts-the-control-harness-repo)) so
worktrees, topology, and Codespaces all read from one place:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-control-harness
agent-worktrees register my-control-harness          # worktree sessions + binstub
agent-bridge config adopt --repo . --profile my-control-harness
agent-codespaces config adopt
```

### 4. First send — local, then CodeSpace

```bash
# Talk to a local agent (no SSH needed)
agent-bridge send local "Print the working directory and git branch."

# Talk to a CodeSpace through the bridge (auto-starts it; creds forwarded)
agent-codespaces bridge register
agent-bridge send "codespace:<name>" "Run: pwd && git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD && gh auth status"
```

---

## Concepts: the control-harness repo

A **control-harness repo** is your own repo (a dotfiles-style "hub") that drives
the whole system. In examples it's called `my-control-harness`. It:

- is **adopted by agent-worktrees** (gets a project binstub + worktree root),
- holds the **topology** the bridge reads — `machines.yaml` (machines + SSH) and
  `acp-agents.json` (agents), plus a supplementary `.agent-codespaces/config.yaml`
  (Codespace overrides + credential-relay policy; most repos need none) and
  `containers.yaml` (local dev-container fleet
  defaults), and
- doubles as the **Codespaces dotfiles repo**, so the same repo provisions each
  CodeSpace.

One repo, one source of truth, the mesh plugins reading from it. (agent-mcp is
standalone — its bridge configs are per-agent files, preferably in-repo via
`--config` for repo-scoped agents, or under `~/.agent-mcp/bridges/` for personal
ones; not the control repo.)

> **Building or auditing a harness?** Point an agent at the
> [Control-Harness Runbook](docs/harness-runbook.md) — an opinionated,
> phase-by-phase procedure for turning a repo into an effective agent harness
> with these plugins. It works from a fresh folder ("make me a control repo like
> this"), on an existing repo ("build out my harness"), or as an audit ("make
> sure my repo follows best practices").

---

## Usage flow: a CodeSpace session end-to-end

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You as Copilot CLI
    participant Bridge as agent-bridge
    participant CS as agent-codespaces
    participant Space as CodeSpace
    You->>Bridge: agent-bridge send "codespace:my-space" "..."
    Bridge->>CS: resolve codespace:my-space
    CS->>Space: gh codespace start (if Shutdown) + SSH (-R to the relay port)
    Bridge->>Space: spawn copilot --acp over SSH
    Space-->>CS: git / gh credential request to the local relay
    CS-->>Space: token (from GCM / gh auth)
    Space-->>Bridge: streamed response
    Bridge-->>You: response
```

The credential relay (port **9857**) means the CodeSpace authenticates to GitHub
and Azure DevOps using **your host's** credentials — no PATs baked into the
CodeSpace.

---

## Updating

```bash
# Pull the latest plugin from the marketplace…
copilot plugin update agent-worktrees@copilot-extensions

# …or update the plugin + runtime in one step
agent-worktrees update
```

agent-worktrees also auto-updates its runtime on session launch. agent-bridge
and agent-codespaces update via their installers (`scripts/install.* update`).
agent-containers and agent-mcp re-run their `scripts/init.*` (with `-Force` /
`--force`) to redeploy the runtime.

## Uninstalling / baseline reset

The installer-based plugins (agent-worktrees, agent-bridge, agent-codespaces)
provide an `uninstall` action that stops their **own managed processes** before
removing files — agent-bridge stops the daemon + credential relay, and
agent-codespaces closes its SSH ControlMaster connections — so no manual
process-killing is needed:

```bash
scripts/install.sh uninstall          # per-plugin (add --purge / --remove-config to wipe config)
```

agent-containers and agent-mcp are init-only (no installer): remove them by
deleting `~/.agent-containers` / `~/.agent-mcp` and their `~/.local/bin`
binstubs.

To return a machine to a clean baseline in one step (stops everything, removes
the installer-based runtimes, binstubs, the service/scheduled task, and config)
use the repo-level reset tool — it's idempotent and works even if the CLIs are
broken:

```powershell
# Windows
pwsh -File tools\reset.ps1                       # prompts; add -Yes to skip
pwsh -File tools\reset.ps1 -Yes -RemovePlugins   # also `copilot plugin uninstall`
```
```bash
# Linux/WSL
bash tools/reset.sh                              # prompts; add --yes to skip
bash tools/reset.sh --yes --remove-plugins
```

> The reset tool currently targets the installer-based runtimes
> (`~/.agent-worktrees`, `~/.agent-bridge`, `~/.agent-codespaces`); remove
> `~/.agent-containers` and `~/.agent-mcp` manually until it covers them.

Your source repos and their `.worktrees` content are never touched.
