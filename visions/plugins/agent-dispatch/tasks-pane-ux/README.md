## Purpose & Intent

The Worktrees pane earned its discipline the hard way: declarative columns, a
state-derived colour palette shared with the status bar, compact status
markers, and a rich per-row action menu. The Tasks pivot is the *other* half
of the same operator's mental model — "what is the fabric doing for me, and
what does it need from me" — but it never received the same investment. It
renders as a flat badge list with no phase colour, no visible link to the
worktree actually doing the work, no surfaced artifacts, and a thin action
set. An operator managing both worktrees and tasks today has one disciplined
view and one impoverished one, for what is conceptually the same lifecycle
viewed from two ends: a worktree is *where* work happens; a task is *why*.

This vision is the Tasks pivot growing into the Worktrees pane's peer: the
same colour discipline (reusing, not reinventing, the palette), an explicit
task↔worktree cross-link in both directions, a shared "prominent artifacts"
surface usable from either side, and a menu that lets the operator actually
**drive** the lifecycle — steer, abandon, reset, inspect a charter, drill into
the claiming worktree's live status, and hold or stop the agent working it —
without dropping to a CLI. It also extends "configuration is visible and
user-overridable" (already true for the enable/disable override store) into a
real **Registrars** viewer under the Configuration menu, so the master pause
is discoverable, not tribal knowledge.

The pane is also where the parent vision's manual, no-emitter task path
becomes something an operator can actually *drive end to end* rather than
script: a **New Task composer** to author and queue work by hand, at whatever
pace and volume the operator wants, and a **Completion Review card** to close
the loop the parent vision's *verify-the-completion-claim* leaves to a
self-tracked task's caller — confirm it, re-queue it with fresh steering, or
abandon it. Together they make the fully hand-driven propose → queue →
complete → review cycle require **no plugin, no registrar, and no opt-in**
beyond this pane and the coordinator/supervisor agent-dispatch already ships
with — the manual path is native, not an add-on.

## Concepts & Components

### The phase palette — one colour vocabulary, two lifecycles

Worktrees and tasks are different state machines (a worktree's git-derived
disposition vs. a task's `agent_dispatch.task_state_machine.Status` /
`agent-dispatch-board` group), but an operator's read of a colour should not
require knowing which machine produced it. A dedicated `task_phase` palette
(distinct from, but built from, the same named colours as the Worktrees
`state` palette) projects Proposed/Queued/Started/Blocked/Suspended/
Completed/Abandoned onto the same blue-actively-worked, amber-needs-attention,
green-done, grey-not-started, dark-grey-terminal meaning the Worktrees pane
already trained the operator to read at a glance. The two palettes are kept
separate so either vocabulary can evolve without silently reshading the
other.

### The task↔worktree cross-link — at most one, both directions

A task, once embodied, is claimed by exactly one worktree; the pivot
contract already carries this (`RegisteredPivot.worktree_field`, defaulting
to `entry.worktree`/`target_worktree`) but the Tasks pane never surfaced it as
a first-class, compact identity. Showing the claiming worktree's 4-digit id
directly in the Tasks table — and, symmetrically, the task's identity and
phase on the worktree side — makes the join legible without a mental hop
through two separate screens.

### Prominent artifacts — a shared claim-graph surface

Both a task and its claiming worktree accumulate a graph of claimed external
entities (pull requests, issues/bugs, and whatever else a registrar's
recipe claims). Rather than each side inventing its own artifact rendering,
this vision treats "1–2 prominent badges inline, full graph on drill-in" as
one shared surface, reachable from a task's menu *and* from the new Worktree
Status card (see below) — so a claim recorded from either angle reads the
same way.

### The Worktree Status card — the missing companion to Recent Messages

The Worktree Manager has long had a "Recent Messages" card stub for a
worktree, but no real **status** card: session lineage (which session
spawned, resumed, or succeeded which), an expanded descriptor (turn count,
commit count, claim count, live/idle/suspended), and the claims viewer. This
vision treats that card as a first-class citizen reachable from two places —
an embodied task's menu, and (eventually) a Worktrees-row drill-in — rather
than a Tasks-only special case, since the underlying worktree identity is
shared.

### The task menu — steer, view, and actually say "no"

Steering a blocked task already exists (`kind:"form"` + the `PivotFormScreen`
elicitation modal). This vision extends the SAME declarative action
mechanism — no new modal machinery needed for a read-only view, since
`kind:"card"` (`PivotCardScreen`) already exists — to cover: a charter viewer
(what this task *is*: description + structured metadata), the Worktree Status
card, and mutating verbs an operator needs to actually say "no": force-abandon
(already present), **reset to Proposed** (the gentler "not like this, but
don't kill the idea"), and, for an embodied task, **force-stop** the agent and
an explicit **pause** distinct from anything an agent would invoke on its own.

Pause is a genuine, durable **system state** — a per-task hold with its own
actor/reason/timestamp — not a UI-only flag, and not a reuse of the existing
system-recoverable `Suspended` state (which normal resume/recovery paths
already reopen on their own schedule). Every part of the dispatch flow
(claim, resume, wake-delivery, liveness recovery, release, supervisor
spawning) checks and honors the hold, not just the Picker's own display.
Pause's defining property is that it blocks agent-dispatch from re-queuing
the task until the operator explicitly unpauses it — a deliberate, visible
hold, distinct from both system-Suspended and Blocked/awaiting-steer, so a
forgotten pause reads as a stuck task demanding attention rather than a task
that silently vanishes from the active count or gets confused with an
unrelated system-recoverable state.

A task not yet embodied by a LIVE agent also gets **Open into a CLI
session** — a genuinely different embodiment path from a headless kick, not
"assign the pool's dedicated worker, then attach a terminal": it never
routes through the pool or a named worker identity's fixed
acting-theme/focus/rules — those rails exist to keep an *unattended*
headless agent on target, exactly what an operator opening a CLI session
does not want. Eligibility is fundamentally a **liveness** question, not a
raw-phase one: in principle a Started or Blocked task becomes eligible again
the moment its actual live session (CLI or headless) has died — the
dispatcher's own responsibility is to never let that state linger, by
auto-transitioning a task to Suspended the instant its active session/lease
is confirmed dead. A cheap phase-based approximation of "not currently live"
(Proposed / an unpooled Queued / Suspended) is then a correct, cheap read of
that invariant rather than a parallel, potentially-wrong check. Opening the
session runs a single atomic **interactive embodiment transaction**: create
the task's worktree if it has none (else resume its existing one), bind and
auto-claim the task to it under the same ownership/generation fencing a pool
claim would use, then seed the session with a succinct `--interactive`
context prompt (the task's charter, current phase, and its own tooling to
move the task's state). The agent is expected to set to work toward the
task's next phase, but — being genuinely non-railroaded — may pause and ask
the operator directly for instructions at any point; past that seed, the
operator has direct, open-ended control.

### The New Task composer — hand-authoring, made a first-class action

Every task on this pane today arrived through some producer other than the
operator directly typing one in — an emitter, a delegation, a schedule. But
the parent vision's *propose-then-queue* has always allowed a plain caller to
hand-author a task with no emitter behind it (*emitter-tasks-are-evaluated-
mine-are-tracked*); this pane never gave that path a surface. A **New task…**
action on the Tasks pivot — the direct peer of the Worktrees pane's **New
worktree…** — opens the same declarative composer machinery already proven
for steering (`kind:"form"` / `PivotFormScreen`): a title, a free-form
prompt/goal payload with the same steering-quality input box, and a
**tags & criteria picker** built from the exact vocabulary a pool's filter
already matches against — repo lane (defaults to the current one), required
and rejected capabilities, role, and task-type — so what the operator picks
*is* what routes the task to the right pool, with no derivation step standing
in for what an emitter would normally have supplied. Composing and submitting
is propose+queue in one motion, returns immediately, and is repeatable back
to back — an operator can queue an arbitrary run of hand-authored tasks
without waiting for any one of them to be claimed, embodied, or finished, and
the pools drain them exactly as they drain any other queued work.

### The Completion Review card — closing the self-tracked loop

A task authored through the New Task composer carries no evaluator, so per
the parent vision's *verify-the-completion-claim* nothing else corroborates
its worker's completion claim — the operator who queued it is the tracker,
and needs an actual surface to do that tracking on. The **Completion Review**
card is the direct counterpart of the steering card, at the other end of the
lifecycle: reached from a **completed** task that has not yet reached
**confirmed**, it shows what the worker actually reports done — its result
reference, the accumulated progress log, and any prominent artifacts it
claimed (reusing the same shared artifacts surface as the Worktree Status
card) — and offers exactly four honest next acts, never a silent fifth:
**Confirm** (the claim holds; close as confirmed), **Re-queue with steering**
(reuses the steering-card input verbatim; the task returns to queued with its
progress preserved and the operator's new instructions as the first thing the
next worker reads), **Abandon** (close as abandoned), or **Save for later**
(leave it exactly where it is). Per the parent vision's
*self-tracked-review-is-not-a-lane*, a saved-for-later card costs nothing —
no pool slot, no worker, no lane — so a whole backlog of unconfirmed
completions can sit safely until reviewed. For emitter-driven tasks whose
evaluator already auto-confirms, this card simply never has anything to show:
nothing sits completed-and-unconfirmed long enough to need it.

### Registrars configuration — the master pause, made visible

`agent_dispatch.overrides` already implements a durable, user-level
enable/disable store per registration (`set_override`/`clear_override`/
`overridden_off_ids`), and `agent_dispatch.registrar.ProfileDeclaration`
already carries everything worth showing about a registration (what recipe
or template it runs, its source repo or local-config origin, schedule and
concurrency limits, provenance). This vision closes the gap between "the
mechanism exists" and "the operator can see and use it": a Configuration →
Registrars view lists every registration with that metadata and lets the
operator flip the existing override — never add or remove a registration,
which stays an agent-chat-driven flow, since composing a new registration is
an authoring act, not a configuration toggle.

## Relationship to the Worktrees pane

This vision is deliberately **not** a rewrite of Worktrees, nor a merge of
the two panes into one. A worktree and a task are genuinely different units
(a worktree can exist with no task; a task can exist with no worktree yet)
and keeping them as sibling pivots that *cross-reference* rather than
*collapse* preserves that. What transfers is the **discipline** — palette,
compact status markers, a real action menu, a status-card drill-in — not the
schema.

## Non-Goals / Boundaries

- Re-deriving the task lifecycle's authoritative states; this vision reads
  `agent_dispatch.task_state_machine.Status` and `board_cli._group`, it does
  not invent a parallel vocabulary.
- A general-purpose claims/artifacts backend for arbitrary entity types; the
  scope here is surfacing whatever a registrar already claims, not building a
  new claim-tracking store.
- Repo-scoped **filtering** as a persisted, first-class UI axis (parallel to
  the Worktrees machine filter) — the repo *column* is in scope now; a
  dedicated filter chip is real, more invasive engine.py work, tracked as its
  own effort phase once the table design above is validated.
