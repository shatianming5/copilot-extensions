# agent-containers — Vision

- **Subject:** The **local-container venue provider** of the agent fabric — the
  plugin that provisions container-hosted agents, presents them through the
  fabric's coordination contract, and supports both trusted development and
  restricted low-trust work without confusing the two security postures.
- **Scope:** leaf (a per-plugin vision under the
  [agent-fabric](../../agent-fabric/README.md) branch)
- **Status:** Active
- **Last revised:** 2026-08-27
- **Reality docs:** [`docs/architecture.md`](../../../docs/architecture.md) and
  the plugin's [`README`](../../../plugins/agent-containers/README.md)

## Purpose & Intent

A container agent should be a first-class participant in the agent fabric
without every container inheriting the authority of the host that launched it.
agent-containers provides local, disposable, repo-shaped venues and makes their
security posture an explicit part of the venue rather than an assumption hidden
in launch defaults.

The restricted posture is primarily **mistake containment** for a fallible or
weaker worker model: a destructive shell command, unsafe tool choice, or
prompt-injected instruction should damage at most a disposable container and
its one repository workspace. It is not premised on an omnipotent hostile
tenant defeating the container runtime. Defense stays proportionate: preserve
hard host-filesystem and credential boundaries, keep rescued bytes allowlisted
and analysis-only, and prevent arbitrary internet reach, without accumulating
mechanisms whose only value is resisting an actively malicious in-container
adversary.

The provider serves two legitimate modes. A **trusted development venue** may
borrow host capabilities needed for ordinary engineering work — and, more than
that, aims to project **as much of the harness as possible** into the container
(its plugins/skills, the credential relay, launch parity, and — as the
capability matures — **multiple repositories and their worktrees living
container-local**), so a trusted container becomes a **seamless agent-bridge
node** on par with a CodeSpace rather than a stripped-down runner. A
**restricted venue** is a security boundary for lower-trust or injection-prone
reasoning: its blast radius is the container and its one repository workspace,
host credentials do not cross the boundary, network reach and tools are
explicitly granted, and the failure mode is a disposable bad diff rather than
host impact. In the restricted mode the provider deliberately does **little more
than wrangle the container runtime** and hand over an à-la-carte tool surface —
the host agent and scenario decide what to use. Both remain the same kind of
fabric participant; trust changes authority (and how much of the harness is
projected), not the coordination interface.

## Concepts & Components

### Trust-profiled venue
Every fleet has a legible trust posture. The trusted-development profile
preserves the productive host-integrated venue; the restricted profile removes
ambient authority and admits capabilities explicitly. Callers can determine
the effective posture before dispatch.

### Container as the boundary
For restricted work, containment rests on the container runtime and its
resource, filesystem, privilege, and network boundaries — never on instructions
asking the agent to behave. The harness running inside is replaceable; the
containment contract is not.

### Repository-shaped workspace
The agent receives a full repository clone inside its container and can use
ordinary local version control there. It does not receive a shared host
worktree or visibility into unrelated host paths. The host owns venue and
workspace lifecycle.

### Restricted session-evidence rescue
A restricted venue may surrender its Copilot session evidence to a host-owned
consumer before the disposable container is replaced. Rescue preserves the
record needed for later analysis without turning the venue's home, repository,
or worktrees into durable shared state.

### Explicit capability envelope
Credentials, network reach, environment values, tools, and resource budgets are
capabilities of the fleet profile. Restricted venues begin without ambient host
capability and gain only named grants appropriate to their assignment.

### Controlled information ingress
Prompt-injection exposure is chiefly bounded by egress and information-source
choice. A restricted worker has no arbitrary internet access; its intended
online surface is the configured repository forge plus a controlled basic-search
interceptor, with any further endpoint granted explicitly.

### Coordination-layer face
Trusted and restricted containers are presented through the same
`container:` venue-provider contract. The coordination layer addresses the
participant uniformly while the provider enforces the venue's effective
posture.

## Features

### trust-separated-fleet-profiles
Fleets declare whether they are trusted development venues or restricted
sandboxes. Existing trusted-development use remains available, while restricted
work has a first-class posture rather than a fragile collection of caller
conventions.

### full-harness-projection-trusted
A trusted-development fleet aims to be a **full harness node**, not a minimal
runner. The host projects its **launch parity** (model, the repo's own
local-marketplace plugins/skills, concrete workspace cwd), the **credential
relay**, and — as the capability matures — **multiple repositories and their
worktrees created container-local** inside the venue, so agent-bridge drives a
trusted container as seamlessly as any other venue. The goal is to make the
container transport *invisible*: as much of the system as can be projected, is.
Restricted fleets deliberately receive none of this by default (see
`restricted-credential-boundary` / `harness-and-tool-latitude`).

### restricted-credential-boundary
A restricted venue receives no host credential, credential relay, or ambient
identity. If an assignment later needs an identity, it is a distinct,
least-privilege identity granted explicitly for that venue — never an accidental
inheritance of the host's authority.

### worktree-confined-repository
A restricted venue exposes exactly its container-local repository workspace for
agent work. Other host worktrees and host filesystem state remain outside the
venue.

### explicit-network-envelope
Network access for a restricted fleet is intentional and bounded to what its
assignment requires. A venue that needs its model endpoint, repository forge,
and controlled basic-search interceptor does not thereby gain ambient internet
or reach to every host and network service.

### harness-and-tool-latitude
The provider can launch a full agent CLI, a smaller harness, or a purpose-built
runner with an explicitly selected tool surface. The venue does not force
trusted-development tool authority onto restricted work.

### observable-security-posture
Machine-readable fleet state reports the effective trust posture and capability
envelope so dispatchers can verify the boundary they are about to use instead
of inferring it from configuration.

### bounded-disposable-execution
Restricted fleets can bound compute and process resources so a runaway agent is
contained, and their venues can be discarded without losing the session evidence
the host explicitly rescued or the repository proposal they already published.

### recoverable-restricted-session-evidence
Restricted fleets expose a narrow, host-driven rescue seam for Copilot
session-state. The export is suitable for asynchronous analysis and shared-corpus
ingest; it does not preserve or restore the container's workspace, settings, or
runtime identity.

### active-session-safe replacement
A new image or policy may be prepared while a restricted venue is active, but
replacement never destroys the container beneath a live agent session or turn.
The old instance remains marked drifted and usable by its current owner until it
reaches a safe boundary.

## Behaviors

### deny-by-construction
In a restricted venue, absent capability is structurally unavailable. A prompt,
tool call, or harness mistake cannot recover a host credential, mount an
unrelated host path, add privilege, or widen network reach after launch.

### proportionate-mistake-containment
Restricted safeguards prioritize the realistic failure modes: mistaken system
commands, destructive tool use, prompt-injected actions, active-session
replacement races, and unintended data or credential reach. Defense-in-depth at
the host boundary and rescue allowlist remains mandatory, while design
complexity must earn its place against those concrete failures rather than an
assumed all-powerful hostile worker.

### secure-restricted-defaults
Selecting the restricted profile produces a coherent safe baseline without
requiring every caller to remember a list of hardening flags. Additional grants
are explicit, narrow, and legible.

### trusted-compatibility
Existing trusted-development fleets retain their established behavior unless
their configuration deliberately selects a different posture.

### same-fabric-contract
Trust posture does not fork the coordination API. A restricted container is
created, discovered, leased, and addressed through the same venue-provider
contract as a trusted one.

### no-shared-worktree-boundary
A restricted venue never relies on a shared host git worktree. Its repository
state is container-local, so branch ownership and worktree metadata cannot
escape or dangle across the boundary.

### rescue-before-destructive-replacement
A planned destructive replacement first attempts an atomic, allowlisted rescue
of session-state to a host-owned destination **while the container is still
running**. A failed rescue blocks stop/removal unless an explicit force/abandon
decision accepts the loss. Periodic or turn-boundary checkpoints may reduce the
unrescued tail after an unexpected container loss; the next venue still starts
clean. A peer, non-destructive **capture** trigger (`rescue-capture`) may also
pull session-state on demand while the container keeps running, independent of
any destructive replacement -- gated by the same active-session liveness probe
so a live turn is never snapshotted mid-write. Whether/how a capture runs
periodically is downstream consumer configuration, not something this plugin
schedules itself.

### drain-live-session-before-replace
Provider and session liveness are checked immediately before replacement. A live
turn, live session, or active lease blocks recreation; the venue drains or ends
at a turn boundary, rescues its session evidence, verifies that rescue, and only
then releases and replaces the container. Deployment itself may report drift but
does not imply termination.

### policy-legible-before-dispatch
The provider exposes enough effective posture for a caller to reject an
incorrect venue before starting an agent. Security is not a promise discoverable
only after inspecting a running process.

## Non-Goals / Boundaries

- **Not a merge or deployment authority.** The provider supplies a venue and
  local repository workspace; contribution review, merge, deployment, and
  worktree lifecycle policy belong to higher orchestration layers.
- **Not prompt-based safety.** Instructions may guide an agent, but they are not
  the containment boundary.
- **Not a hostile multi-tenant security product.** Restricted venues do not
  claim to withstand an omnipotent adversary controlling the container; the
  container runtime is trusted, and the posture is optimized for accidental and
  prompt-injected blast-radius containment.
- **Not one mandatory harness.** Containment must survive replacing the agent
  harness.
- **Not ambient host identity for restricted work.** A restricted venue never
  impersonates the host by default.
- **Not a shared host worktree.** Host workspace mounts are outside the
  restricted model.
- **Not workspace/session resume.** Session rescue preserves evidence for later
  consumers; it does not rehydrate a prior Copilot session or container
  workspace into a replacement venue.

## Provenance

- **2026-08-22** — Split the container provider's trust model into explicit
  trusted-development and restricted postures after identifying that host
  credential forwarding and broad tool authority are useful defaults for the
  former but unsafe foundations for the latter.
- **2026-08-23** — Enriched the **trusted** side with `full-harness-projection`
  intent (operator direction): a trusted fleet should project as much of the
  harness as possible — launch parity, relay, and eventually container-local
  worktrees + multi-repo — to become a seamless agent-bridge node, while the
  **untrusted/restricted** mode stays a bounded substrate where the provider
  mostly wrangles the container runtime and offers à-la-carte tools. This is the
  container-side complement of the `venue-parity` vision.
- **2026-08-27** — Added restricted session-evidence rescue after a real
  replacement demonstrated that ephemeral Copilot state otherwise disappears.
  The venue remains disposable: only allowlisted session-state leaves for
  asynchronous analysis, and replacements start with fresh runtime/workspace
  state.
- **2026-08-27 (replacement safety)** — Clarified the operational trigger:
  deploying a newer image must not recreate a container under an active agent.
  Liveness/lease guards, turn-boundary drain, verified session-state rescue, then
  replacement are the required sequence.
- **2026-08-27 (threat model)** — Clarified that restricted venues chiefly
  contain mistaken/destructive commands from fallible workers. Arbitrary
  internet is absent; repository and controlled-search access are narrow grants.
  Host credential/filesystem boundaries and rescue allowlists remain hard, but
  complexity aimed only at an omnipotent malicious tenant is out of scope.
