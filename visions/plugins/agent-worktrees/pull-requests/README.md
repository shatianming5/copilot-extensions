# agent-worktrees pull-request capability — Vision

- **Subject:** The **complete, provider-neutral pull-request capability**
  agent-worktrees exposes — one surface for author-side and reviewer-side PR
  operations against any registered repo, addressable by any authorized
  caller regardless of local checkout, and verifiable through a shared
  conformance contract that lets a fabricated provider stand in for a real
  one with confidence.
- **Scope:** leaf (child of the
  [agent-worktrees](../README.md) plugin vision)
- **Status:** Draft
- **Last revised:** 2026-09-20
- **Reality docs:** the agent-worktrees plugin `docs/`; `providers/base.py`
  (the `PRProvider` protocol and provider registry); `tests/test_pr_*.py`,
  `tests/test_providers.py` (the existing pr-command test suite)
- **Supersedes / superseded by:** none

## Purpose & Intent

A registered repo's pull-request behavior — opening, reading, reviewing,
commenting on, and landing a change — should be reachable through **one
coherent, provider-neutral surface**, the same way agent-worktrees already
owns repo identity and contribution posture. Today that surface covers the
**author's** side of a PR's life (open, watch, signal merge consent, check
status, complete). A reviewer, a scenario-eval, or any other consumer that
needs to read a PR's diff/comments/threads or publish comments and verdicts
has no equivalent first-class primitive, and either goes without or embeds
its own forge-specific client — exactly the duplication agent-worktrees
exists to prevent elsewhere.

This capability's north star is **symmetry and reach**: whatever an author
can do to a PR through agent-worktrees, a reviewer should be able to observe
and respond to the same way; whatever agent-worktrees can do for a repo it
has locally checked out, an authorized caller should be able to do for a
repo it hasn't — addressing it by name and letting agent-worktrees resolve
that repo's own registered provider and policy, exactly as it already
resolves identity and contribution posture for a repo that isn't the
caller's own worktree. And because a live forge is not always available or
desirable to exercise, this capability should be **verifiable without one**:
a fabricated provider that honors the same behavioral contract as a real
one, so anything that composes the PR capability — a reviewer loop, a
clean-room scenario-eval, a dry run — can be proven against it with the same
confidence as the real thing.

## Concepts & Components

### The PR capability, as one provider-neutral surface

A `PRProvider` implementation is the unit of forge-specific integration;
everything above it — repo resolution, policy, command surface, consumer
code — is provider-agnostic. A capability this vision adds (reviewer
operations, foreign-repo addressing, a mock provider) extends the shape of
that one surface; it never becomes a second, parallel PR mechanism a
consumer has to choose between.

### Author-side and reviewer-side operations, symmetric

Author-side operations (open, watch, signal merge consent, check status,
complete, request ready) and reviewer-side operations (read the current
diff and surrounding context, read and post comments, read and resolve
threads, publish a verdict) are two faces of the same capability, not two
separate systems. A reviewer flow composes this capability exactly as an
author flow does today — it never re-implements forge commands, response
parsing, or identity resolution on its own.

### Repo addressing independent of local checkout

An authorized caller acts on a named registered repo's PR surface whether or
not that repo is checked out where the caller runs. The caller's own
worktree/anchor is never conflated with the target repo's identity: acting
"on behalf of" a foreign repo resolves that repo's own registered provider,
policy, and contribution posture from the registry, the same way
agent-worktrees already resolves a related repo's identity and posture for
purposes other than editing it locally.

### Provider conformance, real and fabricated alike

The existing pr-command test suite already exercises real provider behavior
in detail. That same suite is the natural, authoritative conformance
contract a provider must satisfy — including one built to fabricate
plausible PR state rather than call a live forge. A fabricated provider is
trustworthy exactly to the extent it is held to, and passes, the same
behavioral contract every real provider is held to; conformance is proven,
not asserted.

## Features

### reviewer-capable-provider

The PR capability supports reading a PR's current diff and surrounding code
context, reading and posting comments, reading and resolving review
threads, and publishing a verdict — as first-class provider operations, not
something a reviewer flow builds beside the capability.

### foreign-repo-pr-operations

An authorized caller can direct a PR operation at a named registered repo it
has no local checkout of. Resolution finds that repo's own registered
provider and policy; the caller's own worktree identity is never used as a
stand-in for the target's.

### conformance-verified-mock-provider

A fabricated provider exists that satisfies the same behavioral contract
(the existing pr-command test suite, extended as needed) every real provider
is held to, so a consumer can exercise realistic PR-shaped interaction —
diff review, commenting, labeling, merging — without a live forge, sanctioned
credentials, or a real PR.

### provenance-attribution-without-identifier-leakage

Opening a PR through this capability may attribute it to the originating
worktree/session, but doing so must never be the mechanism by which a
private identifier (a machine name, a raw worktree id, a session id) reaches
a public audience by default. The capability's default attribution posture
is **informationless to an outside reader** — provenance is still
traceable to an authorized operator through the capability's own records,
but a public PR body carries, at most, an opaque, non-identifying handle
rather than a raw identifier. A repo may opt in to the fuller, raw form of
attribution explicitly, and may opt out of attribution entirely — both are
deliberate, explicit configuration choices, never the unconfigured default.

## Behaviors

### one-surface-no-forking

A reviewer-side operation, a foreign-repo operation, and a mock-provider
operation all resolve through the same repo -> provider -> operation path an
author-side, local-checkout, real-provider operation already uses. None of
the three additions above introduces a second code path a consumer must
choose between.

### foreign-target-resolves-honestly

When a named target repo is not registered, or its registered provider
cannot be reached, the operation reports that plainly rather than silently
falling back to the caller's own repo/provider or guessing at the target's
identity.

### mock-fidelity-is-provable-not-assumed

Confidence that the mock provider behaves like a real one comes from it
passing the same conformance contract real providers pass — never from
manual inspection or "it looks plausible."

### mock-is-explicitly-disclosed

A consumer operating against the mock provider is told so explicitly, up
front, rather than left to infer it — consistent with the harness-side
"stay on the rails" discipline for any disclosed simulation: authoritative
for the run, not a puzzle to probe for edges.

### unconfigured-attribution-never-leaks

A repo that has not explicitly configured its attribution posture receives
the safe, non-identifying default described above — an operator who never
touches this setting never accidentally exposes a private identifier merely
by omission. A capability that persists provenance across a config change
(so an operator can later tighten or loosen a repo's policy without
retroactively exposing or hiding a marker that was already published under
a prior policy) is expected of any such tracking, not merely a suggestion.
This guarantee is forward-looking from the point such persistence exists: a
PR opened before the persistence mechanism itself existed is migrated onto
it via a one-time freeze at first touch (computing its effective policy from
whatever config is live at that single moment, then holding it fixed
exactly like every PR opened after the mechanism shipped) — not perpetually
re-derived from live config on every later touch, which would silently
reopen the exact retroactive-exposure gap this guarantee exists to close.

## Non-Goals / Boundaries

- **Not a forge UI, notification system, or webhook receiver.** This
  capability is a command/query surface, not an interactive review
  experience or an event pipeline.
- **Not a replacement for a repository's own review policy or rubric.**
  Provider-neutral operations execute policy; they do not define what a
  repository requires to approve or land a change.
- **Not a packaging decision.** Whether this capability remains part of
  agent-worktrees or is later split into its own dedicated plugin is a
  future wiring/packaging question outside this vision's scope; this vision
  describes the capability's shape independent of which module hosts it.
- **Not a specification.** This vision fixes the capability's shape and
  guarantees, not the provider protocol's exact method signatures, the mock
  provider's storage format, or a CLI flag's exact name.

## Provenance

- **2026-09-20** — Round-23 review of the `codename-attribution-by-default`
  effort (#2977) found this vision silent on the `source_attribution`/
  codename PR-marker mechanism `pr-attribution-codenames` (Done) already
  built and this effort further deepens — a genuine blind spot, not a
  vision-ahead gap. Folded back the mechanism's should-be intent (a Feature
  and a Behavior) at the detail ceiling: the public-safety
  informationless-by-default guarantee and its persistence-across-config-
  change expectation, without pinning the `source_attribution`/
  `codename_source` field names or exact config keys, which remain
  reality-doc/effort-level detail.
- **2026-09-20** — Round-32 review of the same effort found the
  persistence-across-config-change guarantee, as first worded, implicitly
  promised protection for PRs published before the persistence mechanism
  itself existed too — a promise the effort's own legacy-PR migration
  design could not keep without perpetually re-deriving from live config,
  reopening the exact gap the guarantee exists to close. Narrowed the
  guarantee to be explicitly forward-looking from the point persistence
  exists, migrated via a one-time freeze-at-first-touch rather than an
  unbounded live-config fallback — this is a clarification of the
  guarantee's boundary, not a new capability.
- **2026-09-14** — Authored from an odsp-web-harness clean-room session's
  real finding: a `code-review` scenario-eval run correctly reported a
  `noop`/BLOCKED verdict for "no PR available" rather than fabricate a
  review, which surfaced three related gaps the operator named directly: no
  mock PR provider to exercise such a flow without a real PR; the reviewer
  side of PR interaction (diffs, comments, threads, verdicts) has no
  first-class primitive the way the author side does; and PR operations
  require a local checkout of the target repo, which breaks for a repo like
  odsp-web that is worked on without one. Filed the mock-provider piece
  upstream as
  [#2691](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2691)
  before this vision existed; this vision generalizes that single issue into
  the fuller should-be shape all three gaps point at.
