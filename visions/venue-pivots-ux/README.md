# Venue Pivots UX (Codespaces & Containers) — Vision

- **Subject:** The Worktree Manager's already-registered **CodeSpaces**
  (`agent-codespaces`) and **Containers** (`agent-containers`) pivots —
  overhauled for presentation consistency with each other and with the
  Worktrees/Tasks panes, and for fidelity of the information each surfaces —
  plus the inverse direction: a Worktrees-pane row surfaces the remote
  workers that worktree supervises on those venues.
- **Scope:** leaf (concrete component; child of
  [agent-fabric](../agent-fabric/README.md), sibling of
  [picker](../picker/README.md))
- **Status:** Draft

## Purpose & Intent

**Both pivots already exist and are not greenfield.** `agent-codespaces`
contributes a genuinely rich CodeSpaces pivot: a live pool view
(`pool --picker-json`, streamed) grouped by "repo @ account", with
health/occupancy/safety columns, a claiming-worktree cross-link column, and
gated Release/Recycle/Verify actions — presentation quality already close to
the Worktrees pane's own standard. `agent-containers` contributes a Containers
pivot scoped correctly to **fleet** members only (never a general Docker
browser — `fleet --json` was already built for exactly this pivot), but at a
fraction of the CodeSpaces pivot's fidelity: a flat badge list (no columns,
no grouping, no worktree cross-link, no actions at all), even though its own
`fleet --json` output already carries a `lease` (holder) field the manifest
never wires in.

Neither pivot surfaces what its own hosted agent is actually doing: agent-bridge
already tracks a hosted session's `LiveSessionInfo`/`LiveSessionVenue` (title,
latest reported progress, liveness, the reattach target), but neither
manifest joins on it. And the CodeSpaces pivot's own `pool.py` computes a rich
`subtitle` (claim/orphaned-lock detail) that the manifest never maps into
`entry.subtitle` — a wired-but-unused field, silently dropped today.

This vision is therefore an **alignment and completion** exercise, not new
construction: bring the Containers pivot up to the Codespaces pivot's
presentation fidelity (columns, grouping, worktree cross-link, actions) using
the *same* vocabulary and column shapes so an operator reads both the same
way; wire the CodeSpaces pivot's already-computed subtitle into its manifest;
and add the one genuinely new integration both pivots are missing — the
agent-bridge live-session join — so either pivot's row shows what its remote
Copilot session is actually reporting back, not just its container/venue
lifecycle state.

The same relationship must also read **from the worktree side**. A worktree
that dispatched a task to a venue supervises that venue's remote Copilot
worker, and an operator browsing the Worktrees pane should see that worker on
the worktree's own row and act on it (inspect, message, watch, jump to the
venue) without first knowing which venue to look in. Both directions are two
views of one fact, never two separately maintained links.

## Concepts & Components

### The row grammar — columnar line one, free-form "title - activity" line two

This vision pins down a **precise row grammar** on top of the Picker's
existing two-line rendering (`RegisteredPivot.subtitle_field` +
`WorktreesView._row`/`_column_subtitle`), so every venue row — and, as
Worktrees/Tasks converge on it, every pivot's row — reads the same way:

```
[ ] <id>  STATUS  <stat1> <stat2> <stat3>  <claim, claim, ...>
  [mark] <durable subject/theme title> - <transient current activity>
```

- **Line one is columnar** — it lines up across every row in the pivot, the
  same way the Worktrees/Codespaces column tables already do: a short id, a
  palette-coloured primary status word, a handful of compact secondary
  stat badges (the venue's own key-status axes — e.g. Codespaces'
  `health`/`occupancy`/`safe`), and a claims list (prominent PR/issue refs).
  Nothing here is prose; every field is a fixed-width or fit/shrunk column,
  chosen so a operator's eye can scan straight down any one column across
  every row.
- **Line two is free-form**, not columnar, and carries exactly one
  "**title - activity**" string: an optional leading **relation/mark**
  glyph identifying what kind of thing follows (a driving-worktree link, an
  orphaned-lock warning, a live-session marker — whatever the row's most
  relevant cross-link is), then the **durable subject/theme title** — the
  stable "what is this for" (a worktree's task title, a claimed PR's title,
  the CodeSpace's own repo/branch context) — a literal `" - "` separator,
  then the **transient current activity**: the most recent thing the row's
  actual driving agent reported doing, which **may be cut** (ellipsis-
  truncated) when it doesn't fit the render width. The durable title is
  stable across many renders; the transient activity is expected to change
  turn-to-turn and is the part most likely to be truncated first when
  space is short.

This is not a new rendering mechanism — `subtitle_field` and
`_column_subtitle` already exist and already truncate to width — it is a
**content contract** for what goes into that one field: durable title,
literal `" - "`, transient activity, with an optional leading mark. Today,
Codespaces drops its subtitle entirely (see below) and Containers' subtitle
is just `image` (a durable fact, no transient activity, no mark) — neither
currently follows this grammar. Bringing both into line is this vision's
concrete row-level target.

### Where "durable title" and "transient activity" come from

Consistent with *derive-never-duplicate*, both halves of line two are read
from whichever layer already owns them, never independently authored by the
pivot (see the following three sections for the full detail on each):

- **Durable subject/theme title** — a declared checkout intent when one
  exists, else the claiming worktree's own task title (already resolved by
  the picker's `_worktree_title_map`, the same value Codespaces'
  `worktree_title` column already carries), else the venue's own stable
  identity (repo + branch, or the fleet/devcontainer spec name) as a last
  resort.
- **Transient current activity** — the most recent entry in the venue's
  accumulating snagged-signal stream: agent-bridge's live-session beat
  today, a detected auto-claimed PR or other externally-observable event as
  that capability lands; absent entirely (graceful-absence, not a
  placeholder) when nothing has been snagged yet.
- **Relation/mark** — a single glyph naming which of these signals is
  present and most relevant right now (driving-worktree link vs. an
  orphaned-lock warning vs. a live vs. idle session) — reusing whatever
  glyph vocabulary the Worktrees/Tasks panes already use for an equivalent
  distinction, not a new one invented for this pivot.

### Checkout intent vs. venue identity — <title> is declared, not derived

A CodeSpace's durable identity is its **source repo** (and branch); a
container's is its **devcontainer/fleet spec**. Both are already
first-class, line-one facts (repo grouping, `fleet` column) and stay there
— they are *what the venue is built from*, not *why it is checked out right
now*. `<title>` is a different thing: the **checkout intent** declared when
a worktree borrows/creates the venue for a purpose ("reproduce #4021 on a
clean box", "spike the new auth flow") — the same kind of intent a task's
own charter already records for a worktree. When an explicit intent exists
it is the durable title; absent one, the title falls back to the driving
worktree's own task title, and only then to the venue's bare identity
(repo/branch or fleet name) as a last resort — never conflating "what this
venue is" with "what it's for right now."

### Snagged activity — an accumulating stream, agent-bridge is one source

`<activity>` is not limited to agent-bridge's live-session beat. As a
Copilot session actually works inside a venue, the fabric already snags
values along the way — a live-session progress beat is one instance of
that, but so is a detected git push, a newly opened PR, a completed CI run,
or any other externally-observable signal the venue's own activity
produces. This vision treats the *transient activity* half of line two as
the most recent entry in that accumulating stream, however it was snagged,
not as a hardcoded read of one specific field. Phase 1 grounds it in
agent-bridge's `latest_progress` (the one source that exists today); the
PR-auto-claim capability below is the first non-agent-bridge source, and the
row should be built so a future snagged signal slots in the same way.

### Auto-claiming a PR from its own pushed branch (workspace repo / ADO)

`agent-worktrees` already has a general claim ledger keyed by worktree
(`claims_cli.py`'s `claims add <kind> <ref>`, with `pr` and `codespace`/
`container` themselves already valid claim kinds) — **claims are not a new
store this vision invents**; the row's claims-list is the *same* ledger a
Task or Worktree row already reads, joined through whichever worktree is
currently driving the venue (derive-never-duplicate, same as the
title/activity cross-links). What is genuinely new: for a workspace repo, most
Codespaces exist to push ADO topic branches that become PRs. Detecting that
a venue's own activity just produced a new PR from a pushed branch, and
auto-journaling it (`claims add pr <ref>`) on the driving worktree, means
the PR shows up in the claims-list **without** the operator or a registrar
manually claiming it — the natural, expected outcome of "I pushed a branch
from this box" becoming visible with no extra step. This is scoped to
an ADO-backed workspace flow to start; the detection mechanism (watching for
a push→PR transition) is new work, but the claim it produces rides the
existing ledger unchanged.

### Driving-worktree signal — not a boolean column; the existing `worktree` cross-link already carries it

An early draft of this vision proposed a dedicated `driven` boolean stat
column. Operator review correctly rejected it: it's a lot of real estate to
spend on a yes/no, and it's **redundant** — the pivot's existing `worktree`
cross-link column is already non-blank exactly when a worktree is driving
the venue. No second column is needed to say the same thing twice.

What *is* missing is the finer-grained signal underneath that link: is the
driving worktree's session actually **live** right now, or just present
but idle? The Worktrees pane already answers this exact question for
itself with its own compact `sess`/`live` column — a narrow (4-character),
multi-valued indicator (a pulsing "●" glyph when a mux session is live,
`PROC`/`LOCK` for other states), not a boolean. This vision's Codespaces
and Containers pivots reuse that **same column** — same key, same "live"
header, same width — rather than inventing a new one: `"LIVE"` when
agent-bridge reports an active session, `"IDLE"` when the worktree is
driving but no session is live (`IDLE` already exists in the picker's own
`state` palette), or blank when nothing is driving at all. One column, one
already-established vocabulary, reused instead of duplicated.

The row's action menu keys off the same signal: **view the driving
worktree's own Worktrees-pivot entry**, or **open its Worktree Status
card** directly — the same destination agent-dispatch's Tasks pane is
already building toward for its own embodied-task→worktree drill-in
(`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/tasks-pane-ux`'s Worktree Status card) —
offered whenever the session column reads `LIVE` or `IDLE`, omitted
entirely (graceful-absence) when it's blank.

### Codespaces: already repo-grouped; wire the dropped subtitle, add the live-session join

The CodeSpaces pivot (`pivots/agent-codespaces.json`,
`pool.picker_payload`) already gets most of this right: entries are grouped
by "repo @ account" (repo-first identity), a compact RUNNING/STALE/STOPPED
status carries the palette, `health`/`occupancy`/`safe` columns carry
`agent-codespaces`' own lifecycle vocabulary, a `worktree` column already
cross-links to the claiming local worktree (resolved to that worktree's task
title via the picker's own `_worktree_title_map`), and Release/Recycle/Verify
actions are gated on disposition/safety. Two real gaps remain:

- **The dropped subtitle, and the missing "- activity" half.**
  `picker_payload` computes a `subtitle` (claim holder, cross-machine hold,
  orphaned-lock warning) on every entry, but the manifest's `entry` mapping
  never declares `"subtitle"`, so `subtitle_field` stays unset and the
  computed line is silently never rendered — a one-line manifest fix
  restores the **durable-title** half of line two. It still needs the
  **transient-activity** half appended (see next point) to fully match the
  row grammar's `"<title> - <activity>"` shape, not just the title alone.
- **No remote-session join.** Nothing today reads agent-bridge's
  `LiveSessionInfo`/`LiveSessionVenue` for a CodeSpace-hosted session. Where
  agent-bridge has a live registration keyed by `venue.kind == "codespace"`
  and `venue.target` matching this entry, the row's line two gains its
  `" - "` and transient-activity half from what agent-bridge already
  receives back: the session's latest reported progress/intent — genuinely
  new information, not a duplication of the existing worktree/task-title
  cross-link, which stays the durable-title half.

### Containers: bring to Codespaces' fidelity; same live-session join

The Containers pivot (`pivots/agent-containers.json`, `_cmd_fleet`) is
already correctly scoped to **fleet** members only — `fleet --json` was
purpose-built for this pivot and was never a general Docker-container
browser needing narrowing. But its manifest is far thinner than its
Codespaces sibling: a flat badge list (`id`/`title`/`subtitle`=image,
badges=[state, fleet]) with no `columns`, no `group`, no worktree
cross-link, and **zero actions** — even though `fleet --json` already emits
a `lease` field (the holding effort/worktree, the direct analogue of
Codespaces' `holder`/`worktree`) that the manifest never maps in. Bringing
this pivot to parity means:

- Declaring `columns` mirroring Codespaces' shape (container/fleet, state,
  lease→worktree, and whatever `security_profile`/`network` signal is
  genuinely picker-worthy) instead of the current bare badge list.
  Grouping by fleet (the container analogue of "repo @ account").
  Wiring `lease` to a `worktree` cross-link the same way Codespaces already
  does — giving line two a real **durable title** (today's subtitle is
  just `image`, a durable fact with no title/activity structure at all).
- Adding gated actions analogous to Release/Recycle/Verify — a container
  fleet member's own lifecycle (`lifecycle.py`, `lease.py`, `rescue.py`
  already model start/stop/remove/rescue) deserves the same menu treatment
  Codespaces already has, not a read-only list.
- The same agent-bridge live-session join as Codespaces, keyed by
  `venue.kind == "container"` and `venue.target`, supplying line two's
  **transient-activity** half exactly as it does for Codespaces.

Both pivots converge on one shared column vocabulary and lifecycle-state
palette so an operator reads a CodeSpace row and a fleet-container row the
same way, differing only in the fields each venue actually has (e.g.
`cores` for Codespaces, `security_profile` for Containers).

### Claims — one ledger, read through the driving-worktree cross-link

Claims are **not a new store this vision invents**: `agent-worktrees`
already journals a per-worktree claim ledger (`claims_cli.py`'s
`claims add <kind> <ref>`), with `pr` and `codespace`/`container`
themselves already valid claim kinds. The row's claims-list is that same
ledger, read through whichever worktree is currently driving the venue —
the identical derive-never-duplicate cross-link that resolves the durable
title, not a second claims rendering. A CodeSpace or fleet container with
no driving worktree simply has no claims to show (graceful-absence); one
with a driving worktree shows exactly what that worktree's own ledger
already carries, the "1-2 prominent inline, full graph on drill-in"
convention the Tasks pane's Prominent-Artifacts feature already
established. See "Auto-claiming a PR" above for the one new *producer* of
claim entries this vision adds — the ledger and its rendering are unchanged.

### Claims pecking order — one shared prominence ranking, everywhere

A worktree's claim ledger can carry several entries at once (a PR, an
issue, a claimed CodeSpace, a child worktree...), but line one's claims
slot only has room for the "1-2 prominent" the existing Tasks-pane
convention already limits itself to — so *something* has to decide which
1-2 win. This vision fixes that as one **shared prominence ranking**,
usable identically by every pivot that shows a claims-list (Worktrees,
Tasks, Codespaces, Containers), not a value each pivot picks for itself.
The ranking's organizing principle is **human-mappable, quick-find first**:
an entity a human can recognize and act on by its own external identity
(a PR number, a bug number) outranks one that is only ever meaningful
inside the fabric itself. Starting order (operator-supplied, expected to be
tuned as real usage surfaces exceptions):

1. Active PR
2. Active bug/issue
3. Active effort
4. Active bridge (agent-bridge agent/session)
5. Active CodeSpace/Container
6. Active child worktree
7. Active machine SSH session
8. Active dispatch task

Dispatch tasks rank last deliberately: a task id is essentially never an
independently-referenceable identity outside this fabric the way a PR or
bug number is, so even an active one is the least "human-mappable, quick
find" thing to lead with. This is a **starting, explicitly tunable**
ordering, not a frozen spec — the value this vision adds is fixing that
exactly one such list exists and is shared, not the specific order of any
one entry.

**Implemented (2026-09-21):** `agent_worktrees.claims_rank`
(`rank_claims`/`format_claim`/`summarize_claims`) is the real module —
pure functions over `ResourceClaim`-shaped entries (objects or plain
dicts), no I/O, fully unit-tested (`tests/test_claims_rank.py`). Grounded
against the real claim-kind vocabulary while building it:
`claims_cli._claims_add`'s `valid_kinds` today is only
`{worktree, codespace, container, ssh, workdir, pr, task}` — "bug"/
"issue", "effort", and "bridge" are **not yet claimable kinds** at all. The
module ranks whatever kind is actually present in a ledger (so it degrades
gracefully today, showing only PR/CodeSpace/container/worktree/task
claims); adding a "bug"/"issue" claim kind is the workspace-PR auto-claim
concept's own prerequisite, not something this module does on its own.

### Claim-kind extensibility — a `.d/` drop-in registry, mirroring pivots

The pecking order's tiers name kinds this repo cannot yet produce a claim
for at all (bug/issue, effort, bridge). Rather than hardcoding every future
kind into `claims_rank`'s own table as each becomes claimable, this vision
adopts the **same cross-plugin contribution pattern the Picker's own pivot
system already uses**: a plugin drops one small file declaring what it
contributes, a discovery layer finds every installed plugin's drop-ins, and
every consumer picks up the merged result identically — no plugin ever
edits another plugin's file, and no consumer hardcodes a fixed plugin list.

Concretely (implemented, 2026-09-21):
`agent_worktrees.claim_kinds_registry` scans every installed plugin's own
`<plugin_root>/claim-kinds/*.json` (`{"kind", "priority", "label"?}`) and
merges the contributions onto `claims_rank.DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER` — a
plugin can override an existing tier's priority or declare a brand-new
kind, and `claims_rank` itself never scans a filesystem to find out (stays
pure; the registry module does the I/O and hands it a plain mapping). This
is a **deliberately lighter** drop-in contract than the pivot registry's
own — no identity verification, no legacy-manifest migration, no separate
materialized-runtime-directory step — because a claim-kind declaration
carries no executable command to spoof; that machinery's entire reason to
exist doesn't apply to a bare priority integer and an optional label.

The practical payoff: when a future plugin (or this vision's own workspace
PR auto-claim work) needs a `bug`/`issue` claim kind to actually exist, it
does not touch `claims_rank.py` at all — it ships its own
`claim-kinds/bug.json` declaring the kind, its priority, and how it should
be labeled ("bug"), and every claims-showing pivot picks it up identically
the next time it resolves the effective pecking order.

### Open — into the muxed Copilot instance, over SSH

The single most important action on either pivot is **Open**: for a row that
already has a live or resumable agent-bridge session, Open attaches the
operator into that session's muxed Copilot instance over the fabric's SSH
transport — the same reattach mechanics `LiveSessionVenue.mux_session_name`
already exists to support, and the natural landing point for the parallel
**drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH** capability. Opening a row is meant to feel
identical whether the venue is a CodeSpace, a fleet container, or (today) a
local worktree — the operator picks *what* to open, not *how* the transport
works. Neither pivot has this action today (Codespaces' current actions are
Release/Recycle/Verify only; Containers has none), so this is genuinely new
for both, not a realignment of something existing.

### New codespace / New container — provision, then embody

A dormant pivot (no CodeSpaces or fleet containers exist yet, or the operator
wants another) offers **New codespace**/**New container**, prompting for the
target repo/devcontainer spec and any other required target info, then
provisioning the venue and handing the operator directly into a fresh Copilot
session inside it — the same eventual destination as **Open** on an existing
row, just preceded by a provisioning step. This is deliberately the same flow
an operator reaches by doing **New agent** against a dormant/idle venue: both
paths converge on "provision or select a venue, then embody a Copilot
session into it."

### Supervised workers, seen from the worktree row

The inverse of the driving-worktree cross-link. A worktree that dispatched a
task to a CodeSpace, fleet container, or SSH host supervises that venue's
remote Copilot worker, and the **Worktrees-pane row** for that worktree
surfaces it using the same row grammar and vocabulary the venue pivots use:
a relation mark naming a supervised remote worker, the venue's identity, the
same `LIVE`/`IDLE` session signal, and the worker's latest snagged activity
as the transient half of line two. A worktree supervising more than one
worker shows them compactly on its row and fully on drill-in, following the
"1-2 prominent inline" convention the claims-list already uses.

The link is **derived, not recorded**: it comes from the worktree's own
outbound venue claims (the claim ledger already journals the venue a
worktree connected to) joined with agent-bridge's live sessions by venue
identity. It is the same pair of facts the venue pivot reads in the other
direction, so the two views always agree, including when a venue was
borrowed under an explicit effort or owner name rather than the worktree's
own identity.

The row's action menu offers, for each supervised worker:

- **Inspect** — attach to the worker's interactive session in a **new**
  terminal window or tab, leaving the Picker where it was;
- **Send message** — steer the worker's running turn with operator-typed
  text, with an explicit choice to interrupt instead;
- **Watch** — open agent-bridge's live-session web view for that worker;
- **Show venue** — jump to the venue's own row in its pivot.

Each venue provider contributes these actions for its own venue kind, the
same way it contributes its pivot, so the Picker itself stays
provider-neutral and a new venue kind gains the worktree-side view by
contributing, not by the Picker learning about it.

## Features

### row-grammar-consistency
Line one of every Codespaces/Containers row is columnar
(id/status/key-status/claims); line two carries exactly one
`"<mark> <durable title> - <transient activity>"` string. Codespaces gets
its already-computed durable title restored (currently dropped) and gains
the transient-activity half for the first time; Containers gains both
halves for the first time (today's subtitle is a bare `image` fact with
neither title nor activity structure).

### codespaces-pivot-parity
The CodeSpaces pivot keeps its existing repo-grouped, columnar,
action-gated shape, with its dropped `subtitle` wired in and a new
agent-bridge live-session join (title, latest progress/intent, liveness)
surfaced inline.

### containers-pivot-parity
The Containers pivot — already correctly scoped to fleet members only — gains
the columns, fleet-grouping, worktree/lease cross-link, gated lifecycle
actions, and agent-bridge live-session join needed to match the CodeSpaces
pivot's presentation fidelity, using the same shared column vocabulary and
lifecycle palette.

### driving-worktree-session-and-nav
No separate "driven" boolean column — the existing `worktree` cross-link
already signals that. A narrow, multi-valued session column (reusing the
Worktrees pane's own `sess`/`live` column: `LIVE`/`IDLE`/blank) carries the
finer-grained liveness signal underneath it. The row's action menu gains
"view driving worktree" (jump to its Worktrees-pivot entry) and "worktree
status" (open its Worktree Status card directly), offered whenever that
column reads `LIVE` or `IDLE` — new on both pivots, mirroring
agent-dispatch's own Tasks→Worktree drill-in direction.

### codespace-pr-auto-claim
For an ADO-backed workspace flow, a CodeSpace's own pushed topic branch that
becomes a PR is auto-journaled (`agent-worktrees claims add pr <ref>`) onto
the driving worktree's existing claim ledger — no manual claim step, no new
claim store, just a new producer feeding the ledger the claims-list column
already reads.

### claims-pecking-order
Every pivot showing a claims-list (Worktrees, Tasks, Codespaces,
Containers) selects its "1-2 prominent" entries from one shared
prominence ranking (PR > bug/issue > effort > bridge > CodeSpace/container
> child worktree > machine SSH > dispatch task, tunable), not a
per-pivot ad hoc choice.

### claim-kind-dropin-registry
Any installed plugin can contribute a new claimable kind (and its
pecking-order priority/label) via a `claim-kinds/*.json` drop-in, mirroring
the Picker's own pivot-contribution pattern — no consuming pivot or the
ranking module itself hardcodes a fixed plugin list.

### open-into-muxed-session
A new **Open** action on either pivot attaches the operator to a live row's
muxed Copilot instance over the fabric's SSH transport, regardless of
whether the venue is a CodeSpace or a fleet container — neither pivot has
this today.

### new-venue-then-embody
"New codespace" and "New container" (and "New agent" against a dormant
venue) provision the target venue from the information the operator
provides, then carry the operator directly into a newly embodied Copilot
session in that venue — one continuous flow, not a provisioning step
followed by a separate manual attach.

### worktree-row-supervised-workers
A Worktrees-pane row shows the remote worker(s) its worktree supervises —
venue, `LIVE`/`IDLE`, and latest activity — derived from the worktree's
outbound venue claims joined with agent-bridge live sessions, in the same
row grammar the venue pivots use.

### supervised-worker-actions
Each supervised worker on a worktree row offers Inspect (attach in a new
terminal window/tab), Send message (steer, or interrupt), Watch (live-session
web view), and Show venue (jump to the venue's pivot row), contributed by the
venue's own provider.

## Behaviors

### derive-never-duplicate
Every field a Codespaces/Containers row shows is read from its owning
layer — `agent-codespaces`/`agent-containers` for venue identity and
lifecycle, `agent-worktrees` for the driving-worktree cross-link,
agent-bridge for live-session state — never independently tracked or
cached as a second copy inside the pivot itself.

### one-ranking-many-consumers
The claims pecking order is defined **once**, in one place a claim-showing
pivot's rendering code calls into (not copy-pasted per pivot and not
recomputed differently by Worktrees vs. Tasks vs. Codespaces vs.
Containers). Tuning the order is a single-point change that every
consuming pivot picks up identically.

### graceful-absence
A venue with no live agent-bridge session, no driving worktree, or no
claims renders its row with those fields simply omitted — never an error,
a stale value, or a blocked pivot load. A pivot with zero venues (no
CodeSpaces provisioned, no fleet yet built) renders an empty-state hint
with the New-venue action, matching the existing pivot-registry contract's
"a bad or absent pivot simply doesn't appear" defensiveness. When only one
half of line two's `"<title> - <activity>"` is available (a durable title
with no live session, or — never expected, but degrade the same way if it
occurs — activity with no resolvable title), the row shows that half alone
rather than a dangling `" - "` separator or a placeholder for the missing
half.

### transient-truncates-first
When line two doesn't fit the render width, the **transient activity**
half is truncated (ellipsis) before the durable title is touched — the
title is the stable fact an operator relies on to recognize the row across
renders; the activity is already expected to change turn-to-turn and is
the cheaper thing to lose first. The leading relation/mark glyph is never
dropped for width; it is the cheapest, most information-dense element on
the line.

### preview-before-implement
Every visual iteration on either pivot's row/menu/empty-state design is
validated as a **real, driven screenshot** of the actual Textual engine
(reusing the `picker-snapshot`/`tasks-preview` pattern) against a hermetic
demo data source, before any implementation PR — never a hand-drawn mockup.

### both-directions-agree
A venue row's driving-worktree link and a worktree row's supervised-worker
link are two readings of the same claim-plus-live-session facts. They never
disagree, and neither depends on the venue having been borrowed under the
worktree's own identity rather than an explicit effort or owner name.

### render-without-reaching-the-venue
Showing supervised workers on worktree rows reads only host-local state
(the claim ledger and agent-bridge's live-session registry); rendering the
Worktrees pane never opens a connection to a venue. When agent-bridge is
unreachable, the worker line is simply absent (graceful-absence).

### inspect-never-displaces-the-picker
Inspect opens the worker's session alongside the Picker, in a new terminal
window or tab, rather than replacing the Picker's own terminal.

## Non-Goals / Boundaries

- **Not a general Docker browser.** The Containers pivot already correctly
  scopes to fleet members only (`fleet --json` was purpose-built for it);
  this vision does not change that scope or attempt to surface every
  container on the host.
- **Not a new venue-lifecycle owner.** This vision adds presentation, a
  live-session join, and a provisioning entry point; it does not change how
  `agent-codespaces` or `agent-containers` themselves provision, lease, or
  reclaim venues.
- **Not a new live-session protocol.** Remote session state is read from
  whatever agent-bridge already receives back from a hosted session
  (`LiveSessionInfo`); this vision does not extend what agent-bridge itself
  collects or how a hosted session reports back.
- **Not a new row-rendering mechanism.** The two-line/columnar row grammar
  already exists generically (`subtitle_field`, `Column`); this vision uses
  it consistently rather than building a new renderer.
- **Not a new claim store or claim-rendering surface.** The claims-list
  reads `agent-worktrees`' existing per-worktree claim ledger through the
  driving-worktree cross-link; this vision adds one new *producer* (the
  workspace-repo PR auto-claim) but no new storage or rendering path.
- **Not a general ADO/CI event pipeline.** PR auto-claiming is scoped to
  the specific push→PR transition an ADO-backed workspace flow produces; this vision
  does not attempt to generalize to every possible externally-observable
  signal a venue could produce.
- **Not sole authority over the claims pecking order elsewhere.** This
  vision proposes and consumes the shared ranking, but the Worktrees and
  Tasks panes' own prominent-artifact selection predates it
  (`plugins/agent-dispatch/tasks-pane-ux`'s Prominent Artifacts feature) —
  aligning those panes onto this ranking is a cross-vision coordination
  item, not something this vision can unilaterally mandate onto another
  plugin's owned surface.
- **Not a transcript viewer.** A worktree row shows a supervised worker's
  latest activity only; reading the worker's conversation is what Inspect
  and Watch are for.
- **Not handoff continuity.** Carrying a supervised worker across a context
  handoff to a successor session belongs to the session-continuity surfaces,
  not to this pivot vision.

## Provenance

- **2026-09-25** — Operator asked for the inverse of the venue → worktree
  direction: a worktree row should show the remote worker it supervises
  (detached, interactive venue sessions dispatched from a host worktree) and
  offer Inspect / Send message / Watch / Show venue. Added as the
  "Supervised workers, seen from the worktree row" concept, two features, and
  three behaviors; grounded against the existing outbound claim journaling on
  connect and agent-bridge's venue-keyed live sessions (tracked in #3657).

- **2026-09-21 (latest+4)** — Operator proposed a `.d/` drop-in system for
  claim-kind metadata, mirroring the Picker's own pivot-contribution
  pattern, so any plugin can declare a new claimable kind + priority
  without editing `claims_rank.py`. Implemented as
  `agent_worktrees.claim_kinds_registry` (scans installed plugins'
  `claim-kinds/*.json`, merges onto `claims_rank.DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER`),
  with `claims_rank` itself gaining an optional `pecking_order=`/
  `label_overrides=` parameter so it stays pure/I/O-free while still
  consuming plugin contributions. 12 new tests, all passing (28 total
  across both modules). Added as the "Claim-kind extensibility" concept
  and `claim-kind-dropin-registry` feature.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+3)** — Implemented the shared claims-pecking-order
  module for real: `agent_worktrees.claims_rank` (pure functions over
  `ResourceClaim`-shaped entries, 13 passing unit tests). Grounded against
  the real claim-kind vocabulary while building it — `bug`/`issue`,
  `effort`, and `bridge` are not yet claimable kinds in `claims_cli`'s own
  `valid_kinds` — recorded as an explicit gap the module degrades
  gracefully around rather than papering over.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+2)** — Operator reviewed the rendered screenshots and
  flagged the `driven` column as too much real estate for a boolean,
  pointing at the Worktrees pane's own compact, multi-valued `sess`/`live`
  column as the right model. Dropped `driven` entirely (redundant with the
  already-present `worktree` cross-link column) and replaced it with that
  same narrow session column (`LIVE`/`IDLE`/blank), reusing its exact
  key/header/width rather than inventing a new indicator.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+1)** — Operator supplied a cross-pivot claims
  prominence ranking (PR > bug > effort > bridge > CodeSpace/container >
  child worktree > machine SSH > dispatch task — human-mappable/
  quick-find first, dispatch tasks penalized for lacking an externally
  referenceable id), explicitly tunable. Added as a shared "Claims pecking
  order" concept and `one-ranking-many-consumers` behavior; flagged as a
  cross-vision coordination item with `plugins/agent-dispatch/
  tasks-pane-ux`'s own pre-existing Prominent Artifacts feature rather than
  something this vision can unilaterally mandate there.
- **2026-09-21 (latest)** — Operator refined the title/activity model:
  `<title>` is a declared checkout intent, distinct from the venue's own
  repo/spec identity (already line one); `<activity>` is an accumulating
  "snagged" signal stream, not limited to agent-bridge. Added the
  workspace-repo PR auto-claim capability (a CodeSpace's own pushed ADO branch
  auto-journals its resulting PR onto the driving worktree's existing
  claim ledger — clarified that claims are that same existing
  `agent-worktrees` ledger, not a new store) and a reserved
  driving-worktree mark/navigation slot (view the driving worktree, or its
  Worktree Status card, mirroring agent-dispatch's own direction).
- **2026-09-21 (later)** — Operator specified the precise row grammar:
  columnar line one, free-form `"[mark] <durable title> - <transient
  activity>"` line two, with the activity (not the title) the first thing
  truncated. Added as the "Row grammar" concept and threaded through the
  Codespaces/Containers sections and a new `transient-truncates-first`
  behavior.
- **2026-09-21** — Conceived from an operator request to overhaul the
  under-served Codespaces/Containers pivots. Initially drafted as if
  neither pivot existed; corrected after re-grounding against the real
  `pivots/agent-codespaces.json`/`pivots/agent-containers.json` manifests
  and `pool.py`/`_cmd_fleet` source, which show both pivots already
  registered but asymmetric in fidelity (Codespaces rich/columnar,
  Containers thin/badge-only) — reframed as an alignment + completion
  effort (parity, dropped-field fixes, the missing agent-bridge
  live-session join) rather than new construction.
