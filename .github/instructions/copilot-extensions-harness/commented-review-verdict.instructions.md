# Commented-verdict review fallback

**Fallback policy `[owner: copilot-extensions-harness]`:** **Before applying
anything below, check the repo you're actually operating in for its own
explicit review-gating policy** (its `AGENTS.md`/contribution docs) --
if one exists, follow that instead; this is only a default for repos with
no such policy of their own. A PR review whose verdict is a plain
**comment** (not an approval or a change-request) is not automatically a
stuck or ambiguous state on hosts with no stricter policy -- it can be
Copilot's normal non-blocking review shape (a `COMMENTED` state never gates
a merge where the ruleset requires zero approving reviews). Absent a
repo-specific override, read its findings as advisory: address genuinely
valuable ones, explain or dismiss the rest, and land the change -- do not
wait for some further verdict that was never going to arrive, and do not
re-request review in a loop chasing a clean pass.
