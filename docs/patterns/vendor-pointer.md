# Pattern: vendor pointers

**Serves:** `docs/install-contract.md`'s self-contained shipped-payload guarantee.
**Exemplars:** file-pointer doc mirrors (`plugins/*/docs/entity-relationship-model.md`),
`agent-worktrees`'s `lazy-cli-dispatch` lib reference, `agent-pull-requests`'s
installer-engine reference, and `agent-worktrees`' packaged launch-wrapper
fallback assets.

## Problem

Several surfaces in this repo want the same thing at once:

- **one canonical source on `dev`** so a contributor edits one place and cannot
  drift a hand-copied duplicate; and
- a **fully self-contained shipped payload** on `main`, because a marketplace
  plugin installs independently and cannot depend on a sibling checkout at
  install or runtime.

The pattern is to keep `dev` DRY, then let promotion rebuild the shipped copy.

## Standard approach

Use one of **two** dev-time forms, chosen by whether the consumer must stay
*runnable on `dev`* or can be a *human-readable stub* there:

| Kind | Use when | `dev` form | Promotion-time action | Shipped `main` form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **File pointer** | A mirrored file is read by humans/agents, not executed as code on `dev` | A short physical stub file whose first line is `<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=<repo-relative-path> kind=file -->` | Copy canonical file bytes over the stub in place | A normal full file |
| **Canonical reference** | The consumer must still run, test, and install from `dev` | A live relative-path reference back to canonical, with **no local vendored copy at all** | Copy canonical content into the consumer and rewrite the reference to the local shipped form | A normal full local copy |

Both kinds share one lifecycle:

1. **Author on `dev` against canonical.**
2. **Promotion/preview materializes** a self-contained tree by copying canonical
   content into the consumer and rewriting any live references that would not
   resolve outside the monorepo.
3. **`main` ships only materialized content.** No external path escape, no
   `editable = true`, no dependency on a sibling plugin or checkout.

## Kind 1: file pointers

File pointers are for mirrored payload files whose `dev`-branch copy does not
need to execute. The pointer is the file itself, not a sidecar:

```md
<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md kind=file -->
```

The stub exists physically on `dev`, which makes the duplication obvious to a
reader opening the mirror. Promotion then overwrites that stub with the
canonical file's bytes.

### When to use it

- mirrored docs under `plugins/*/docs/`
- other payload files where a short stub is acceptable on `dev`

### When not to use it

- Python libs or installer/runtime scripts that must still execute from the
  `dev` checkout

## Kind 2: canonical references

Canonical references keep `dev` runnable while still removing the local copy.
This repo currently uses two concrete forms.

### Shared Python libs: `uv`-editable references

The consumer's `pyproject.toml` points straight at canonical `libs/<lib>` with
`editable = true`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
agent-lazy-cli-dispatch = { path = "../../libs/lazy-cli-dispatch", editable = true }
```

On `dev`, `uv` resolves imports live from canonical. Promotion then:

1. copies canonical `libs/<lib>/` into the consumer's own `libs/<lib>/`, and
2. rewrites the source entry back to the shipped local form:

```toml
agent-lazy-cli-dispatch = { path = "libs/lazy-cli-dispatch" }
```

### Shared installer engine: direct source reference

For installer wrappers, the live reference is the source line itself. On `dev`,
the wrapper sources canonical `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}`
directly and carries **no plugin-local `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy**.

Promotion restores the local shipped form by copying canonical back into
`scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` and rewriting the wrapper's source line to
the local path.

### Packaged launch-wrapper assets: manifest-driven materialization

`agent-worktrees`' Python-only packaged fallback installer deploys launch
wrappers from its own payload `bin/` tree, but the canonical sources live under
`worktree-manager/bin/` on `dev`. Instead of carrying a second editable copy in
the plugin tree, `plugins/agent-worktrees/launch-wrapper-assets.json` names the
authoritative source directory plus the exact files the packaged fallback
requires. Promotion and preview copy those files into
`plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/`, yielding the same shipped self-contained payload
contract as the other canonical-reference forms.

The runtime installer prefers those packaged copies when present; a live `dev`
checkout may still fall back to the canonical `worktree-manager/bin/` source so
local non-packaged install paths remain runnable while authoring.

## Tool ownership: who enforces which invariant

| Concern | Owner | Invariant it owns |
|---|---|---|
| Whole-repo materialization | `tools/materialize_main.py` | Expands file pointers, `uv`-editable lib references, and installer-engine references into a self-contained snapshot; refuses missing/escaping/symlinked canonical inputs |
| Fail-closed release orchestration | `tools/promote_release.py` | Treats an unresolved materialization result as release-blocking instead of shipping a partial `main` snapshot |
| Single-plugin local preview | `tools/preview_release.py` | Performs the same copy-and-rewrite into a preview copy, never the real checkout |
| Shared-lib conversion and dev-time checks | `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py` | Converts copies to the `uv`-editable form (`--uv-editable`), restores/promotes canonicals, and validates canonical-vs-copy/reference state in `--check` |
| Shared-lib parsing / rewrite helpers | `tools/uv_editable_ref.py` | Shared definition of "this `[tool.uv.sources]` entry escapes the consumer root and is therefore a canonical reference", plus table-span and tree-comparison helpers reused by sync + promotion |
| Remaining real-copy shared-lib drift | `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` | Keeps the still-vendored multi-copy `src/` + version surfaces in sync with each other; once a consumer has **no local copy**, that consumer naturally falls out of this guard |
| Installer-engine adoption and drift | `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` | Verifies each adopter is in exactly one valid dev-time form: local vendored copy or canonical reference |
| Installer-engine parsing / rewrite helpers | `tools/installer_engine_ref.py` | Shared definition of the canonical-vs-local installer-engine source-line forms reused by sync + promotion |
| Release attribution | `tools/check-version-bump.py` + `tools/check-changefile-presence.py` | A canonical-source change must still charge the affected shipped consumers (including `uv`-editable lib consumers and registered installer-engine adopters) and carry the changefile intent that lets promotion publish it |
| Install-contract enforcement | `tools/check-install-contract.py` | Fails if the install contract is broken and delegates installer-engine conformance to `sync-installer-engine.py`'s `verify()` |

## Adopting the pattern

### Add a new file pointer

1. Keep one authoritative source file in its canonical location.
2. Replace each vendored mirror with a stub file whose first line is the
   `VENDOR_POINTER` HTML comment marker pointing at the canonical path.
3. Validate the materialized output (`tools/materialize_main.py` and, for a
   plugin payload, `tools/preview_release.py`) before publishing.

Reference example: the `entity-relationship-model.md` mirrors converted by the
`vendored-doc-pointers` effort (`efforts/2026/09/26 vendored-doc-pointers/README.md`).

### Add a new shared-lib canonical reference

1. Make sure `libs/<lib>/` is the canonical copy and that you are not about to
   discard a consumer-local delta.
2. Convert each consumer with:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable <consumer> <lib>
   ```

3. If the lib itself depends on another vendored lib, ensure that nested
   dependency is also expressed canonically and carries `editable = true`.
4. Audit any consumer-local fallback/install/test paths that hardcode
   `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>` and update them if they must still work from a
   `dev` checkout with no local copy.
5. Re-run the repo guards.

Reference example: `agent-worktrees`'s `agent-lazy-cli-dispatch` entry in
`plugins/agent-worktrees/pyproject.toml`.

### Add a new installer-engine canonical reference

1. Delete the adopter's local `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` copies.
2. Rewrite `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` to source canonical
   `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly.
3. Register the plugin in `tools/installer_engine_ref.py`'s `ADOPTERS` list so
   the guard and the promotion materializer both know this plugin is expected to
   use the canonical-reference form.
4. Verify both language variants with `python3 tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check`
   and `python3 tools/check-install-contract.py`.
5. Confirm promotion/preview rewrite the adopter back to the local shipped form.

Reference example: `plugins/agent-pull-requests/scripts/install.{sh,ps1}`.

## What is *not* the current adoption path

`src-passthrough` `VENDOR_POINTER.json` directory pointers are retired. New
and existing work should use the file-pointer form or the canonical-reference
form above; no live repo consumer still depends on the older directory-pointer
mechanism.
