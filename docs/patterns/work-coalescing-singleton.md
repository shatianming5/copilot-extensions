## The problem

Several plugins independently face the identical shape: **many short-lived
callers each recompute or re-request the same cheap, idempotent, shareable
work**, one full-price execution per caller, with no way for one caller's
answer to help the next:

- `agent-worktrees` — every `list --json --classify` invocation (Picker
  polling, a hook, a plain CLI call) independently re-runs `scan_sessions_fast`,
  git classification, mux queries, and the bare-orphan scan.
- `agent-mcp` — today's optional serve tier spawns **one heavy stdio bridge
  process per session per server**; a host with several sessions sharing one
  MCP server config pays that cost once per session instead of once per
  server (dozens of processes observed for a couple of shared servers — the
  dominant process-count/memory multiplier named in #744).

Both are the same caller shape from `hooks-and-callbacks-are-transient`: a
repeated, on-demand caller of a cheap, idempotent answer should reach a
resident singleton as a thin, ref-counted subscriber — booting it on demand
if none is reachable — rather than compute (or run a heavyweight process)
independently every time. This pattern names that reusable shape once, so it
is built as a shared helper instead of re-invented per plugin.

## The shape (non-negotiable invariants)

1. **Coalesce, don't fan out.** Identical requests arriving close together
   collapse onto one in-flight execution (or one shared warm process); the
   daemon never spawns a second worker for the same key while one is live.
2. **Distinct work is queued, never unbounded-forked.** Side-effecting or
   per-identity work (a distinct MCP server session, a distinct classify key)
   gets bounded concurrency and backpressure, not one thread/process per
   caller.
3. **Refcounted, idle-exit.** The daemon exists only while at least one
   subscriber needs it. Active subscriber count is an **explicit** signal
   (register on connect, release on disconnect/exit), not inferred from a
   fixed timer alone; the daemon lingers a bounded grace period after the
   last release, then exits. It is **warmth, not truth** — losing it costs
   only recomputation, never data.
4. **Always optional, with a correct inline fallback.** A lone caller, or any
   caller that cannot reach the daemon within its own bounded wait, computes
   the answer itself (or runs the direct-bridge path) — the exact behavior
   this pattern must never regress under any timeout or crash. **Narrow,
   named exception:** a caller operating under its own separately
   documented, subprocess-free contract (e.g. a render loop or click
   handler that is itself forbidden from spawning work — see
   `agent-worktrees`' `external-status-consumer-contract`) has no inline
   fallback available to it by construction. Such a caller reports the
   requested facts as stale/unknown instead — a degraded result, not a
   silent substitute for the inline fallback — and this exception applies
   only where that caller's own contract already forbids the subprocess
   or in-process computation an inline fallback would require, never as a
   general opt-out from this invariant.
5. **Only across callers that share identity and credentials.** The daemon
   consolidates the **warm runtime and shared upstream connection**, never a
   caller's private state; agent-mcp must never pool a server instance
   across two callers with different credentials for that server.
6. **Guarded and discovered by the existing primitives**, not new ones: the
   `single-instance-lease` bounds the daemon to one live instance per
   installation cell; `zdd` (or the daemon's own generation token) makes an
   update to the daemon itself a graceful cutover, not a stop-the-world
   restart; rendezvous (a published endpoint file, liveness-checked) is how a
   client finds it — never by spawning one "to make sure."

## The wire protocol (generalizing `hook_ipc.py`)

`agent-worktrees`' `HookIpcServer`/`_Handler` already implements the core
shape for one call kind (`session-lifecycle-v1`): a dynamic-port, loopback-only,
token-authed `ThreadingTCPServer`, one JSON request-per-line in, one JSON
response-per-line out, a server-side deadline the client sets per request. The
reusable helper generalizes it to any request `kind`, not just hook decisions,
and adds the ref-counted subscriber lifecycle `hook_ipc.py` does not yet need:

```

Request/response envelopes stay the existing `hook_ipc.py` shape
(`{"version": 1, "token": ..., "kind": ..., "payload": ..., "deadline": ...}`
in; `{"version": 1, "result": ...}` or `{"version": 1, "fallback": true}` out)
so the daemon can serve both the existing hook-decision kind and new
coalescing kinds over one listener. `SUBSCRIBE`/implicit-release is additive:
a caller that never subscribes (today's one-shot hook decision) behaves
exactly as it does today — refcounting is opt-in per request kind, not a
breaking change to the existing protocol.

## Timeout budgets (two very different cost profiles, one shape)

`hook_ipc._READ_TIMEOUT_S = 1.0` is calibrated for a hot-path hook decision.
The reusable helper must **not** hard-code one budget — a cold classify pass
or a cold MCP server boot is seconds, not ~1s, and forcing a single fixed
timeout would either make the hot path sluggish or make a cold caller give up
too early. Each consumer's client declares its own two-phase budget:

| Phase | What it bounds | Reference value |
|---|---|---|
| **Boot-wait** | Time a first caller (no daemon reachable) waits for a freshly-spawned daemon to publish its rendezvous endpoint and accept a subscribe. | Resident classify daemon: several seconds (cold git classification). MCP multiplexer: bounded by the slowest server's own cold-start (server-declared, or a conservative shared default) — never open-ended. |
| **Request-deadline** | Time a single in-flight request may take before the client gives up on the daemon and takes the fallback path. Carried per-request (existing `deadline` field), so a slow individual request degrades that one caller, not every subscriber. | Hot hook decision: ~1s (unchanged). Classify/list: a few seconds. MCP request: the server's own call semantics — the multiplexer forwards, it does not impose a new ceiling beyond what a direct (unpooled) call would already have. |

A caller whose boot-wait **or** request-deadline expires falls back to its
existing direct/inline path (live computation, or the existing one-bridge-
per-session behavior) — full correctness, not degraded correctness, per
invariant 4. This must hold as a property, not merely a start-of-life
edge case: a first caller after an idle-exit is never worse off than before
this tier existed.

## Ref-count / linger algorithm

- **Register** on `SUBSCRIBE` (or first successful `REQUEST` for a
  fire-and-forget caller that skips explicit subscribe) — one entry per
  `client_id`, storing last-seen time.
- **Release** two ways, both required (neither alone is reliable):
  - **Explicit**: the client's clean shutdown (socket close after a
    `RELEASE`, or plain disconnect) drops its entry immediately.
  - **Liveness-reaped**: a subscriber whose connection silently dies (crash,
    kill -9) is dropped once its entry exceeds a bounded staleness window,
    the same liveness-reconciliation discipline the `single-instance-lease`
    already applies to daemon ownership — never a subscriber pinning the
    daemon alive forever because it vanished uncleanly.
- **Linger**: refcount reaching zero starts a bounded grace timer (not an
  immediate exit) so a rapid unsubscribe/resubscribe churn (e.g. consecutive
  hook invocations a few hundred ms apart) does not thrash the daemon up and
  down. Any new subscribe before the timer fires cancels it.
- **Idle-exit**: the daemon exits only when the linger timer fires with
  refcount still zero; it clears its own rendezvous file first so no client
  can discover a stale endpoint mid-shutdown (same discipline `zdd`'s
  cutover already uses for its routing table).

## Applying the shape: the named consumers

- **#2323 — agent-worktrees resident accelerator (classify/list).** Extends
  `hook_ipc.py`'s existing listener with a new coalescing request kind, and
  makes `list_cache.py`'s demand-inferred idle-exit explicit per this
  document's ref-count/linger algorithm instead of the current fixed-TTL
  heuristic. The Phase 4c single-instance-lease around `_classify_records`
  remains the fallback path for "no daemon reachable," not superseded.
- **agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator — per-worktree status
  bundle.** A second, independent daemon instance
  (`worktree_status_daemon.py`) alongside `classify_daemon.py`'s, keyed
  per-worktree rather than per-project-batch (a Tasks-board card asks about
  exactly one worktree, so batching unrelated worktrees into one compute
  call would make one caller wait on -- or receive -- another's data). Adds
  a genuine cache layer this pattern's other two consumers don't need
  (`worktree_status_cache.py`, SQLite/WAL-backed, in-memory hot-path read
  authority): `CoalescingServer` alone only deduplicates concurrent
  requests, so a caller needing real fast-cache reads with an explicit
  force-refresh (per the `agent-worktrees` vision's
  `force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit`) layers that cache in front of the
  coalescing server rather than expecting `CoalescingServer` itself to
  provide it. This is also the first consumer exercising this pattern's
  **cross-venv** discovery path (see below) -- its intended external
  consumer (agent-dispatch's Tasks-board card) is a separate plugin in its
  own venv, not an in-process caller.
- **#744 (this issue) — agent-mcp multiplexer.** A per-`(host, server)`
  daemon holding one warm runtime + one shared upstream connection; each
  session's stdio process becomes a thin shim that subscribes and forwards.
  **Strictly gated by identity/credential equivalence** — the multiplexer key
  is `(server identity, resolved credentials)`, never just `(host, server
  name)`; two sessions with different credentials for the same named server
  never share a runtime. A session that cannot reach the multiplexer (or
  whose credentials don't match any pooled instance) falls back to today's
  direct, per-session bridge — unconditionally correct, per invariant 4.

## Cross-venv consumers: discovery without an in-process import

Every consumer above so far calls the daemon **from inside the same plugin**
that owns it (agent-worktrees' own `_classify_records`, its own future
`worktree_status_bundle` caller). A **cross-venv** consumer — a different
plugin, installed standalone in its own venv, that cannot import the owning
plugin's Python at all (see `pivots.py`'s own venv-isolation contract: a
contributed pivot's data flows only through the contributing plugin's CLI on
`PATH`, never a cross-venv import) — still needs a way to find the daemon's
rendezvous fields and speak the wire protocol, without that import.

This pattern's wire protocol already makes this possible: it is a plain
JSON-over-socket protocol (see `client.py`'s `request()`/`subscribe()`/
`release()`, ~80 lines of pure stdlib), so a cross-venv consumer never needs
the owning plugin's Python — only its rendezvous fields and the protocol
version. **Do not invent a new discovery mechanism for this.** The exact
precedent already exists for agent-worktrees' own resident monitor:
`scripts/hook_client.py` (itself a standalone script that does not import
the `agent_worktrees` package) resolves the runtime root via the reusable
`scripts/registry_root.py` helper — `~/.agent-worktrees` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.agent-worktrees` on Windows) by default, or an
installation-cell-scoped root when `COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT` is set — then
reads `status-monitor.lock` at that root for the rendezvous fields it needs.

A cross-venv consumer of any daemon under this pattern follows the same
shape:

1. **Locate the lock file** via the standard, already-established,
   user-global discovery flow above — either vendor `registry_root.py`
   verbatim (it carries no dependency on the rest of the owning plugin's
   Python) or implement the simpler legacy-only fallback
   (`home/.agent-worktrees`) if installation-cell awareness isn't needed.
   Never invent a dedicated pointer file for this — the lock file already
   is one.
2. **Read the daemon's own namespaced rendezvous fields** out of that lock
   file (e.g. `classify_transport`/`classify_endpoint`/`classify_token`/
   `classify_generation` for classify_daemon;
   `worktree_status_transport`/`worktree_status_endpoint`/
   `worktree_status_token`/`worktree_status_generation` for
   worktree_status_daemon) — each daemon's own module documents its exact
   field names.
3. **Speak the wire protocol directly** (`PROTOCOL_VERSION`, the
   request/subscribe/release message shapes in `client.py`) — reimplement
   or vendor it; it has no dependency on the owning plugin.
4. **On any miss** (no daemon, unreachable, malformed response), report the
   requested facts as stale/unknown rather than blocking a render/click
   path or silently recomputing — the narrow, named exception to invariant
   4 above for a consumer whose own contract forbids the inline fallback an
   in-process caller would use instead.

## Validation

Extend the adversarial mock harness already used for Phase 4b(ii)/#2323
(`tools/clean-room/scenarios/plugin-process-hygiene-convergence/`) with
scenarios that hold regardless of which consumer sits on top of the shared
helper:

- **cold-boot-and-wait-for-port** — first caller boots the daemon and
  receives a correct answer within its boot-wait budget.
- **concurrent-callers-during-cold-boot** — N simultaneous first callers:
  exactly one boots, the rest wait, all receive the correct answer (no
  duplicate boot, no caller silently dropped).
- **ref-counted-exit-after-linger** — the daemon lingers until the last
  subscriber's grace period elapses, then exits and clears rendezvous.
- **fallback-to-direct-computation-on-boot-timeout** — a boot-wait or
  request-deadline expiry produces the correct inline/direct-bridge answer,
  not an error or a hang.
- **subprocess-free-consumer-reports-stale-on-timeout** — a caller
  operating under its own documented subprocess-free contract (the named
  exception above) that misses its boot/subscribe wait reports the
  affected facts as stale/unknown, never a silent recompute, a hang, or a
  bare error — and never for a caller whose own contract doesn't actually
  forbid an inline fallback.
- **credential-mismatch-never-pools** (agent-mcp-specific) — two callers for
  the same named server with different resolved credentials each get their
  own runtime; a coalescing bug that would pool them is a hard test failure.

Each scenario asserts **zero leftover processes** (daemon or transient
client) after the run, the same census discipline the existing mock harness
already applies.

## Sequencing

This document was the design-first step the effort's own convention
requires before further plugin code change. **Landed:** the reusable helper
— [`libs/work-coalescing-singleton/`](../../libs/work-coalescing-singleton/README.md),
a pure-stdlib library implementing this wire protocol, the coalescing map,
and the ref-count/linger/liveness-reap algorithm described above (unit +
wire tests covering coalescing, distinct-key independence, error
propagation, linger cancel-on-resubscribe, and liveness reaping).

**In progress — `#2323` (agent-worktrees resident classify/list
accelerator):** the helper is now vendored into
`plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/work-coalescing-singleton/`, and
`agent_worktrees.classify_daemon` provides the request-kind-specific wire
wrappers (`start_server`, `rendezvous_fields`, `classify_via_daemon`), with
its own tests. **Deliberately not yet wired into any command** —
`cmd_status_monitor` does not start this daemon or publish its rendezvous,
and `_classify_records` does not try it before its existing
`single_instance_lease`-guarded path. Wiring those in is real behavior
change to a live, widely-depended-on resident process and stays its own
follow-up, done with the same test discipline once ready (see the effort
journal for the concrete plan: the daemon's `compute` callback resolves a
project's records itself via `tracking.list_records`, so a request payload
only needs to name the project — never serialize whole records over the
wire).

**Still open — `#2323` (agent-worktrees resident classify/list
accelerator):** the helper is now vendored into
`plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/work-coalescing-singleton/`, and
`agent_worktrees.classify_daemon` provides the request-kind-specific wire
wrappers (`start_server`, `rendezvous_fields`, `classify_via_daemon`), with
its own tests. **Deliberately not yet wired into any command** —
`cmd_status_monitor` does not start this daemon or publish its rendezvous,
and `_classify_records` does not try it before its existing
`single_instance_lease`-guarded path. Wiring those in is real behavior
change to a live, widely-depended-on resident process and stays its own
follow-up, done with the same test discipline once ready (see the effort
journal for the concrete plan: the daemon's `compute` callback resolves a
project's records itself via `tracking.list_records`, so a request payload
only needs to name the project — never serialize whole records over the
wire).

**Correction — the agent-mcp multiplexer was already built, entirely
independently of this document.** An earlier revision of this section
described it as unstarted; that was wrong (it conflated issue #744's body
text, written before implementation, with its actual current state — its
own *comments* record five already-merged slices: `BridgeSession` + a
resident `serve` session-host, #763; a thin `agent-mcp forward` child,
#861; the host's single-instance lease + idle-evict, #863; a genuinely-thin
forwarder with a proven RAM win, #864; and the default-on flip, #865). It
independently realizes this same shape — coalescing many sessions' cost
onto one warm host, ref-counted attach/detach, bounded idle self-eviction,
an always-correct direct-bridge fallback — without importing this document's
library, which postdates it. The only item the issue's own tracking left
open was a clean-room process-topology scenario, **landed** as
[`tools/clean-room/scenarios/agent-mcp-multiplexer/`](../../tools/clean-room/scenarios/agent-mcp-multiplexer/manifest.json)
(#866): asserts N sessions collapse onto exactly one resident host, the
`AGENT_MCP_NO_MULTIPLEX` direct fallback spawns zero hosts, and the host
self-evicts after its last attached session detaches.

**Landed — `agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator` (per-worktree
status bundle).** A second, independent `CoalescingServer` instance
(`worktree_status_daemon.py`), keyed per-worktree rather than per-project-
batch, wired into `cmd_status_monitor` alongside `classify_daemon`'s own
server (started/torn down the same never-fatal way). Adds
`worktree_status_cache.py`, a genuine SQLite/WAL-backed durable cache this
pattern's other two consumers don't need — in-memory hot-path reads, a
background sweep keeping demanded worktrees warm, and an explicit `force`
payload flag for the vision's `force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit`. Also
the first consumer to exercise this document's own "Cross-venv consumers"
section above, and the first in-process reference consumer wired end-to-end
(`agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle --worktree <id> [--force-refresh]`,
mirroring
`_classify_records`'s own daemon-first/fallback structure). Its intended
cross-venv consumer (agent-dispatch's Tasks-board card) is tracked in a
separate effort (`agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`), not built here.
