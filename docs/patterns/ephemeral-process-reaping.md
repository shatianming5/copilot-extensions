# Pattern: ephemeral-process-reaping

**Serves:** *Vision plugin-services* — resource hygiene underpins every
lifecycle tier; an unreaped background process is the same availability/
host-health failure whether or not it is a registered "service".
**Exemplars:** agent-worktrees (per-worktree `git fsmonitor--daemon`, the
`status-monitor`'s `pane_reaper.py` dead-mux-pane reconciliation, `gc.py`'s
orphan-directory sweep); agent-mcp's stdio `Bridge.run()` idle self-reap
(the downstream tracker — a *different* shape, see the Variant below).

## Problem

A plugin frequently needs a helper process (or a per-worktree/per-task
resource) that must outlive its immediate invocation — specifically, it must
survive the parent shell/session ending, an SSH connection dropping briefly,
or environment variables that only exist for one invocation.
`DETACHED_PROCESS` / `start_new_session=True` / `git ... --detach` solve
exactly that survival problem. But survival and reaping are two different
obligations, and detaching only ever solves the first. Once the reason the
process exists goes away — the worktree it served, the session that owned
it, the task it was running — nothing sweeps it up unless the plugin builds
that in on purpose. This is not a rare edge case: it is the **default**
outcome, because a detached process is, by construction, unreachable through
the parent's own exit/cleanup path that would otherwise have caught it.

This recurs because each layer looks like it solves it and doesn't:

- **A graceful-shutdown hook** (`sessionEnd`, `atexit`, a signal handler)
  looks like a sufficient reap trigger. It is not: it never runs on an abrupt
  kill (Windows tearing down a terminal window and its whole process tree at
  once, `Stop-Process`, a crash, an OOM kill) — exactly the situations
  detaching was meant to survive in the first place.
- **A preservation-oriented lifecycle command** (`finalize`/`cleanup`, or
  anything whose job is "mark this unit of work concluded while keeping its
  state inspectable" — see
  [service-lifecycle-supervision](service-lifecycle-supervision.md) and
  [drop-in-registry-hygiene](drop-in-registry-hygiene.md)) is the wrong place
  to *also* own process teardown. Conflating "concluded" with "kill its
  background helper" either blocks legitimate preservation or silently drops
  the teardown obligation whenever preservation wins.
- **It is invisible day-to-day.** Each single leaked process is small (a few
  MB, near-zero CPU), so nothing alarms until dozens-to-hundreds accumulate
  across a fleet of worktrees/sessions built up over weeks — at which point
  it presents as generic "why is my machine hot / why are there so many
  processes", far from the code that caused it.

Recent incidents in this repo: agent-worktrees' per-worktree `git
fsmonitor--daemon` leaked across every worktree that ever ran a git command,
un-reaped by `finalize` (#2265) — and still un-reaped after that sessionEnd
fix whenever the session died abruptly instead of exiting cleanly
(#2269/#2270). The same shape motivated `gc.py`'s orphan-directory sweep
(#66, #828, #1027) and `pane_reaper.py`'s dead-mux-pane reconciliation.

## Standard approach

**Every detached process needs an independent reaper, not a cooperative
one.** Design the reap trigger around the real signal that the process's
reason for existing has ended — not around a notification that may or may
not arrive:

1. **Identify the owning unit and its real liveness signal(s).** A
   worktree's liveness is its mux session membership *and* whether any of
   its registered Copilot sessions still holds a live PID lock
   (`sessions.worktree_has_live_session`) — not "did a hook fire". A
   registered service's liveness is its own lease/lock file. Pick the
   signal(s) that stay true or false correctly regardless of *how* the
   owning unit died.
2. **Poll, don't only hook.** Keep a hook-based reap as the fast path for the
   clean-exit case (cheap, worth having) but pair it with a periodic,
   liveness-based sweep that requires no cooperation from the dying process
   at all. This repo already runs exactly such a resident sweep — the
   `status-monitor`'s bounded per-record reconciler
   (`session_catalog.ResidentSessionReconciler`) — extend it rather than
   inventing a second poller.
3. **Corroborate before acting.** A single stale/racy signal (an aged mux
   snapshot, a lock file not yet cleaned up) is not enough to reap on its
   own. Require an *authoritative, fresh* observation of the primary signal
   (a live→dark **transition**, not merely "currently dark") and cross-check
   a second, independent signal before tearing anything down — see
   `ResidentSessionReconciler._index_record`'s mux-transition + PID-check
   pairing.
4. **Make the reap itself idempotent and silent.** Stopping an
   already-stopped process, or reaping a resource whose owning directory is
   already gone, must be a normal, silent no-op — never an error the sweep
   has to special-case (`tracking.stop_fsmonitor_daemon`: missing git,
   missing daemon, and a since-removed worktree directory are all fine
   outcomes).
5. **Never fold this into a preservation-oriented lifecycle command.**
   `finalize` (or any "mark concluded, keep inspectable" command) must not
   also own killing a companion process. Give the reap its own trigger (hook
   + poll), decoupled from whether the unit is ever finalized at all.

## Rationale

Detaching a process solves exactly one problem — surviving the parent's
exit — and, by construction, removes the parent's own ability to clean it up
afterward. Treating reaping as "someone else's problem" (a hook, a later
`finalize`) is how it silently becomes nobody's problem. A liveness-signal
poller costs nothing when nothing has died, and is the only mechanism that
reliably fires on every death path — clean exit, abrupt kill, and crash
alike.

## Variant: an attached child whose logical caller outlives it, nested inside a physical parent that outlives *that*

The problem above assumes the leaking process was deliberately **detached**
to survive its parent. A second, distinct shape produces the identical
symptom (unbounded process accumulation, invisible day-to-day, discovered
only once dozens-to-hundreds have piled up) from the opposite setup: a
process that was **never detached** — it has a real, live OS parent the
whole time — but still outlives its actual reason for existing, because
that reason is a **logical** scope nested *inside* the physical parent, and
the physical parent is much longer-lived than that inner scope.

`agent-mcp`'s stdio `Bridge.run()` is the exemplar
(the downstream tracker): a `task()` sub-agent delegation spawns a
per-delegation `agent-mcp bridge` process (and, for a `stdio` upstream, its
own heavier child, e.g. `bunx gitea-mcp`). The bridge's OS parent is the
**top-level Copilot session**, which stays alive long after that one
delegation's sub-agent has finished — so the two standard termination
signals (stdin EOF, parent-death) never fire: the parent process that would
send either signal is still very much running. Confirmed directly by reading
`bridge.py`: both signals were implemented correctly and fire reliably for
the *general* case; neither is wrong, they simply answer a different
question ("has my physical parent gone away?") than the one that actually
matters ("has the logical operation I exist to serve concluded?"). Three
prior WSL reproductions (2026-07-31/08-18/08-22) had already established
every leaked bridge was parented to a **live**, non-dead process — the
signature of exactly this variant, not a classic orphan.

**A polling liveness-reconciler (the standard approach above) does not fit
here either.** There is no independent, external observer that can see "is
the sub-agent that spawned this bridge still doing anything with it" — that
information exists *only* inside the bridge's own request/response traffic.
The fix is not a poller; it's an **idle self-check the process runs on
itself**, dual-gated the same way a liveness reconciler cross-checks two
signals before acting (Standard approach, step 3):

1. **Elapsed time since the last unit of real work** (here: the last client
   message read off stdin) is necessary but not sufficient — a slow
   in-flight call can legitimately run longer than the idle window.
2. **An authoritative in-flight-work signal** (here: `BridgeSession
   .has_pending`, backed by the session's own dispatch-task set) gates step 1:
   self-reap fires only when *both* the idle window has elapsed *and* zero
   work is in flight. This mirrors `serve.py`'s own resident-daemon
   `_maybe_idle_evict` (attached-session refcount + warm-pool size, gating an
   idle clock) — the *same* dual-gate discipline, reused for a per-invocation
   child instead of a shared daemon.

**Recognize this variant when:** the process's *physical* OS parent is
correctly identified and genuinely alive (ruling out the classic-orphan
case above), the process nonetheless leaks, and the thing it actually exists
to serve is a bounded, inner operation — a single delegation, a single
request batch, a single task — that a still-live *outer* host process
(a persistent session, a resident daemon, a long-running supervisor) merely
happens to contain. Detached-child pollers can't see that inner boundary;
only an idle/inactivity self-check running inside the process itself can.
