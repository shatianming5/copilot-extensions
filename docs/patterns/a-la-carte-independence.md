# Pattern: a-la-carte-independence

**Serves:** *Vision plugin-services* §Features/`a-la-carte-installability`,

`degrade-gracefully`; §Non-Goals/`no-mandatory-central-coordinator`;
§Concepts & Components/`Plugin-stack tier`, `Claim provider`.
**Exemplars:** agent-mcp (standalone), agent-bridge ↔ agent-codespaces /
agent-containers (provider-manifest registry), agent-worktrees ↔
agent-dispatch / agent-codespaces / agent-containers (claim-provider registry).

## Problem

Each plugin is installed from the marketplace **independently**. A user picks any
subset. A plugin therefore cannot assume a particular sibling is installed, that a
particular service is running, or that any shared machine-wide plumbing exists — and
yet, when several plugins *are* present, they should cooperate without the user
hand-wiring them.

## Standard approach

**Standalone-first.** A plugin's core function works with only what its own
installer deployed. A single-plugin install is a supported, first-class
configuration — not a degraded one. Reaching a plugin never depends on an external
proxy/tunnel/registry (an **invariant**, see the hub).

**Graceful composition.** Optional cross-plugin capabilities light up **when the
peer is present** and stay dark otherwise. A missing sibling degrades a *feature*,
never the whole plugin. Composition is opportunistic and peer-wise — there is **no
mandatory central coordinator** every plugin depends on.

**The provider-manifest sub-pattern.** When one plugin extends another's service
rather than running its own daemon, it registers as a **namespace provider** through
a filesystem **manifest registry** — it does **not** import its package into the
host service's venv. Each provider drops a small JSON manifest into the host
service's registry dir (e.g. `~/.agent-bridge/providers.d/<name>.json`) from its own
`sessionStart` hook, declaring the `<prefix>:` namespace it serves and an
**absolute** binstub command; the host daemon scans that dir on demand and drives
the provider's binstub **over a process boundary**
(`<command> namespace-list` / `namespace-resolve …`). agent-bridge sources the
`codespace:` / `container:` namespaces (and the codespaces credential relay) this
way. Why a manifest and not an import: the daemon runs from its own isolated
versioned venv where a provider package is neither importable nor on `PATH`, so an
absolute-command manifest is the only seam that survives. Two rules keep it clean:

- **One canonical CLI per plugin.** The provider keeps ownership of its own binstub
  and runtime; the host service **must not re-point** it. Register the *binstub via a
  manifest*, never re-point it.
- **The host degrades if the provider is absent.** A provider is optional: a missing
  or malformed manifest is skipped with a warning and discovery never raises, so a
  peer's absence darkens only that namespace, never the host daemon. The sweep
  reconciles the current desired set rather than retaining providers it saw once,
  and the host's doctor command identifies stale entries and exact cleanup. The
  suite-wide warning, provenance, reconciliation, and doctor rules are the
  [`drop-in-registry-hygiene`](drop-in-registry-hygiene.md) pattern.

**The plugin-stack layering rule.** The suite's plugins sit in one explicit,
ordered, one-way dependency stack (lowest to highest): agent-machines,
agent-ssh, agent-worktrees, agent-mcp, agent-logger (optional), agent-vault
(optional), agent-bridge, agent-codespaces/agent-containers, agent-dispatch,
agent-index. A plugin may call **downward**, gracefully degrading if the
lower tier is absent — it must never call **upward** directly (no ambient
`PATH`/`shutil.which` lookup of a higher-tier sibling's binstub, no importing
its package). Functionality a higher tier owns is exposed to a lower tier
exclusively through a drop-in contribution registry the *lower* tier itself
owns — the higher tier contributes a manifest into it, never the reverse.
The provider-manifest sub-pattern above is the general shape this rule
requires; the **claim-provider** instance below is one concrete registry
built on it.

**The claim-provider instance.** agent-worktrees (tier 3) owns the claims
ledger (`claims add|release|settle|sweep|mirror-status|cleanup|orphans`) for
resources a worktree can hold — a CodeSpace, a container, a dispatch task,
... — several of which are actually owned by higher-tier plugins
(agent-codespaces, agent-containers, agent-dispatch). Rather than
agent-worktrees hardcoding a call to each higher-tier sibling's CLI to check
a claim's status (an upward call, forbidden by the rule above), each
claim-owning plugin registers as a **claim provider**: it ships a static
`<plugin_root>/claim-providers/<namespace>.json` template in its own
payload declaring the claim **namespace** it serves (e.g. `codespace:`,
`container:`, `dispatch-task:`) and one or both **status-check**/
**reclaim** callback argv templates. Unlike the bridge-provider's
config-dir-plus-sessionStart-hook registry, agent-worktrees discovers these
templates by scanning the **installed-plugins tree directly** (mirroring
this same plugin's own pivot and claim-kind registries) — no separate
registration step, since the manifest ships with, and is always current
with, the contributing plugin's own installed version. agent-worktrees
verifies the contributing plugin's identity, resolves the declared command
only to that plugin's own payload-local binstub (never ambient `PATH`),
and invokes the callback for status/reclaim — never importing the
provider's package, never assuming its internal layout, and degrading that
one namespace's resolution (never the whole claims command) if the
provider is absent or its manifest is malformed.

**No cross-plugin reach-around.** A plugin talks to a sibling through the sibling's
declared surface (its CLI, its service endpoint, its resolver), never by poking the
sibling's runtime files or assuming its internal layout.

**Version optional authorization contracts.** A provider may ask an optional
sibling whether an owner is authorized to create shared coordination state.
Missing commands, malformed/unversioned responses, and unknown versions behave
as an absent peer; only an explicit rejection from a compatible version blocks
provider work. The owner project is passed explicitly across the process
boundary, and the check precedes local ownership and external provider side
effects. A compatible rejection exits agent-codespaces with `78`; agent-bridge
treats that value as a bounced dispatch rather than a degradable bookkeeping
error. See
[`state-root-bound coordination`](state-root-coordination.md).

**Session guidance remains plugin-local.** Each plugin projects its own static
pointer and writes its own exact-session guidance file without requiring a
sibling coordinator. Direct bootstrap and reconciliation side effects remain
owned by that plugin. If a supported host later proves native composition of
independent `additionalContext` outputs, plugins may activate their own direct
contributors without adding a cross-plugin authority.

## Rationale

À-la-carte independence is what lets the marketplace be a *menu* rather than a
bundle. Standalone-first guarantees any single choice works; graceful composition
makes the whole feel coherent when fully installed — without a central authority
whose absence would break everyone.
