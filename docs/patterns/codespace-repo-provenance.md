# Pattern: codespace-repo-provenance

**Serves:** *Vision agent-codespaces* §Features/`config-by-adoption`,
`headless-agent-hosting`; §Provenance — the venue side of the fabric's
"dispatch a repo you have no local checkout of" golden path.
**Exemplars:** `example-web-harness` (example-marketplace) → `agent-codespaces` (the honorer);
composes with `agent-bridge` for `codespace:<name>` dispatch.
**Related:** [`a-la-carte-independence`](a-la-carte-independence.md) (the
provider-manifest seam agent-codespaces uses to reach agent-bridge);
[`install-vs-adopt-boundary`](install-vs-adopt-boundary.md) (why a provider config
is lowest-precedence and never writes back).

## Problem

A control-harness agent is asked to *"make a change in `<product>`"* for a product
that has **no local checkout** — it lives only as a GitHub CodeSpace built from a
`<product>-codespaces` vessel repo. For a dispatched agent to actually land a
change there, two facts must be known **before** the CodeSpace is reached, and
neither is derivable from the CodeSpace name alone:

1. **Repo provenance** — *which product checkout on the box the agent should work
   in.* A CodeSpace's own repository is the **vessel** (`<org>/<product>-codespaces`),
   but the product is checked out at `/workspaces/<product>`, not
   `/workspaces/<product>-codespaces`. Launch the agent in the wrong folder and its
   tools operate against an empty/vessel directory, or `/home/<user>` (dotfiles#1274).
   The vessel→product link, the machine size, the pinned devcontainer, the ADO
   host for credential relay, and any per-venue provision hooks are all
   **provenance** the resolver needs.
2. **In-venue capability** — *which plugins the agent inside the CodeSpace needs.*
   The dispatched agent wants the product's own operator skills
   (`<product>-agent`: build/test/killswitch/lifecycle lore) loaded **inside** the
   venue — not on the harness.

The naive answer is "author a control-plane repo that adopts a
`.agent-codespaces/config.yaml`." But the golden path — *a colleague enables three
plugins and dispatches* — must work with **no control-plane repo at all**. The
provenance and the in-venue plugin list have to travel **with the product's own
harness plugin**, discovered by convention.

## Standard approach

A **`<repo>-harness`** plugin (see the `authoring-harness-plugins` skill for the
family) carries the venue's provenance and its in-venue plugin list, and
`agent-codespaces` honors both through two dependency-free, convention-discovered
seams. The harness plugin **depends on `agent-codespaces`** (the honorer) and
writes into no repo.

### Seam 1 — repo provenance via `codespaceConfig`

The harness plugin **ships** its venue policy in place, as a *supplementary*
`.agent-codespaces/config.yaml` fragment under its own `references/`, and makes it
discoverable by declaring that relative path in its active `plugin.json`:

```
<repo>-harness/
├── plugin.json                              # codespaceConfig + codespacePlugins
└── references/agent-codespaces/config.yaml  # the venue provenance (read in place)
```

```jsonc
{
  "name": "example-web-harness",
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "agent-codespaces", "marketplace": "copilot-extensions" }
  ],
  "codespaceConfig": "references/agent-codespaces/config.yaml"
}
```

`agent-codespaces` uses effective plugin activation as authority, reads the
declaration from that plugin's identity-verified active root, proves the target
is a contained regular readable file, validates the existing supplementary
config shape, and merges it at the **lowest precedence**. Any adopted-repo/cwd
config still overrides it. Invalid declarations are isolated and surfaced in
doctor/readiness diagnostics with the plugin identity, manifest, target, and
reason. A disabled plugin contributes nothing.

User-level `config.d` pointers remain compatibility inputs, not required
authority. When a valid active declaration and a pointer claim the same plugin
identity, the active declaration wins and the pointer is reported separately as
superseded (or with its own stale/malformed finding).

The provenance itself lives under `repos.<vessel>`:

```yaml
# references/agent-codespaces/config.yaml — supplementary; only what convention
# can't derive. Machine/location defaults, /workspaces/<basename>, and the
# github.com + ADO credential relay are all handled automatically.
credentials:
  ado_host: my-org.visualstudio.com          # bare get-access-token host for the org
repos:
  example-org/example-web-codespaces:          # the VESSEL repo (the CodeSpace's own repository)
    workspace_repo: example-web                    # -> agent lands in /workspaces/example-web (the PRODUCT)
    machine_type: largePremiumLinux256gb
    devcontainer_path: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json   # pin when the vessel ships >1
    provision:                                  # per-venue setup deployed on SSH connect
      files: [ ... ]
      on_connect: [ ... ]
```

`workspace_repo` is the crux of provenance: it is what makes
`effective_acp_command_for(<vessel>)` emit `cd /workspaces/example-web && copilot
--acp --stdio --allow-all --experimental`, and what `resolved_workspace_folder_for` publishes
to agent-bridge as the ACP `session/new` cwd — so a dispatched agent's tools are
rooted in the product checkout.

**Why a manifest declaration, not a copy, pointer, or writeback:** the edge stays
one-way and dependency-free. The plugin ships a default and declares it in
place; agent-codespaces discovers it from the already-active payload; neither
writes into user state or another repo. A plugin update keeps the target and
declaration aligned. Because provider config merges last, it never overrides a
consumer who keeps an adopted repo — it is the default when there is none. This
keeps the *install/adopt boundary* intact.

### Seam 2 — in-venue plugins via `codespacePlugins`

The harness plugin declares, in its `plugin.json`, the plugins to install **into**
a CodeSpace on connect — the in-venue `<repo>-agent` and friends — via a custom
`codespacePlugins` array (an *unrecognized* top-level manifest field the core CLI
ignores; `agent-codespaces` is its sole consumer):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "example-web-harness",
  "dependencies": [ { "name": "agent-codespaces", "marketplace": "copilot-extensions" } ],
  "codespacePlugins": [
    { "source": "example-web-agent@example-marketplace", "enable": true,
      "forWorkspaceRepo": "example-org/example-web*" }
  ]
}
```

`forWorkspaceRepo` (string, list, or omitted) **scopes** an entry to CodeSpaces of
a given workspace repo; omit it and the entry applies to *every* CodeSpace this
harness provisions. `agent-codespaces` (`resolve_codespace_plugins`) sweeps the
installed harness plugins, filters by the target CodeSpace's workspace repo,
de-duplicates, and injects the resolved set into the CodeSpace's **user**
`~/.copilot/settings.json` on connect — so the in-venue agent loads them without a
human touching the CodeSpace.

### The composition (end to end)

```
control harness (3 plugins enabled)                     GitHub CodeSpace
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐            ┌────────────────────────────┐
│ agent-bridge   ── codespace:<name> ─────▶│  dispatch  │ /workspaces/<product>       │
│ agent-codespaces (honors both seams)     │──────────▶ │  + <product>-agent plugin   │
│ <repo>-harness  ── codespaceConfig       │            │    (injected, Seam 2)       │
│                 └─ codespacePlugins       │            │  ACP cwd = provenance folder │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘            └────────────────────────────┘
     Seam 1 gives provenance ─────────────┘  (workspace_repo -> /workspaces/<product>)
```

- **`agent-bridge`** sources the `codespace:` namespace from `agent-codespaces`
  (the provider-manifest seam, see `a-la-carte-independence`) and dispatches.
- **`agent-codespaces`** resolves the launch: reads the provenance (Seam 1) to
  build the `cd <folder> && copilot …` command and publish the ACP cwd, and injects
  the in-venue plugins (Seam 2).
- **`<repo>-harness`** supplies both — with **no control-plane repo** and **no
  writeback** into any repo.

## Rationale

- **Golden path with no control-plane repo.** The provenance and in-venue plugin
  list are the *product's* facts, so they belong with the *product's* harness
  plugin — versioned with it, updated with it. A colleague enables three plugins and
  dispatches; they never author a hub repo. (The heavier repo-scaffolding path — a
  `setup-venue` that writes config + tools into a control-plane repo for a full
  build-capable venue — stays available for consumers who want it, but is **not
  required** for the golden path.)
- **One-way, dependency-free edges.** Both seams are unrecognized manifest
  fields consumed only by agent-codespaces. It never imports the provider plugin,
  and the provider writes no agent-codespaces state. A stale or malformed
  declaration is isolated, warns with an actionable finding, and is reported by
  `agent-codespaces doctor` under the suite-wide
  [`drop-in-registry-hygiene`](drop-in-registry-hygiene.md) fault-isolation
  contract.
- **Provenance is authoritative, not guessed.** `workspace_repo` makes the
  vessel→product link explicit, so the ACP cwd is the product checkout by
  construction — not a fragile parse of the launch string, and not `/home/<user>`.
- **Precedence keeps adoption sovereign.** Provider config merges last, so a
  consumer who adopts a repo config always wins; the provider is the floor,
  never a ceiling.

## Anti-patterns

- **Installing a `<repo>-harness` (or its injected `<repo>-agent`) on the venue.**
  The harness plugin is central-harness-only; the `<repo>-agent` is injected into the
  CodeSpace, never enabled on the harness. (See the naming/propagation grammar in
  `authoring-harness-plugins`.)
- **Materializing a user-level pointer or config copy as required authority.**
  Ship the config in `references/` and declare its relative path in
  `codespaceConfig`; compatibility pointers must not override the active
  declaration.
- **Relying on the provider to *override* a consumer's config.** It is lowest
  precedence by design; put anything that must win in the consumer's adopted repo.
- **Omitting the `agent-codespaces` dependency** from a plugin that uses either
  seam. The honorer must be present for the seams to fire.
- **Baking the workspace folder into a raw `acp_command`** when a `workspace_repo`
  would do — the derived path also feeds the structured ACP cwd; a hand-written
  `cd` does not.
