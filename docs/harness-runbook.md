# Control-Harness Runbook

> **Audience: an agent.** This is an opinionated, step-by-step runbook for
> turning a repo into an effective **agent harness** — a control-plane repo
> that drives Copilot CLI sessions, cross-agent/cross-machine work, planning,
> and MCP-backed tools using the `copilot-extensions` plugin suite.
>
> It is deliberately **opinionated about the harness itself** and deliberately
> **unopinionated about the product** the harness operates on. Read the
> [Opinion contract](#the-opinion-contract) before you touch anything.

For the *concepts* behind a control-harness repo (what it is, why one repo),
read the [README § Concepts](../README.md#concepts-the-control-harness-repo)
first. This runbook is the *procedure*; the README is the *why*.

---

## How to use this runbook

You will be invoked in one of three modes. Detect which from the operator's
ask and the state of the current directory.

| Mode | Operator says something like | Starting point |
|------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Greenfield** | "Make me a control repo like this" | An empty/vanilla folder (e.g. a home dir). No repo yet. |
| **Brownfield** | "Build out my harness like this" | An existing repo that is not yet a harness. |
| **Audit** | "Make sure my repo follows harness best practices" | A repo already wired as a harness (possibly by an older version of this system). |

A fresh agent launched in a vanilla folder can reach this runbook by
**fetching it from the repo URL** — no plugins need be installed yet. Fetch
this file (`docs/harness-runbook.md`) plus the
[README](../README.md), then follow the phases below. The early phases install
the very plugins whose skills the later phases lean on.

> **In a loaded session**, the `customizing-copilot` plugin's
> **`customizing-copilot:building-harnesses`** skill is the trigger-discoverable entry point to this
> runbook (it routes here and frames the run), and **`reviewing-customizations`**
> operationalizes [Phase 8](#phase-8--validate-skills-and-agents).

**All three modes run the same phases.** The difference is only whether each
phase *creates*, *extends*, or *verifies*:

- **Greenfield** — create everything from scratch.
- **Brownfield** — add what is missing; leave the operator's existing product
  code untouched.
- **Audit** — treat every phase's **"Done when"** as a checklist; report drift
  and fix it in place. See [Audit mode](#audit-mode) for the condensed pass.

**Drive it, don't dictate it.** Where a phase names an *unopinionated seam*,
ask the operator (use a structured question) rather than guessing. Where a
phase is *opinionated*, apply the opinion and move on — don't relitigate it.

---

## The opinion contract

The single most important thing about this runbook: it draws a hard line
between the **harness** (opinionated) and the **product** (unopinionated).

### Opinionated — the harness *is* the opinion

These are the load-bearing conventions. Apply them. Each maps to a phase.

1. **Repo structure** for the harness itself — [Phase 1](#phase-1--repo-structure).
2. **Repo-scoped plugin registration** via `.github/copilot/settings.json` +
   experimental mode — [Phase 2](#phase-2--register-repo-scoped-plugins).
3. **Adopting the harness and its related target repos with agent-worktrees** —
   [Phase 3](#phase-3--adopt-the-harness-and-related-repos).
4. **`AGENTS.md` + "connective-tissue" skills** that bind the generic plugin
   skills to *this* repo — [Phase 4](#phase-4--agentsmd-and-connective-tissue-skills).
5. **SSH mesh + agent-bridge topology** — [Phase 5](#phase-5--ssh-and-agent-bridge).
6. **End-to-end validation through the Picker** —
   [Phase 6](#phase-6--validate-end-to-end-with-the-picker).
7. **efforts + visions to guide change** — [Phase 7](#phase-7--enable-efforts-and-visions).
8. **rubber-duck + customizing-copilot to validate skills and agents** —
   [Phase 8](#phase-8--validate-skills-and-agents).
9. **agent-mcp + delegating MCP handling to sub-agents** —
   [Phase 9](#phase-9--agent-mcp-and-mcp-delegation).

### Unopinionated — leave these to the operator

Never impose a default on these. Detect the operator's existing choice, or ask.

1. **Target/product repo structure.** The harness does not dictate how the code
   it operates on is laid out.
2. **Where product code lives.** The harness never **forcibly replicates one
   repo's product-side organization into another party's repo**, and never
   **copies a *related* repo's product into itself** (adopt it as a related repo
   instead — Phase 3). It carries only the **lightweight helpers** it needs to
   drive work. *That said, a harness may legitimately **be its own monorepo**
   that also holds its own product* (`services/`, `tools/`, generators) — being
   both harness and product in one repo is fine. The rule is about **not imposing
   layout across repo boundaries**, not about keeping the harness empty.
3. **Git provider / hosting.** GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, self-hosted — all fine.
   Commands here use forge-neutral git; only fetch/push remotes are
   provider-specific.
4. **Issue-tracking provider.** GitHub Issues, Gitea, Jira, none — the harness
   does not require any particular tracker.
5. **PR / review policy.** Whether changes go direct-to-default-branch or
   through PRs, whether reviews are required, who reviews — operator's call.
6. **Execution substrate.** Local checkout, Codespaces, or local dev
   containers. The plugin suite supports all three; pick per the operator.
7. **Voice / personality / theming.** The suite ships **voice-neutral**. Any
   persona, quips, or theming are host-injected and out of scope here.
8. **Additional harness-control mechanisms.** Schedulers, dashboards, custom
   dispatch policy, extra automation — welcome, but not prescribed.

> **When opinion meets seam:** you *will* create files (Phase 1) inside a repo
> whose product layout is unopinionated. That is fine — the harness files live
> in well-known locations (`.github/`, `docs/`, `efforts/`, `visions/`,
> `tools/setup/`) that don't collide with product code. Keep harness helpers
> lightweight and clearly separated.

## Recommended plugin set

The suite is **fourteen plugins** — more than any single harness needs at once.
Treat this section as the **curated recommendation**, not the full catalog:
enable the tier the harness actually needs, not all fourteen by reflex. The
table below covers the twelve a general harness draws from; the remaining two
(`copilot-extensions-harness`, `wsl-setup`) are special-purpose — see the note
after the table. You will encode the choice in
`.github/copilot/settings.json` in [Phase 2](#phase-2--register-repo-scoped-plugins).

| Plugin | Tier | Enable when |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `agent-worktrees` | **Core** | Always. Session isolation + repo adoption + the Picker. Install first. |
| `customizing-copilot` | **Core** | Always. Teaches authoring skills, sub-agents, MCP servers, plugin installs. Payload-only. |
| `efforts` | **Recommended** | The harness plans stretches of work. Payload-only. |
| `visions` | **Recommended** | The harness keeps a north-star and derives efforts from the delta. Payload-only. |
| `agent-bridge` | **Recommended** | More than one machine/agent, or you want inter-agent sends. |
| `context-handoff` | **Recommended** | Long sessions that risk auto-compaction. Payload-only. |
| `agent-mcp` | **Optional** | The harness wraps an authenticated MCP server for its tools. |
| `agent-logger` | **Optional** | You want structured session logs. |
| `agent-codespaces` | **Optional** | Execution substrate includes GitHub Codespaces. |
| `agent-containers` | **Optional** | Execution substrate includes local Docker dev containers. |
| `agent-dispatch` | **Optional** | Multiple agents must coordinate through an atomic task queue. |
| `agent-vault` | **Optional** | The harness fetches secrets (API keys, SSH keys, credentials) from a local KeePassXC-backed store instead of hardcoding, committing, or env-exporting them. |

**Minimum viable harness:** `agent-worktrees` + `customizing-copilot`.
**Recommended default:** add `efforts`, `visions`, `agent-bridge`,
`context-handoff`. Everything else is opt-in by substrate/need.

> **The two not tiered above are special-purpose, not general-harness picks.**
> `copilot-extensions-harness` is the operator harness for working *on* this
> suite itself — enable it in a control repo that contributes to
> copilot-extensions (it is the reference implementation of the `<repo>-harness`
> standard). `wsl-setup` ships WSL2 provisioning/troubleshooting skills — enable
> it when a harness must stand up or debug a WSL host. Both are payload-only.

> **On consolidation.** Managing many plugins is awkward; this runbook is the
> single place to curate the set. Keep the tiers above as the recommendation and
> **adjust the repo's `enabledPlugins` to match the operator's actual needs** —
> don't enable an optional plugin "just in case." If the suite later consolidates
> into fewer plugins, this table is the seam to update; the phases reference
> capabilities (worktrees, bridge, efforts…), not a fixed plugin count. Whether
> to repackage the suite itself is weighed in
> [docs/plans/plugin-consolidation.md](plans/plugin-consolidation.md).

---

## Setup & adoption skills (index)

Each capability ships a trigger-discoverable **setup skill**. They split along the
[install-vs-adopt boundary](patterns/install-vs-adopt-boundary.md): **install/update**
skills touch only **machine-local** runtime state, while **adopt/scaffold**
commands own only the repo and/or user-state integration scope their contract
declares. This is the single lookup for "which skill sets up what"; the phases
below invoke them in order.

| Skill | Scope | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| `copilot-extensions-setup` | install · machine-local | Deploy/refresh the **agent-worktrees + agent-bridge** runtimes (venv + binstub + service) after a payload update |
| `agent-vault-setup` | install · machine-local | Install/update the **agent-vault** runtime + the `vault-askpass` SUDO_ASKPASS helper |
| `session-sync-setup` | install · machine-local | Deploy **agent-logger**'s `session-sync` task/timer and its target |
| `codespaces-setup` | adopt · repo | Work out of the box on standard CodeSpaces; add a supplementary `.agent-codespaces/config.yaml` only for repos that deviate (adopt, credential-relay sources) |
| `containers-fleet` | adopt · repo | Configure the `containers.yaml` fleet defaults for **agent-containers** |
| `efforts-setup` | scaffold · repo | Scaffold `efforts/` + this repo's efforts addendum (Phase 7) |
| `visions-setup` | scaffold · repo | Scaffold `visions/` + this repo's visions addendum (Phase 7) |
| `create-setup-script` | scaffold · repo | Generate an ACP-safe `tools/setup/setup.{ps1,sh}` (Phase 1) |
| `context-handoff-setup` | verify · no install | Troubleshoot the context-handoff **extension** (it needs no install — just the plugin enabled + experimental mode on) |

> Payload-only plugins (`efforts`, `visions`, `context-handoff`,
> `customizing-copilot`, `harness-*`, `wsl-setup`) have **no runtime to install** —
> their "setup" is enabling the plugin, then scaffolding/adoption where applicable.
> Only the runtime plugins carry an install/update setup skill.

---

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites

**Opinionated.** Every harness assumes these.

- **Copilot CLI** (`copilot` on PATH), **Python 3.10+**, **Git 2.15+**.
- **`uv`** — bootstrapped automatically by the plugin installers if missing.
- **Experimental mode on, once per machine** — the CLI gates *all* extension
  loading on it. In `~/.copilot/settings.json`:
  ```json
  { "experimental": true }
  ```
- Provider CLIs only as needed by chosen optional plugins (`gh` for
  Codespaces/Containers; `docker` for Containers).

**Done when:** `copilot --version` works and `~/.copilot/settings.json` has
`"experimental": true`.

---

## Phase 1 — Repo structure

**Opinionated** about the harness scaffold; **unopinionated** about product
layout.

Greenfield: `git init` the harness repo. Brownfield/Audit: work in place.

Create only these harness-owned locations (leave everything else to the
operator's product):

```
<harness-repo>/
  .github/
    copilot/
      settings.json          # marketplace + enabledPlugins (Phase 2)
    skills/                  # connective-tissue skills (Phase 4)
    hooks/                   # optional guardrail hooks (Phase 4)
  AGENTS.md                  # harness identity + conventions (Phase 4)
  docs/                      # harness docs (what IS)
  efforts/                   # planning (Phase 7; scaffolded by efforts-setup)
  visions/                   # north-star (Phase 7; scaffolded by visions-setup)
  tools/setup/               # session setup script(s) (optional; see below)
  machines.yaml              # topology, if multi-machine (Phase 5); the bridge
                             #   derives its agent roster from this + related.yaml
```

**Keep the harness-driving helpers lightweight — but the repo may be a
monorepo.** If this repo is *only* a control plane, don't scaffold a `services/`
tree, tool generators, or installers unless the harness genuinely needs a
helper; `tools/setup/` is then just the **session setup script** (below) and
small helpers. **If this repo is a monorepo that is both harness and product,
its own `services/`/`tools/` belong here** — that's not a violation. The line
the harness must not cross is **forcing this repo's product organization onto a
*related* repo, or copying a related repo's product in** (adopt it via Phase 3
instead).

**Session setup script (optional but recommended).** If sessions should run
setup before the agent launches (install deps, print status, set env), use the
**`agent-worktrees:create-setup-script`** skill to generate an ACP-safe
`tools/setup/setup.ps1` / `setup.sh`. The script **must launch `copilot` last**
and must pass through `--acp`/`--stdio` unchanged.

**Done when:** the harness locations above exist (only those the harness needs),
and product code is untouched.

---

## Phase 2 — Register repo-scoped plugins

**Opinionated:** register plugins **at repo scope**, not globally. It pins the
set to the repo, keeps machines consistent, and lets the launcher keep payloads
and runtimes fresh automatically. (Skill: **`customizing-copilot:installing-plugins`**.) This is your
first **in-repo** config file; for the full in-repo-vs-machine-local map see
[Configuration](configuration.md).

Write `.github/copilot/settings.json`, declaring the marketplace and the
[tiered set](#recommended-plugin-set) the operator chose:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "copilot-extensions": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "agent-worktrees@copilot-extensions": true,
    "customizing-copilot@copilot-extensions": true,
    "efforts@copilot-extensions": true,
    "visions@copilot-extensions": true,
    "agent-bridge@copilot-extensions": true,
    "context-handoff@copilot-extensions": true
  }
}
```

Trim or extend `enabledPlugins` to the operator's needs — add
`agent-mcp`, `agent-logger`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-containers`,
`agent-dispatch` only where a later phase or the operator calls for them.

**Restart before you rely on the new skills.** Plugins are scanned at session
**startup**, so a session that *wrote* `settings.json` does not yet have the
newly enabled skills. In greenfield/brownfield, the order is: write
`settings.json` → **restart Copilot CLI from inside the repo** → verify the
plugin skills loaded → then continue. (agent-worktrees especially only takes
effect after a restart.)

**Deploy the runtimes.** Payload registration only vendors skills/hooks; runtime
plugins also need a venv + binstub deployed once. Split by installer:

- **agent-worktrees, agent-bridge, agent-codespaces, agent-containers,
  agent-mcp** — run the **`agent-worktrees:copilot-extensions-setup`** skill ("set up copilot
  extensions"); it installs each under `~/.agent-*` with binstubs in
  `~/.local/bin`.
- **agent-logger** — deploy via its own installer / the **`session-sync-setup`**
  skill (not covered by `copilot-extensions-setup`).
- **agent-dispatch** — deploy via its own `scripts/init.*` / the
  **`agent-dispatch:agent-dispatch`** skill.
- **Payload-only** (`customizing-copilot`, `efforts`, `visions`,
  `context-handoff`) — nothing to deploy beyond being enabled.

**Done when:** `.github/copilot/settings.json` lists the chosen set, the session
has been restarted so the skills are live, `agent-worktrees --version` works,
and (if enabled) `agent-bridge version` works.

---

## Phase 3 — Adopt the harness and related repos

**Opinionated:** the harness is **adopted by agent-worktrees** (its own
worktree root + project binstub), and every **product/target repo** the harness
drives is registered as a **related** repo — not copied in.

### Adopt the harness repo

From inside the harness repo (skill: **`agent-worktrees:copilot-extensions-setup`** §2, or the
**`agent-worktrees:agent-worktrees-repos`** skill):

```bash
agent-worktrees register <harness-repo-name>
```

This writes `~/.<harness>/config.yaml`, picks a worktree root
(`<parent>/.worktrees/<harness>/`), and drops a project binstub
`~/.local/bin/<harness>` — the command that launches the Picker (Phase 6).

### Adopt related target repos

The harness *drives* other repos; it does not absorb them. For each product
repo, first make sure agent-worktrees knows the repo — register it in the
per-machine **repos registry** (skill: **`agent-worktrees:agent-worktrees-repos`**; e.g.
`agent-worktrees repos add <name> <path-or-remote>`) so `related resolve` can
report its class, path, and remote. Then use the **`agent-worktrees-related`**
skill to link it and write a **related narrative**
(`.agent-worktrees/related/<name>.md`) capturing that repo's point of view — its
class (reference / singleton / worktree), locus (local / a machine / a
codespace), and how to make a change there.

```bash
agent-worktrees related resolve <name>        # reports class, path, locus, plan
agent-worktrees related resolve <name> --json
```

Then, when acting across repos, follow the **`agent-worktrees:working-cross-repo`** skill: honor
the repo's management **class**, its **locus**, prefer **delegation** over
reaching across machines, and never hardcode a checkout path (resolve with
`agent-worktrees repos find <name>`).

> **This is the seam that keeps the harness unopinionated about the product.**
> Target repo structure, where product code lives, git/issue providers, and
> PR policy are all properties of the *related* repo, recorded in its narrative —
> not imposed by the harness.

> **Prefer a harness plugin over a hand-written narrative when one exists.** If a
> target repo ships its own `<repo>-harness` plugin (a payload-only plugin
> providing the skills to work *on* that repo — contribute + diagnose), **enable
> it** in `.github/copilot/settings.json` instead of hand-writing the operator
> guidance. Keep the local narrative/redirect thin — just the consumer-specific
> bits (which machines deploy it, adoption status). See the
> `customizing-copilot:authoring-harness-plugins` skill; `copilot-extensions-harness` is the
> reference example.

> **Reference / machine-specific / not-locally-checked-out related repos.** Not
> every related repo is a locally-editable worktree on *this* machine. A repo may
> be **reference-class** (read-only), **checked out only on another machine**, or
> a **codespace**. In those cases `agent-worktrees related resolve <name>` may
> report the repo as unknown/unavailable *here* — that is expected, not a failure.
> The Phase-3 bar is that each related repo is **registered and classified where
> it lives** (via `agent-worktrees-repos`) and its narrative records the class +
> locus; a narrative with **no registry entry on any machine** is the actual gap
> to reconcile (register it, or drop the stale narrative).

**Done when:** `<harness>` launches the Picker; each product repo either resolves
via `agent-worktrees related resolve <name>` with a concrete plan **or** is
explicitly reference-class / owned by another machine, and every narrative has a
matching registry entry somewhere.

---

## Phase 4 — `AGENTS.md` and connective-tissue skills

**Opinionated:** the plugin skills are **generic**; the harness supplies the
**connective tissue** that binds them to *this* repo. Two surfaces do that.
(Skills: **`customizing-copilot:authoring-skills`**, **`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`** from
`customizing-copilot`.)

### `AGENTS.md` — the harness's identity and rules

Author (greenfield) or reconcile (brownfield/audit) a root `AGENTS.md` that
states, concisely:

- **What this harness is** and what it drives.
- **Conventions** the harness enforces: branch/commit policy, how work is
  planned (efforts), how change is reconciled to intent (visions), and any
  **destructive-action** and **error-response** discipline the operator wants.
- **Pointers, not prose** — reference the skills below and the plugin skills
  rather than restating them. `AGENTS.md` is a table of contents with rules,
  not a manual.
- **Keep ambient guidance with its owner.** Repository identity, irreducible
  local invariants, configuration pointers, and minimal safety/publication
  fail-safes live here. Generic plugin-owned ambient policy is config-backed and
  delivered by the owning plugin through a checked-in static pointer plus an
  output-free `sessionStart` writer that renders a concise context kernel into
  that exact session's guidance file; detailed procedures live in on-demand
  skills. A one-shot skill body decays,
  but copying wholesale plugin policy into `AGENTS.md` creates a second owner.
  Follow `docs/patterns/session-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`.
- **Preserve launch-path fallbacks.** Some headless/cloud paths do not load
  plugin hooks. Keep critical static fail-safes on those paths even after
  plugin-owned injection exists.

Keep it **voice-neutral** unless the operator explicitly wants personality
(unopinionated seam #7).

### Connective-tissue skills (`.github/skills/`)

Thin, repo-local skills that stitch generic capability to local reality. Common
kinds:

- **Repo redirect / narrative pointers** — a thin trigger-skill per related
  repo that routes to its narrative (substance stays in the narrative, per
  Phase 3).
- **Machine/context skills** — one per machine the harness runs on (hardware,
  paths, local scope), loaded on demand.
- **Binding addenda** — the short efforts/visions repo addenda (Phase 7) that
  specialize the generic pattern to this repo.
- **Domain glue** — any repo-specific convention worth a trigger phrase.

Author these with the **`customizing-copilot:authoring-skills`** skill (SKILL.md frontmatter,
folder convention, validation checklist). Prefer **many small, well-triggered
skills** over one giant skill — but only add a skill when a real trigger
justifies it (mind context budget).

> **Knowledge goes into reviewable flows, not agent memory.** Conventions →
> docs + skills; invariants → an architecture/contract doc; intent → a vision;
> plans → an effort. This is what makes the harness *self-reinforcing*: the
> validation flows in Phase 8 read these files.

**Done when:** `AGENTS.md` names the harness's conventions and points at skills;
`.github/skills/` holds the connective-tissue skills the harness needs; each
passes the `authoring-skills` validation checklist.

---

## Phase 5 — SSH and agent-bridge

**Opinionated** *if* the harness spans more than one machine or wants
inter-agent sends. Single-machine, single-agent harnesses may **skip** this
phase (agent-bridge still works locally via `agent-bridge send local ...`).

### SSH mesh — aliases, never raw IPs

Use the **`agent-ssh:agent-ssh`** skill. Define a named SSH alias for every machine in the
mesh (encoding user, port, key, and any ProxyJump). **Never** put a raw IP
in an SSH command — aliases survive IP changes and off-network access.

### agent-bridge topology

Describe the mesh in your topology file (templates + guidance live in the installed
agent-bridge plugin payload / the upstream `copilot-extensions` repo at
`plugins/agent-bridge/docs/machine-config.md` — read it from there, not from the
harness):

- **`machines.yaml`** — machines, platforms, SSH aliases, roles, and
  `control_plane.project`. agent-bridge **derives** its agent roster from this
  topology (machines × repos × environments) plus each repo's
  `.copilot-extensions/agent-worktrees/related.yaml` (with legacy
  `.agent-worktrees/related.yaml` fallback); the hand-authored `acp-agents.json` is
  deprecated (honored only if a profile's `agents_config` points at one).

Then wire and start (skill: **`agent-worktrees:copilot-extensions-setup`** §3–4, or the
**`agent-bridge:agent-bridge`** skill):

```bash
agent-bridge config adopt --repo . --profile <harness>
agent-bridge service restart
agent-bridge machines && agent-bridge agents
```

**Unopinionated:** how many machines, their roles, and the execution substrate
(local / codespace / container) are the operator's — the bridge just reads what
you record.

**Done when:** `agent-bridge send local "..."` returns; and, if multi-machine,
listing `agent-bridge agents` shows the remote agent and
`agent-bridge send <agent-name> "..."` returns over SSH.

---

## Phase 6 — Validate end-to-end with the Picker

**Opinionated:** the harness is not "done" until a real session runs through the
**Picker** — the interactive worktree launcher the project binstub opens.

Launch it:

```bash
<harness>            # the project binstub from Phase 3 → opens the Picker
```

Walk one full lifecycle:

1. **Create/pick a worktree** from the Picker; confirm the session starts in an
   isolated worktree (not the anchor).
2. Confirm the **session setup script** ran (if you added one in Phase 1) and
   that plugins loaded (skills available; `agent-worktrees status`).
3. Do a trivial edit, **commit on the worktree branch**, and take it through the
   harness's chosen finalization path (unopinionated seam #5): for direct-to-
   branch, `agent-worktrees push-changes` **then** `agent-worktrees finalize`;
   for a PR flow, `agent-worktrees create-pr`, then merge/reconcile the PR, then
   `agent-worktrees finalize` to clean up.
4. If Phase 5 is active, from the session run an `agent-bridge send <agent-name>`
   (list agents with `agent-bridge agents`) to a second agent/machine and
   confirm the round-trip.

> **In Audit mode, don't side-effect.** Step 3 creates a commit/PR — appropriate
> when *building* a harness, but wrong during a read-only audit. To audit Phase 6
> without touching anything, verify the finalization path is **configured**
> instead of exercised: the session is in an isolated worktree (not the anchor),
> plugins/skills loaded, a setup script is present and ACP-safe, and the PR/branch
> policy is wired (`agent-worktrees get pr-required`, the `pr:`/hooks config) —
> no trivial commit required.

**Done when:** a worktree session launches from the Picker, plugins/skills load,
and — when building — a trivial change completes the harness's finalization path
cleanly (or, when auditing, that path is verified configured without a commit).

---

## Phase 7 — Enable efforts and visions

**Opinionated:** the harness plans work as **efforts** and steers change against
**visions**. Adopt both (payload-only plugins from Phase 2).

### efforts — the planning system

Run the **`efforts:efforts-setup`** skill ("set up efforts"): it scaffolds `efforts/`
(README index + TEMPLATE) and writes a short **repo addendum** specializing the
bindings (grouping, participants seam, archive layout). Day-to-day work uses the
**`efforts:planning-efforts`** skill. Start new planning as an **effort**, not an ad-hoc
`docs/plans/*.md`.

> **Legacy plan trees are a transitional backlog, not instant drift.** A mature
> repo often has a pre-existing `docs/plans/*.md` (or similar) tree. The Phase-7
> bar is **not** "zero legacy plans" — it is that **new** planning starts as an
> effort *and* the legacy tree is a **documented, shrinking migration backlog**
> (a README stating those docs are valid-until-promoted). An undocumented pile of
> active plans that new work keeps adding to is the real drift; a labelled
> migration backlog is acceptable.

### visions — the north-star

Run the **`visions:visions-setup`** skill ("set up visions"): it scaffolds `visions/`
(README index + TEMPLATE) and writes the repo addendum (chiefly the
organization seam). Day-to-day work uses the **`visions:envisioning`** skill. A vision is
**pure should-be**, revised in place; **efforts are carved from the delta**
between a vision and reality.

**How they steer change:** every architectural or behavioral change reconciles
to the vision — it either *closes* a stated gap (cite the vision item),
*extends* intent (revise the vision first), or is *below-altitude* (trivial;
just say so). Until the visions plugin ships equivalent ambient injection, its
setup keeps this invariant as a concise compatibility/fallback rule in
`AGENTS.md`. Visions **guide**, never **gate**.

**Done when:** `efforts/` and `visions/` exist with their addenda; `AGENTS.md`
references the reconcile-to-vision habit and the "plan as an effort" rule.

## Phase 8 — Validate skills and agents

**Opinionated:** the harness's own skills and sub-agents get **reviewed** before
they are trusted. Two tools do this. In a loaded session this whole phase is the
**`customizing-copilot:reviewing-customizations`** skill — trigger it with
"review my skills" / "rubber-duck my agents"; the steps below are what it runs.

### rubber-duck — critique the design

Use a **review sub-agent** to critique the harness's skills, sub-agent
definitions, `AGENTS.md`, and any hooks for logic gaps, ambiguous triggers,
contradictory rules, and footguns — the Copilot CLI's built-in **`rubber-duck`**
task sub-agent where available, or any equivalent reviewer the harness provides.
It reports bugs and design flaws, not style. Feed it the actual files and act on
high-signal findings.

### customizing-copilot — validate against the format

Cross-check each authored artifact against its authoring skill:

- **Skills** → **`authoring-skills`** (frontmatter, folder convention,
  trigger phrasing, validation checklist).
- **Sub-agents** → **`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`** (`.agent.md` format, tool aliases,
  bounded direct-execution contracts, per-agent MCP ownership, Task-capable
  anti-self-delegation, and the MCP-readiness pattern).
- **MCP servers** → **`registering-mcp-servers`** (registration hierarchy,
  config format, env substitution).
- **Plugin registration** → **`installing-plugins`** (repo `settings.json`,
  payload-vs-runtime, launch-time reconciliation).

Run the mechanical scan with `--from-settings` so the checked set includes
project and `.ai` agents plus the enabled external plugin agents. Owned findings
are blocking; external agent findings are origin/version-aware advisories with
an upstream fix path and never authorize editing an installed payload.

**Done when:** rubber-duck reports no high-severity issues on the harness's
skills/agents, owned artifacts conform to their `customizing-copilot` checklists,
and external advisories are either accepted, configured around, or tracked
upstream.

## Phase 9 — agent-mcp and MCP delegation

**Opinionated** *if* the harness needs authenticated MCP tools: wrap them with
**agent-mcp** and **delegate MCP handling to sub-agents** rather than loading
heavy MCP toolsets into the primary session.

### Wrap an authenticated MCP with agent-mcp

`agent-mcp` wraps an upstream MCP server (HTTP or stdio) as a local **stdio**
MCP and injects **host credentials** (Entra/`az`, `gh`, git-credential, env) —
so no PATs are baked into config. It is **standalone**: invoked directly from an
agent's `mcp-servers` config, one bridge file per server. Prefer an **in-repo**
`--config` bridge for repo-scoped servers. It owns transport/auth/catalog
mechanics; the agent contract remains in
**`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`**. (Skill:
**`agent-mcp:agent-mcp`**.)

### Delegate MCP to sub-agents

Give each MCP-backed capability its **own sub-agent** that owns that MCP server,
instead of registering many MCP tools on the primary agent. This keeps the
primary context lean, isolates credential scope, and keeps verbose service
catalogs and payloads in the domain agent. Compact shared research and
orchestration MCPs may remain with the coordinator when their results directly
support decomposition, arbitration, or task state. Define agents with the
**`customizing-copilot:defining-subagents`** skill, and honor its **MCP-readiness / anti-recursion**
pattern: a sub-agent checks its MCP tools are actually available before using
them. For an authorization-equivalent agent-mcp bridge, it records a catalog
failure and uses the same bridge's materialized CLI fleet before stopping; raw
product/API bypasses remain forbidden. If `agent-dispatch` is in the set, its MCP
surface is a natural fit for a delegated queue sub-agent.

### The primary-session exception (narrow)

Delegation targets **heavy or narrowly-scoped credentialed** MCP toolsets — the
ones that bloat context or widen credential blast-radius on the primary agent.
Two kinds of server may **legitimately load in the primary session**:

- **An always-on, broadly-useful, read-mostly server** — e.g. a **semantic-
  search / knowledge index** (VEI-style) the agent reaches for constantly. The
  friction of delegating every lookup outweighs the context saved.
- **A single low-risk host-auth server** whose credential is already the host's
  own (a git-credential/`gh`/vault-injected token) and whose tool surface is
  small.

Keep the exception **narrow and deliberate**: still wrap the server with
`agent-mcp` for host-credential injection (never a hardcoded PAT), keep its tool
list tight, and **document why** it rides in the primary session. Everything
heavier or more privileged still goes to a delegated sub-agent.

**Done when:** any authenticated MCP the harness uses is wrapped by an
`agent-mcp` bridge with host-credential injection; MCP-heavy or narrowly-
credentialed capabilities are owned by delegated sub-agents; and any server that
rides in the primary session is a **documented, narrow** exception (always-on
read-mostly, or a small low-risk host-auth surface).

## Audit mode

For a repo already wired as a harness (including by an older incarnation of this
system), run every phase's **"Done when"** as a checklist and fix drift in
place. Highest-value checks, in order:

1. **Plugin registration is repo-scoped and current** (Phase 2). Old harnesses
   often relied on global installs or a stale plugin set — migrate to
   `.github/copilot/settings.json` and trim to the
   [recommended tiers](#recommended-plugin-set).
2. **Related repos use narratives, not copies** (Phase 3). If product code or a
   full `services/`/`tools/` suite was replicated into the harness, flag it and
   propose extracting it to a related repo.
3. **Guidance ownership is coherent** (Phase 4): `AGENTS.md` is a lean map with
   repository-owned invariants/fail-safes, plugin ambient policy is injected by
   its owner where supported, and skills contain detailed procedures.
4. **efforts + visions are adopted with addenda** (Phase 7); planning lives in
   `efforts/`, not scattered `docs/plans/*.md`.
5. **SSH uses aliases, never raw IPs** (Phase 5).
6. **MCP is wrapped + delegated** (Phase 9), not a pile of raw tools on the
   primary agent.
7. **rubber-duck + customizing-copilot pass** (Phase 8).

Report findings as a prioritized list; fix the small ones in place (with atomic
commits) and surface the structural ones to the operator before acting.

## Where to go next

- [README](../README.md) — concepts, quick start, the full plugin catalog.
- [Architecture overview](architecture.md) — how the plugins fit together.
- Each plugin's `skills/` — the authoritative, always-current procedure for that
  capability. This runbook references those skills by name precisely so it stays
  thin and they stay the source of truth.
