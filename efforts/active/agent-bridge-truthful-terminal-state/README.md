## Guiding Intent

A bridge session's terminal and lifecycle state must always be **truthful**,
viewed from either direction:

1. A **running** turn must eventually reach exactly one truthful terminal
   event — it must never wedge in `running` forever because a transport
   dropped mid-turn, and it must never silently disappear without a terminal
   marker any consumer can observe.
2. A **stopped, idle, or failed** session must never falsely revive itself.
   Explicit stop is a durable state, not a request that background recovery,
   heartbeat maintenance, or a daemon restart can quietly override — while an
   explicit resume (including a later `send`) must still recover it normally.

These read as two different bug classes — a hang vs. an unwanted retry — but
they are the same missing invariant seen from opposite sides: the bridge's
notion of "is this session alive, and who decided that" must be singular and
truthful at every boundary (client disconnect, transport loss, heartbeat pass,
daemon restart, explicit stop, explicit resume). Fixing them under one effort
keeps the state-machine reasoning coherent instead of accumulating unrelated
point patches that could reintroduce each other's failure mode.

This effort does not introduce new vision language — the agent-bridge vision
already asserts `own-the-lifetime`, `reattach-never-kill`,
`drain-before-letting-go`, and `connection-loss-never-destroys-the-target`.
It closes those behaviors by making the implementation actually uphold them
across every disruption boundary, with regression coverage that pins the
truthful-state invariant down.

## Coordination

- **Topology:** land Phase A (turn continuity) and Phase B (dormancy) as
  independent, separately reviewable PR lanes — they touch different code
  paths (`AcpClient`/`SessionManager._run_prompt` vs. the reap/heartbeat/resume
  gating) and neither blocks the other.
- **Host (owns PRs):** truthful-state driver.
- **Handoff:** every phase updates this Journal with the exact PR, the
  invariant it closes, and any residual race left open for the next phase or a
  named follow-on issue. A phase is not done merely because its PR merged —
  see each phase's exit criterion below.

## Context

`#22` and the `#2445`/`#2378`/`#2379` cluster surfaced independently, from two
different incidents, but both point at the same underlying gap: the bridge's
session lifecycle has enough state (running/idle/stopped/failed, heartbeat,
recovery, explicit-stop) that its transitions were never fully specified as a
single truthful state machine. Each incident fixed (or is fixing) its own
symptom locally:

- `#22`'s fix adds a transport-lost signal that wakes the hung `prompt()`
  future and appends a terminal `session_state_changed` event so no consumer is
  left watching a phantom `running` turn.
- `#2449` (in flight) adds an explicit-stop dormancy gate checked before
  provider-availability checks run, at both heartbeat and daemon startup, so a
  `stop`ped session's host record and conversation survive but its background
  recovery does not resurrect it.

Neither fix, by itself, is wrong — but reviewing `#2449` surfaced two lifecycle
races (reap-vs-in-flight-resume lock ordering, and an unlocked
`resume_on_reattach` clear racing a concurrent redeploy) that are exactly the
class of bug this effort exists to close systematically: two code paths
independently deciding a session's liveness without one arbiter.

## Plan

### Phase A — Turn continuity (a running turn always reaches a terminal event)

- [ ] Land `#22`'s transport-lost wake signal and terminal-event append as
      this phase's first PR.
- [ ] Audit every other path that can leave `SessionManager._run_prompt` (or
      its ACP/host-mode equivalents) without appending a terminal event, and
      add the same guarantee there.
- [ ] Add a regression test that drops the transport mid-turn and asserts
      exactly one terminal event is observed by an SSE-equivalent reader,
      never zero and never more than one.

### Phase B — Explicit-stop and idle/failed dormancy (a stopped session never self-revives)

- [ ] Track `#2449` to merge as this phase's first PR, closing `#2445`.
- [ ] Close the two lifecycle races the 2026-09-11 review found still open at
      `#2449`'s reviewed head: make reap and in-flight resume mutually
      exclusive under one lock, and move `resume_on_reattach`'s clear inside
      the same lock `graceful_cancel_for_redeploy` and `stop_session` already
      use.
- [ ] Add growing backoff for sustained reconnect failure against an
      unreachable target, closing `#2378`.
- [ ] Confirm an idle session with no live ACP consumer stops retrying and
      goes dormant under the same gate `#2449` adds, with an explicit test for
      the no-consumer case, closing `#2379`.
- [ ] Add a regression test that explicitly stops a session, runs a heartbeat
      pass and a daemon restart, and asserts no reconnect/resume attempt
      occurs until an explicit resume or `send`.

### Phase C — Reconcile as one state machine (follow-on, not blocking A/B)

- [ ] Once A and B are individually green, write down the full session-state
      transition table (running/idle/stopped/failed/dormant × transport-drop /
      heartbeat / daemon-restart / explicit-stop / explicit-resume) as a single
      source of truth, so a future incident can be checked against a diagram
      instead of re-derived from code.
- [ ] Identify whether the reap-lock and resume-lock introduced in Phase B are
      the same lock used elsewhere in the session lifecycle, or whether this
      effort has now created the state machine's actual single arbiter; file a
      follow-on issue if a further consolidation is warranted.

### Bug sweep — linked open bugs (2026-09-24)

_Correlated via a facility-driven sweep of open `bug`-labeled issues against active efforts (VEI + direct review). Not yet triaged into a numbered phase — listed here as upcoming work for whoever picks this effort back up._

- [ ] **#2379** agent-bridge: let an idle session with no ACP consumer go to sleep instead of retrying indefinitely
  - An idle session retrying indefinitely instead of sleeping is directly this effort's lifetime-ownership scope.
- [ ] **#2378** agent-bridge: back off SSH/container reconnect attempts under sustained failure
  - Reconnect backoff under sustained failure is directly this effort's `connection-loss-never-destroys-the-target` behavior.
- [ ] **#2041** agent-bridge: Reattach surviving provider Session Hosts instead of recreating sessions
  - Reattaching instead of recreating is this effort's own named `reattach-never-kill` behavior, verbatim.
- [ ] **#1362** agent-bridge daemon flapping: stale active.json port mapping + failed auto-update cutovers + wedge on remote-session-host recovery
  - Daemon flapping / wedged remote-session-host recovery is the same lifecycle-truthfulness scope this effort closes.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] A running turn whose transport drops mid-turn always produces exactly
      one terminal event, never zero, never duplicated.
- [ ] An explicitly stopped session survives a heartbeat pass and a daemon
      restart without auto-resuming, retaining its host record and
      conversation for explicit resume.
- [ ] An idle or failed session with no live consumer stops retrying an
      unreachable target rather than continuing indefinitely.
- [ ] Sustained reconnect failure grows its backoff rather than retrying at a
      fixed short interval.
- [ ] Reap and in-flight resume cannot both act on the same session record;
      the loser observes a clean, explicit failure rather than corrupting
      state.
- [ ] `resume_on_reattach` cannot be left incorrectly set (or cleared) by a
      race between an ordinary stop and a concurrent redeploy/drain.
- [ ] Every new test is deterministic and does not depend on wall-clock
      timing beyond an explicitly injected fake clock or fault.

## Journal

### 2026-09-11 — Kickoff and reconciliation

- Opened [#2464](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2464)
  as the public coordination token, reconciling two previously separate
  incidents (`#22`; `#2445`/`#2378`/`#2379`) under one effort.
- Positioned `#2449` as Phase B's first implementation slice, carrying forward
  its 2026-09-11 review findings (two open lifecycle races) as this effort's
  first concrete exit-criterion gate rather than a standalone follow-up.
- Left Phase C (full state-transition table) as an explicit follow-on so
  Phases A and B can land independently without waiting on a larger
  consolidation.
