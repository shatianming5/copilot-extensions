# Agent-Dispatch Tasks Pane UX Overhaul

- **Slug:** `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260917-003059-332c` (design +
  preview tooling); implementation phases land on their own per-phase
  worktrees once the design below is approved.
- **Created:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Active — rubber-duck design review (2026-09-17) surfaced 3
  blockers around backend ownership/state contracts; resolutions agreed with
  the operator and the Plan re-sequenced below. Backend-contract phases
  (new Phase 1) must land before any UI-facing lifecycle-control phase.
- **Vision:** [`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/tasks-pane-ux`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/tasks-pane-ux/README.md)
- **Umbrella issue:** _TBD — file once the preview below is approved._
- **Sub-issues:** _TBD, one per Plan phase._

## Guiding Intent

The Worktrees pane in the Worktree Manager is a disciplined table view:
declarative columns, a state-derived colour palette shared with the status
bar, compact status markers, and a rich per-row action menu. The **Tasks**
pivot (agent-dispatch's registered pivot, rendered by `TasksView` in
`engine.py`) has none of that discipline today: no phase-based colour
grouping, no visible link to an assigned worktree's live status, no surfaced
artifacts (PRs/issues), no repo-scoped column, and a thin action menu.

This effort brings the Tasks pane to parity with Worktrees' presentation
quality, and layers on task-specific controls: steering blocked tasks,
forcing an abandon/reset, inspecting a task's charter, drilling into an
embodied task's worktree (a new Worktree Status card), and stopping/pausing
the agent embodying it. It also adds a Configuration → Registrars
viewer/editor so the operator can see every registrar/source of tasks and
flip the existing user-level enable/disable override — the master pause —
without being able to add or remove registrations (that stays an
agent-chat-driven flow).

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| operator-cloud1 (this session) | Design, grounding against real code, preview-rendering tooling, effort/vision authoring, Phase 1 implementation | `copilot-extensions.worktrees/operator-cloud1-win-20260917-003059-332c` |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase PRs once the design is approved (each
  Plan phase below is a self-contained, reviewable slice). **Phases 0-3
  landed as one combined PR (#2913)** rather than split retroactively —
  see the Journal's "single PR" decision entry; going forward, **land each
  remaining phase's implementation PR before starting the next phase** —
  do not begin the next phase's implementation while the current phase's
  PR is unopened or unlanded, unless a session explicitly journals why and
  for how long that is deferred (see `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2908`,
  filed to get upstream `efforts` guidance enforcing exactly this gate).
- **Host (owns PRs):** whichever worktree lands each phase.
- **Delegates:** none yet.
- **Handoff:** the preview tooling and captured screenshots in this worktree
  are the artifact an operator reviews before any implementation PR opens.
  Implementation work follows a **manual sequenced-session handoff loop**
  (below): a session drives the effort until its context fills, then saves
  a handoff prompt via `save_handoff_prompt` for the operator to manually
  paste into a fresh session, which reads the Runbook, picks up exactly
  where the prior session left off, and repeats.

## Runbook — for whichever session is currently driving this effort

**Read this section FIRST in any new session picking up this effort.** It is
kept up to date at the end of every session (or handoff point) so a fresh
session never has to re-derive "what's already done" from the Journal alone.

- **2026-09-30 status, update 2 (Phase 10 status-checked; a real
  prerequisite gap found and spun into a sibling effort — read this
  first):** Phases 0-8 remain COMPLETE, plus the 2026-09-29 row-shape
  standardization and the LENGTH column (this session, see the bullet
  below). Operator asked to check on Phase 10's "New task…" button;
  confirmed it's still entirely unimplemented, and investigating WHY
  surfaced that Phase 10's own Plan text had a wrong assumption baked in
  (see the new bullet added to Phase 10's section above: the
  `PivotAction`/`kind:"form"` mechanism is row-scoped by design; Worktrees'
  "+ New worktree…" is hand-coded, not a generic mechanism to mirror).
  Rather than solve this narrowly, folded it together with a second,
  related operator want (a Prompt field on "New worktree…" itself) into a
  new sibling effort:
  [`picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer`](../picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer/README.md)
  (Phase A = New-worktree Prompt field, Phase B = the generic pivot-level
  create-action Phase 10 actually needs). **Phase 10 here now explicitly
  depends on that effort's Phase B** — do not attempt Phase 10 until it
  lands. No code changed in THIS effort this update; see that sibling
  effort's own Runbook/Journal for where to pick up next (its own Phase A
  is the recommended starting point — shared groundwork, and no cross-effort
  dependency of its own).
- **2026-09-30 status (LENGTH column landed):** Phases 0-8 remain COMPLETE,
  plus the 2026-09-29 row-shape standardization. This session closed the
  operator's follow-up question ("does the T column pull from the
  worktree?") by landing a real cross-plugin fix: `agent-worktrees`' relay
  bundle gained a new
  `session_length` fact (session_count + turn_count, both already-cached
  `WorktreeRecord` fields — no new live computation), and `agent-dispatch`
  now renders it as the Tasks board's `LENGTH` column, formatted `"Ns Nt"`
  — the SAME format the (separate, not-yet-implemented) `worktrees-pivot-
  ux-overhaul` effort's own planned Worktrees LENGTH-column rename will
  use, so the two stay visually consistent once that one lands too. See
  the Journal's 2026-09-30 entry for the full design. Landed via PR #4714,
  merged.
- **2026-09-29 status, update 2 (row-shape standardization landed):**
  Phases 0-8 remain COMPLETE. Additionally landed a Phase 3 amendment this
  session: the Tasks row now uses the SAME two-line shape as Worktrees/
  CodeSpaces/Containers (columnized stats on line 1, `[tag] repo title -
  phrase` on line 2) — see Phase 3's own new checklist bullet and the
  Journal's second 2026-09-29 entry for the full design/heuristic detail.
- **2026-09-29 status (read this bullet first; everything below it in this
  section is historical and was already stale before this update — trust
  the Plan checklist's own `[x]`/`[ ]` marks over any prose here that
  disagrees):** **Phases 0-8 are now ALL COMPLETE.** Phase 7's last two
  gaps (the `charter` card, and rendering the user-pause hold as its own
  `"Paused"` phase/badge) landed this session — see the Phase 7 section
  above for the full detail and the Journal's 2026-09-29 entry. Confirmed
  via git log that PR #2913 (Phases 1-3), #2979 (Phase 4), #3222/#3234
  (Phase 5/8) are all merged into `dev`. **What's left: Phase 6 (source-repo
  filter chip, not started, unscoped), Phase 9 (Registrars viewer/editor,
  not started), Phase 10 (New Task composer, not started, zero
  dependencies), Phase 11 (Completion Review card, not started — its
  dependency, the sibling `agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state`
  effort's `confirm`/`reopen_completed`, landed via PR #3715 on 2026-09-26,
  so Phase 11 is now unblocked).** Recommended next: Phase 10 or 11 (both
  ready, no blockers) or Phase 6 (smallest scope, needs its own design
  pass on what "unscoped" repo-filter UX should look like — read that
  Phase's Plan bullet first). This worktree
  (`owner_user-cloud1-win-20260929-011101-363e`) was created fresh for the
  Phase 7 closure and has not yet been submitted as a PR as of this
  writing — check `agent-worktrees pr-status` before starting further work
  in it, and land/finalize Phase 7's own PR before mixing in a new phase's
  changes.
- **Worktree:** no single "established driving worktree" anymore — the
  Phase 4 worktree finalized after PR #2979 merged. Create a fresh worktree
  off current `main` via `agent-worktrees -p copilot-extensions create`
  when picking this up (this has been the pattern since Phase 4: land a
  phase's PR, finalize that worktree, start the next phase in a new one).
  Any such worktree carries several unrelated stash entries that pre-date
  this effort — never run `git stash pop`/`git stash apply` without an
  explicit `stash@{N}` naming the entry you intend, and never clear the
  stash list.
- **Current phase (STALE — superseded by the 2026-09-29 bullet above):**
  **Phases 0-5 and 8 are now done.** Phases 0-3 landed in
  PR #2913, Phase 4 in PR #2979, the Tasks-pivot-freeze bug was fixed via
  PRs #2932 / #2970 / #2972, and the accelerator/relay-backed Worktree Status
  + claims work landed in PRs #3222 and #3234 on 2026-09-21. The operator's
  2026-09-20 feedback items 1-2 also landed (Started now sorts ahead of
  Queued; the WT column is styled `bold cyan` so claimed worktrees read at a
  glance). Item (3) -- "every observed Started task is CLI-embodied" -- was
  investigated and closed as **not a bug**; the still-open follow-on is a real
  `embodiment_kind` backend field/badge if the operator still wants the UI
  distinction.

  **What actually remains is narrower than the stale checklist below made it
  look.** By live inspection on 2026-09-22, most of Phase 7 had already landed
  earlier: `worktree-status` already renders a real card, and the
  Pause/Unpause/Force-stop/Reset-to-Proposed/Abandon actions were already wired
  to Phase 2's real CLI verbs. The one genuine Phase 7 backend/UI gap was
  **Open into a CLI session**, because the manifest still pointed at the
  generic Worktrees `open-cli` internal verb while `board_cli.py` hard-gated
  `cli_openable` to `False`. That gap is what this session is landing now via a
  dedicated picker-side `embody-cli` internal verb that shells out to
  `agent-dispatch embody --interactive`, then exits into the resulting
  worktree's standard CLI resume flow. Two separate items still remain after
  that:
  1. the `charter` card action is **still not live** (`board_cli.py` still
     populates `has_charter = False`, so the card remains intentionally hidden);
     and
  2. the user-pause hold is wired as a control, but **not yet surfaced as its
     own distinct visible/filterable phase or badge** -- that display work was
     overspecified in the original Phase 7 bullet and is still open.
- **Build/test commands** (agent-dispatch package):
  ```powershell
  cd plugins\agent-dispatch
  uv venv .venv                                            # one-time
  uv pip install --python .venv\Scripts\python.exe -e ".[dev]"  # one-time
  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_queue.py -q      # fast, targeted
  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q                    # full suite, ~30 min on this machine
  ```
  **Current verified baseline (2026-09-22):** 3325 passed / 13 skipped / 1
  warning. The older Windows/bash `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py`
  failures noted in prior entries did **not** reproduce under the current
  `.venv` run, so do not assume they are still the ambient baseline without
  re-checking.

  **Build/test commands** (worktree-manager package):
  ```powershell
  cd worktree-manager
  uv sync --extra dev                        # one-time / when deps change
  .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q      # full suite
  ```
  **Current verified baseline (2026-09-22):** 1088 passed / 1 skipped.

  Two other tests were each independently seen to fail exactly once under
  full-suite load and pass consistently otherwise, in isolation and as
  part of their own file: `test_supervisor.py::test_requeued_task_is_not_
  double_spawned` and `test_managed_companion.py::test_real_managed_
  companion_readiness_rollback_and_stop` (a real-subprocess-startup-timeout
  test, inherently load-sensitive). Logged here as known occasional flakes,
  not real regressions, in case either recurs.
- **What's done (Phase 1, item 1 — the pause hold):**
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/queue.py` — additive
  `hold_reason`/`hold_actor`/`hold_at` columns, `TaskQueue.set_hold`/
  `clear_hold`, `_transition(..., reject_if_held=True)` wired into `resume`
  and `release_suspended`, and a `hold_reason IS NULL` gate in `claim_one`.
  5 new tests in `tests/test_queue.py` (search `test_set_hold`). Wake-
  delivery/supervisor-spawn hold gating remains unimplemented (a narrower,
  separate follow-on from item 4's fencing, which is about a stale UI row,
  not the hold gate itself) — not currently blocking any Plan item.
- **What's done (Phase 1, item 2 — auto-suspend on dead liveness),
  committed:**
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/queue_liveness.py` —
  `TaskQueue.reconcile_liveness` now classifies each held task by looking
  up its **active headless spawn reservation** (`_active_headless_handle`,
  mirroring `queue.py`'s existing `_has_headless_reservation` query): a
  `local-body:`/`fleet-body:`-prefixed handle means a headless body, probed
  directly via new `headless_local_verdict`/`headless_fleet_verdict`
  callables (defaulting to `spawn_factories._default_local_body_verdict`/
  `_default_fleet_verdict`, i.e. `embody.local_body_verdict`/
  `fleet_body_verdict` — the same direct-by-session-id probes the
  supervisor's own recovery already uses); **no** matching reservation means
  a CLI-embodied (or not-yet-identifiable) owner, still probed via the
  worktree-keyed `resolver` (`tracking.liveness_verdict`) exactly as before.
  On a confirmed-`gone` verdict: a headless body keeps the pre-existing
  requeue/dead-letter behavior UNCHANGED; a CLI-embodied `started` task is
  instead auto-transitioned to `suspended` (a `claimed`-but-not-`started`
  CLI-embodied task keeps the old requeue/dead-letter behavior too, since
  `task_state_machine.py`'s `suspend` transition is only defined from
  `started`). The suspend write clears `lease_expires_at`/`last_liveness`
  and keeps owner/owner-session identity intact (mirrors `TaskQueue
  .suspend()`) so a later `resume(..., adopt_owner_session_id=...)` — which
  item 3 now actually does — can rebind it. New `counts["suspended"]` key.
  Tests: two new ones in `test_gc.py`
  (`test_reconcile_gone_cli_embodied_task_is_suspended_not_requeued`,
  `test_reconcile_gone_headless_task_still_requeues`) plus updates to 4
  pre-existing `test_gc.py`/`test_supervisor.py` tests that used a bare
  (non-headless-tagged) claim+start or `_ok_spawn()` handle to simulate the
  generic/CLI path — those now either assert the new `suspended` outcome or
  were switched to a `local-body:`-prefixed handle to keep exercising the
  unchanged headless path (see each test's own comment for which).
- **What's done (Phase 1, item 3 — the interactive embodiment
  transaction), committed:** new module
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/interactive_embody.py` —
  `launch_interactive_embodiment(client, task_id, *, machine, ...)`. Flow:
  (1) `get`/approve-if-`proposed`; reject anything other than
  `queued`/`suspended`; (2) `reserve_spawn` + `embody
  .prepare_reusable_worktree` (the SAME resolve-or-create logic
  `Supervisor._prepare_spawn_task` uses) to create-or-reuse the worktree;
  (3) a **queued** task is `claim`ed (worktree identity, no session yet)
  BEFORE the launch — closing the real "a pool worker claims it first"
  race — while a **suspended** task (never claimable by anyone else) skips
  this and binds AFTER the launch instead, since it needs the new session
  id anyway; (4) compose the new
  `embody_prompts.interactive_worker_prompt` seed (deliberately lighter
  than `autopilot_worker_prompt`: no worker identity, no pool/recipe
  framing, non-railroaded — the agent may stop and ask the operator
  anytime, and must leave the task's state honest — complete/suspend/
  abandon — whenever the session ends, never keep working unattended); (5)
  launch via `embody.spawn_embodied_worker` (extended with a new optional
  `seed` override param — every existing call site unaffected) — the SAME
  CLI-backed `agent-worktrees embody` mechanism, no new launch primitive;
  (6) `record_spawn` the new session handle, then finalize ownership:
  `start(..., owner_session_id=<new session>)` for the queued path, or
  `resume(..., adopt_owner_session_id=<new session>, expected_generation=,
  expected_owner_session_id=)` for the suspended path (atomically rebinding
  off the stale dead session in one step). **Required a small, additive
  backend extension**: `ResumeBody`/`DispatchClient.resume()` gained a new
  `adopt_owner_session_id` field alongside the existing `adopt_session`
  (which resolves the *caller's own* current session — wrong direction for
  a transaction that resumes a task into a session it just launched but
  isn't itself running inside of); mutually exclusive with `adopt_session`,
  additive and backward-compatible.
  Failure/recovery (see the module's own docstring for the full story):
  worktree-prep failure, a lost pre-launch claim race, and any launch
  failure all release the spawn reservation (`fail_spawn`); a launch
  failure on the **queued** path additionally undoes the pre-launch claim
  (`yield_task`, `release_spawn=False`) so the task returns to `queued`
  rather than being stranded `claimed` with no session (a state item 2's
  liveness GC cannot recover — it never escalates an uncaptured
  `owner_session_id` to `gone`). The ONE edge NOT self-healed: launch
  succeeds but the follow-up start/resume bind itself fails (a resume
  generation race, or a hold discovered only at bind time) — left as a
  live, unbound session; documented as future work, not a correctness
  hazard (nothing else can claim ownership of a `suspended`/`claimed` task
  out from under it). New tests: `tests/test_interactive_embody.py` (11
  tests: fresh/proposed/suspended happy paths, ineligible-status rejection,
  claim-race, launch-failure, worktree-prep-failure, and a resume
  generation-race — all against a real `TaskQueue` with `embody`'s
  subprocess-shelling functions mocked, no real `agent-worktrees`/Copilot
  process involved).
- **What's done (Phase 1, item 4 — universal mutating-action fencing),
  committed — Phase 1 is now COMPLETE:** added a new
  `_check_expected_status(task, expected_status)` helper
  (`queue.py`) raising a uniform **"task changed; refresh and retry"**
  outcome, wired into: (a) `_transition` itself (so `abandon` and every
  other `_transition`-backed verb gets it for free, checked atomically
  inside the same transaction as the write — distinct from and
  complementary to `_transition`'s pre-existing `expected_generation`/
  `expected_owner_session_id` identity fencing, which is handoff-specific
  and does NOT bump on ordinary transitions like `suspend`/`abandon`/
  `complete`, so it alone cannot detect "the status changed since I read
  it"); (b) `abandon()` — now exposes `expected_status`,
  `expected_generation`, `expected_owner_session_id` (all pass through to
  `_transition` verbatim); (c) `set_hold`/`clear_hold` (the pause/unpause
  primitives) — `expected_status`, with `clear_hold`'s already-unheld
  idempotent no-op checked BEFORE the fence (unpausing an already-unpaused
  task satisfies the operator's intent regardless of status drift); (d)
  `submit_steer` — `expected_status`. Also threaded end-to-end through the
  coordinator (`SteerBody`/`AbandonBody` gained the new fields;
  `/tasks/{id}/steer`/`/abandon` routes pass them through) and
  `DispatchClient.steer`/`.abandon()`. `force-stop`/`reset` are Phase 2 CLI
  verbs that don't exist as queue primitives yet — nothing to fence today;
  Phase 2 should reuse `_transition`'s now-verified pattern when it lands
  them, not invent a new one. 7 new tests in `tests/test_queue.py` (search
  "item 4"). Full suite re-verified: 2851 passed / 2 pre-existing unrelated
  failed / 8 skipped — see the flake note above for the one test that
  failed once under full-suite load and passed on every other run.
- **What's next: Phase 2** (the CLI verbs — `agent-dispatch embody
  --interactive` wiring item 3's transaction to a real CLI surface,
  `pause`/`unpause` wiring `set_hold`/`clear_hold`, `force-stop`, `reset`),
  each with its own unit tests against `task_state_machine.py`'s transition
  table + Phase 1's fencing (now fully landed). See the Plan section below
  for the full Phase 2 checklist.
- **What's done — Phase 2 is now COMPLETE, committed:**
  - `agent-dispatch pause <task> --reason ... [--actor ...]` /
    `unpause <task>`: thin CLI wrappers over `client.set_hold`/`clear_hold`
    (new `DispatchClient` methods + `/tasks/{id}/hold`/`/unhold` coordinator
    routes + `HoldBody`/`UnholdBody`). `--actor` defaults to the resolved
    worktree identity, else the literal `"operator"`.
  - `agent-dispatch embody <task> --interactive [--machine] [--project]`:
    resolves this machine (via `agent-worktrees`, or `--machine`) and calls
    item 3's `launch_interactive_embodiment` directly (client-side
    orchestration, like `Supervisor` — not a coordinator HTTP route, since
    the actual `agent-worktrees`/Copilot subprocess launch has to run on
    the machine invoking the CLI). `--interactive` is currently required
    (the only implemented mode; an unattended-autopilot `embody` already
    exists via the supervisor's own spawn path under a different name).
  - `agent-dispatch force-stop <task> [--machine] [--actor]`: new module
    `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/force_stop.py`
    (`force_stop`/`ForceStopError`) — only eligible from `started` (not
    `claimed`: a claimed-not-started task never had a live session to stop;
    use `yield`/`abandon`). Best-effort session termination: a **local**
    session (same machine) via new `bridge.force_end_session` (`agent-bridge
    end <id> --force`, unconditional — distinct from the existing
    `end_worker`'s idle-gated `--if-idle`); a **fleet** one (task's
    `owner`'s machine differs from the local one) via the EXISTING
    `embody.stop_fleet_body` over the SSH mesh, no new mechanism. The state
    transition (`suspend`, now fenced by the exact status/generation/
    owner-session read at the top of the call) proceeds regardless of
    whether termination could be confirmed — the operator's actual intent
    (stop treating this task as running) is honored either way. Threaded
    `expected_status`/`expected_generation`/`expected_owner_session_id`
    through `suspend()` itself (previously had none) plus its coordinator
    route/client method, since force-stop's own fencing depends on it.
  - `agent-dispatch reset <task> [--reason]` (only `--to proposed`
    implemented, matching the Plan's own scope): a genuinely NEW
    `task_state_machine.py` transition (`reset`, `{queued, claimed,
    started, suspended} -> proposed`) plus `TaskQueue.reset()` — discards
    the current attempt's embodiment state (owner, owner-session, lease,
    activity, card/steer-block state; `_transition`'s existing `to not in
    HELD` clears activity for free) while preserving the task's identity,
    prompt, and durable goal/done_criteria/progress_log (an operator wants
    a fresh attempt at the SAME task, not to delete and recreate it).
    Not owner-gated (an operator action, like `abandon`); refuses on a
    terminal or **held** task (mirrors `resume`/`release_suspended`'s
    `reject_if_held` — clear the hold first, a reset should never silently
    override an explicit pause). Full `expected_status`/`expected_generation`/
    `expected_owner_session_id` fencing via `_transition`, reused verbatim.
    Threaded through `ResetBody`/`/tasks/{id}/reset`/`DispatchClient.reset()`.
  - **Tests:** `tests/test_force_stop.py` (6, local/fleet/no-session/
    ineligible-status/termination-failure-still-suspends), 9 new
    `test_queue.py` tests for `reset` (goal/progress-log preservation,
    every legal from-state, terminal/held refusal, both fencing
    dimensions), 2 new `test_coordinator.py` tests each for hold/unhold and
    reset, and CLI-layer tests in `test_cli.py` for all four verbs
    (`pause`/`unpause`, `embody --interactive` success + error + missing-
    machine, `force-stop` success + error, `reset` success + unsupported
    `--to`).
  - **Validated:** full suite **2879 passed / 2 pre-existing unrelated
    failed / 8 skipped** — see the flake note above for the two
    load-sensitive tests seen to fail once each and pass on every other
    run/isolation.
- **What's done — Phase 3 (task schema + column contract), committed
  (mostly — one item deferred, see below):**
  - Landed the declarative `columns` on the REAL
    `plugins/agent-dispatch/pivots/agent-dispatch.json` (a pre-existing,
    simpler manifest predating this effort — replaced with Phase 0's
    proposed design, now that the actions it references are actually
    implemented: dropped every "PROPOSED — not yet implemented" disclaimer
    from `open-cli`/`pause`/`force-stop`/`reset-proposed`'s descriptions).
    Every column carries an explicit `priority` (lower = harder to drop):
    `title=1` (flex), `id=2`, `group/PHASE=3`, `target_worktree/WT=4`,
    `wt_live/LIVE=5`, `repo_name/REPO=6`, `turn_count/T=7`,
    `artifacts_summary/ARTIFACTS=8` (drops first — least valuable while
    it's still a placeholder, see below).
  - `board_cli.py`'s `_build()` now computes `wt_live` and
    `artifacts_summary` per row. **Design call (confirmed with the
    operator):** `wt_live` reuses the row's already-computed `activity`/
    `activity_updated_at` (a headless body's own `set_activity` self-report)
    rather than a fresh subprocess/bridge probe — this board client is
    stdlib-only and re-runs on every Picker refresh, so a per-row liveness
    probe was explicitly ruled out. Renders `"active"` / `"stalled Nm"`, or
    `None` (blank) when there's no headless signal -- **including for a
    CLI-embodied task**, which never calls `set_activity`. A blank `wt_live`
    cell is therefore "no headless liveness signal available here," not a
    confirmed "not live" — a caveat worth remembering when Phase 8 builds
    the Worktree Status card's own richer liveness view.
    `artifacts_summary` is landed as an explicit **placeholder** (always
    `None`) — Phase 3 owns only the column plumbing; Phase 5 owns the real
    claims/artifacts-tracking computation (per the Plan's own note that the
    two phases must not both claim this field).
  - **Landed (this session) — the deferred "+N more" column-drop
    indicator, Phase 3 is now COMPLETE:** `worktree-manager`'s shared
    `picker_tui/engine.py` (`_column_header`) gained an optional `dropped`
    param -- a compact right-aligned `+N` rendered at the end of the
    column-header row when `dropped > 0` and there's spare width (silently
    omitted otherwise, never wraps the header). The build-data call site
    computes `dropped = len(reg.columns) - len(cols)` from
    `_fitted_columns`'s already-fitted result and threads it through --
    infra shared by every registered pivot (Tasks, CodeSpaces, ...), not
    Tasks-specific. New tests in
    `worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_picker_tui.py`:
    `test_fitted_columns_drops_low_priority_when_narrow` (the column-fit
    algorithm itself, direct unit test against a `SimpleNamespace` `reg`)
    and `test_column_header_renders_dropped_count_indicator` (the `+N`
    indicator renders, fills the full row width, and is omitted rather
    than wrapped when there's no spare width) -- both resolve the render
    holder class by shape, matching `test_banner_line_helper_levels`'s
    existing pattern rather than hardcoding a class name.
  - **Tests:** `tests/test_board_cli.py` gained 2 new tests
    (`test_build_wt_live_reflects_headless_activity_only`,
    `test_build_artifacts_summary_is_a_phase3_placeholder`); updated
    `test_cli.py`'s existing manifest-badges test to read the new columns
    without breaking (the pre-existing `badges` declaration was left
    untouched — this phase never touched it, table columns are additive).
  - **Validated:** full suite **2880 passed / 2 pre-existing unrelated
    failed / 8 skipped** (plus the same `test_supervisor.py::
    test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned` occasional flake, confirmed
    passing in isolation again). `worktree-manager`'s
    `tests/production_picker` suite: **557 passed / 1 skipped** (baseline
    unchanged) after the `_column_header`/`_fitted_columns` change.
- **Handoff protocol:** when this session's context is filling and there's
  a natural stopping point, call `generate_handoff_prompt` (with a summary
  + next_steps) then `save_handoff_prompt`, update THIS Runbook section
  with the new current position before ending the turn, and commit. The
  operator manually pastes the returned handoff prompt into a fresh session
  to continue the loop — do not rely on an automatic cutover for this
  effort.

## Context

- **Tasks today (`engine.py::TasksView`, `tasks.py`):** the pivot is a
  `RegisteredPivotRuntime`-backed, declarative-columns render (`reg.columns`,
  `reg.group_field`, `reg.badge_fields`, `reg.subtitle_field`). Rows are plain
  dicts from the provider; `group_field` already sections rows by phase
  (`entry.group`, matching `agent-dispatch-board`'s Blocked/Proposed/Queued/
  Started/Suspended/Completed/Abandoned), and `_palette_style(col.palette,
  val)` already exists for per-value cell colouring — the mechanism existed,
  it was just never populated with a task-shaped palette.
- **Worktrees today (`engine.py::WorktreesView`, `derive.py`):** state is
  derived once per row into a canonical label (ACTIVE/FINAL/MERGED/etc,
  mirroring the PSMux/TMux status segment's `_SEGMENT_STYLE`), then coloured
  via `C_STATE`. This is the palette the new `task_phase` palette (added
  this session, see Plan Phase 1) reuses colour-for-colour without touching
  `C_STATE`/`_STATE_PALETTE` itself.
- **Task lifecycle (`agent_dispatch/task_state_machine.py`,
  `agent_dispatch/board_cli.py`):** the authoritative phase vocabulary is
  `agent-dispatch-board`'s `GROUPS` — Blocked, Proposed, Queued, Started,
  Suspended, Completed, Abandoned (`_group()` projects the raw `Status`
  enum + `awaiting_steer` onto these). The Tasks pivot manifest's
  `entry.group` already carries this; this effort's palette colours it.
- **Worktree cross-link:** `RegisteredPivot.worktree_field` (manifest key
  `entry.worktree`, defaulting to `target_worktree`) already exists and is
  already used for the account-scoped claim correlation
  (`_enrich_pivot_rows`). This effort's contribution is *displaying* that
  field as a real column, not inventing the join.
- **Read-only card views:** `kind:"card"` actions (`PivotCardScreen`,
  `pivots.py`'s `_classify`/`resolve_path`) already exist and were built for
  a different steering-adjacent use case, but are schema-generic
  (`title_from`/`status_from`/`link_from`/`body_from` dotted paths against
  the entry). This effort reuses them unmodified for the charter viewer and
  the new Worktree Status card — **no new modal class needed.**
- **Registrar configuration (`agent_dispatch/registrar.py`,
  `agent_dispatch/overrides.py`):** `ProfileDeclaration` already carries
  name/kind/description/owner/source_path/plugin_root/concurrency/
  max_attempts/verify_timeout/etc — everything the Configuration →
  Registrars view needs to show. `overrides.py`'s
  `set_override`/`clear_override`/`overridden_off_ids` is the existing
  user-level enable/disable store the new UI reads/writes — not a new
  persistence layer.

## Plan

### Phase 0 — Design + review-ready previews (this worktree)
- [x] Ground the schema against the real code (`task_state_machine.py`,
      `board_cli.py`, `registrar.py`, `overrides.py`).
- [x] Add a `task_phase` palette to `engine.py` reusing `C_STATE` colours
      (Proposed/Queued → UNUSED grey, Started → ACTIVE blue, Blocked → WIP
      amber, Suspended → CONVO teal, Completed → FINAL green, Abandoned →
      GONE dark grey).
- [x] Build a hermetic preview tool
      (`worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/tasks-preview/`) that drives
      the REAL `PickerApp`/`TasksView`/`TaskMenuScreen`/`PivotCardScreen`
      against a fixed demo fleet and a **proposed** pivot manifest
      (`agent-dispatch.proposed.json`), and captures real screenshots:
      the redesigned Tasks table, the task action menu for every phase, the
      charter viewer, the Worktree Status card, and the existing steer modal
      reused with a task-shaped card. See `tasks-preview/README.md` for how
      to rerun it.
- [x] **Operator feedback round 1 (2026-09-17):** "Open into a CLI session"
      must not be offered for an embodied task with a LIVE headless agent
      (Blocked/Started — CLI and ACP can't co-drive one session), and
      ideally not for a Queued task already claimed by a pool. Fixed in the
      preview via a board-computed `cli_openable` gate (true only for
      Proposed / Queued-with-no-pool / Suspended); the manifest's `when`
      stays a flat `{"cli_openable": "true"}` equality check rather than
      encoding the branch-conditional rule declaratively. Also specified:
      the CLI session must launch with `--interactive` and a succinct
      prompt giving the agent the task's charter/phase, framed so the agent
      keeps driving the task toward its next phase while the *operator*
      decides when to wrap up — and when they do, the agent's job is to
      leave the task's recorded state honest (complete/abandon/reset-to-
      proposed/re-queue), never to keep working unattended after the
      session ends. Captured against Blocked/Started (excluded),
      Suspended/Proposed (included), and Queued+pooled (excluded) rows to
      demonstrate the full rule matrix.
- [x] **Operator feedback round 2 (2026-09-17):** the Tasks table line-wrapped
      (declared column widths summed wider than the render viewport), and
      separately, ANY full list rebuild reset scroll to the top — the second
      bug landing hardest on Tasks, since its background poll tick
      (`_maybe_repoll_pivot`) triggers a full rebuild independent of operator
      input, so scrolling down to a task near the bottom kept getting bumped
      back up. Both are **real `engine.py` fixes** (not preview-only),
      already committed in this worktree and covered by the full existing
      test suite (883 passed):
      - Added `Column.priority` (`pivots.py` + `plugin_contracts.py`) and a
        `TasksView._fitted_columns()` helper that runs the pivot's declared
        `columns` through the SAME `fit()` drop/shrink algorithm the
        Worktrees list already uses, so a declarative pivot's row can never
        exceed its render width. Wired into `_column_header`/`_column_row`/
        `build_data`. Verified at both a narrow (118-col, graceful
        column-drop) and a realistic (160-col, all columns shown) capture
        width.
      - `_PickerNativeData._rebuild()` now captures the OptionList's scroll
        offset before `clear_options()` and restores it after, instead of
        leaving every full rebuild at scroll-top. This is a general
        `OptionList`-backed list fix, not Tasks-specific — it benefits any
        pivot's full rebuild, though `_try_selection_repaint`'s existing
        O(delta) in-place path (Worktrees cursor moves only) still avoids
        even needing it for that one case.
- [ ] Operator review of the captured previews; iterate the manifest/palette
      before any implementation PR.
- [x] **Rubber-duck design review (2026-09-17)** — see the dedicated Journal
      entry below for the full review and the operator's resolutions. Net
      effect: the Plan below is re-sequenced so backend ownership/liveness/
      state contracts land BEFORE any phase that wires a lifecycle control
      (CLI-open, pause, force-stop, reset) to them. The display-only work
      (palette, columns, column-fit, charter/worktree-status cards, steer)
      is unaffected and can proceed independently.

### Phase 1 — Backend ownership/liveness/state contracts (NEW — blocking)
This phase produces no picker UI; it is the ground truth every later
lifecycle-control phase (7) reads from. Nothing in Phase 7 is implementable
without it.

- [ ] **Liveness-based `cli_openable`, not a `group`/status projection.**
      Define one backend-owned eligibility predicate over: raw task
      `Status`, whether an active spawn reservation/session exists, that
      session's actual liveness (heartbeat/lease), worktree availability,
      pool assignment, and any user hold (below). Return both a boolean and
      a machine-readable reason a UI can show. Per the operator: a Started
      (or Blocked) task IS eligible in principle if its live session (CLI
      or headless) has actually terminated — the correctness fix is not
      "special-case CLI-embodied Started tasks" but **the coordinator must
      never let that state persist**: any task whose active session/lease
      is found dead is auto-transitioned to Suspended (see next item) as
      part of normal liveness reconciliation, the same reconciliation that
      already exists for other stale-lease classes
      (`reconcile_reserving`/Phase 9 of `review-automation-reliability`).
      Once that invariant holds, `board_cli.py` computing `cli_openable`
      from the projected group (Proposed/Queued-no-pool/Suspended) is a
      correct, cheap approximation — not a shortcut around the real check.
- [x] **Auto-transition to Suspended on detected loss of liveness.** Extend
      whatever reconciliation loop already detects a dead
      reservation/session (`agent_dispatch/queue.py`) to cover a CLI-embodied
      session too (not just headless), transitioning the task to `SUSPENDED`
      the moment its active session is confirmed gone — never leaving
      Started/Blocked with no live owner. This is the invariant Phase 1's
      `cli_openable` approximation depends on. **Landed 2026-09-18** — see
      the detailed entry below (same item, checked there too).
- [x] **The "interactive embodiment transaction."** A new, coordinator-owned,
      atomic operation (not a picker navigation verb) that:
      1. Creates a new worktree if the task has none, else selects/resumes
         its existing worktree.
      2. Binds that worktree to the task and auto-claims the task to it
         (the SAME ownership/generation/CAS fencing a normal pool claim
         uses — ownership must be unambiguous either way, so a concurrent
         pool claim on the same task can never race this).
      3. Composes and returns the succinct `--interactive` seed prompt: the
         task's charter + current phase + its state-management tooling. The
         agent is told to set to work toward the task's next phase, but —
         being explicitly non-railroaded (no worker identity/pool rails) —
         may pause and ask the operator directly for instructions at any
         point; this is expected, not an escape hatch.
      Never resolves a pool or a named worker identity
      (`worker_identities.py`) at any point in this transaction — see the
      existing "never route CLI-open through the pool or a worker identity"
      requirement, now anchored to a concrete transaction rather than a bare
      picker verb. Define the failure/recovery story explicitly: worktree
      created but owner-bind fails; owner bound but the picker/launcher exits
      before the session actually starts.
      **Landed 2026-09-18** in `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/
      interactive_embody.py` (`launch_interactive_embodiment`) — see the
      Runbook above for the full design (bind-before-launch for a queued
      task's real claim race, bind-after-launch for a suspended task's
      atomic session-adopt, and the failure/recovery story per case). Needed
      one small additive backend extension: `ResumeBody`/`DispatchClient
      .resume()` gained an explicit `adopt_owner_session_id` field (the
      existing `adopt_session` boolean resolves the CALLER's own current
      session, the wrong direction for this transaction). 11 new tests in
      `tests/test_interactive_embody.py`; full suite re-verified with no
      regressions.
- [x] **A real, durable per-task user-pause hold — not `overrides.py` and
      not undifferentiated `Suspended`.** `overrides.py` disables a
      registrar/pool machine-wide, not one task; existing `Suspended` is a
      system-recoverable hold that normal resume/recovery paths already
      reopen. Add an explicit hold record (actor, reason, timestamp,
      expected generation/owner) that is a **gate every part of the flow
      must check and honor**: claim, resume, wake-delivery, liveness
      recovery/auto-transition (above), release, and supervisor spawning.
      Force-stop is a separate, narrower primitive: terminate the exact
      current reservation/session; it does not itself imply or require a
      hold. Render the hold's reason distinctly from system-Suspended and
      from Blocked/awaiting-steer in the UI (Phase 7) — three visually
      distinct situations, not one overloaded label.
      **Landed 2026-09-17** in `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/
      queue.py`: additive `hold_reason`/`hold_actor`/`hold_at` columns
      (`_COLUMNS` + `Task` dataclass — automatically included in
      `_TASK_DB_COLUMNS`/`_TASK_SELECT` since those derive from
      `dataclasses.fields(Task)`), `TaskQueue.set_hold`/`clear_hold`
      (transactional, idempotent, audited, refuses on a terminal task), a
      new `_transition(..., reject_if_held=True)` parameter wired into
      `resume` and `release_suspended`, and a `hold_reason IS NULL` gate
      added to `claim_one`'s eligibility query (both the targeted-`task_id`
      and general-scan branches). 5 new tests in `tests/test_queue.py`
      (`test_set_hold_*`); full existing suite re-verified with no
      regressions. **Not yet done:** wake-delivery and supervisor-spawn
      gating (`queue_liveness.py`/`supervisor.py`) still need their own
      hold check — see the Runbook below for exactly where.
- [x] **Auto-transition to Suspended on detected loss of liveness** —
      **Landed 2026-09-18** in `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/
      queue_liveness.py`: `LivenessMixin.reconcile_liveness` now classifies
      each held task by its active spawn reservation
      (`_active_headless_handle`, mirroring `queue.py`'s existing
      `_has_headless_reservation`): a `local-body:`/`fleet-body:`-prefixed
      handle is a headless body, probed directly by session id via new
      `headless_local_verdict`/`headless_fleet_verdict` callables
      (defaulting to `embody.local_body_verdict`/`fleet_body_verdict` —
      the supervisor's own existing direct body-liveness probes, no new
      vocabulary); no matching reservation means a CLI-embodied (or
      not-yet-identifiable) owner, still probed via the pre-existing
      worktree-keyed `tracking.liveness_verdict`. On confirmed-`gone`: a
      headless body keeps the pre-existing requeue/dead-letter behavior
      UNCHANGED; a CLI-embodied `started` task auto-transitions to
      `suspended` instead (a `claimed`-but-not-`started` CLI-embodied task
      keeps the old requeue/dead-letter behavior, since `suspend` is only a
      legal transition from `started`). The write clears
      `lease_expires_at`/`last_liveness`, keeps owner/owner-session identity
      (mirrors `TaskQueue.suspend()`) so a later `resume(...,
      adopt_owner_session_id=...)` — e.g. item 3's interactive-embodiment
      transaction — can rebind it, and preserves the existing
      generation/owner-session CAS fencing exactly. 2 new tests in
      `test_gc.py`; 4 pre-existing `test_gc.py`/`test_supervisor.py` tests
      updated (see the Runbook for which and why). Full suite re-verified:
      2835 passed / 2 pre-existing-unrelated failed / 8 skipped, no
      regressions.
- [x] Every mutating action (steer submit, abandon, reset, pause, force-stop,
      the interactive-embodiment transaction) must accept and check an
      expected status/generation/owner/owner-session — reject with a clear
      "task changed; refresh and retry" outcome on mismatch, since the
      Picker's action menu is built from a cached row that can be stale by
      the time the operator commits to an action. **Landed 2026-09-18** —
      see the Runbook above for the full design (a new
      `_check_expected_status` helper wired into `_transition` itself, plus
      `abandon`/`set_hold`/`clear_hold`/`submit_steer`, and threaded through
      the coordinator + `DispatchClient`). `reset`/`force-stop` don't exist
      as queue primitives yet (Phase 2 CLI verbs) — nothing to fence there
      today; item 3's interactive-embodiment transaction already fences its
      own `resume`/`start` calls (see its own module docstring). Phase 1 is
      now complete.

### Phase 2 — Coordinator APIs implementing Phase 1's contracts (COMPLETE, 2026-09-18)
- [x] `agent-dispatch embody --interactive` (or equivalent): runs the Phase 1
      interactive-embodiment transaction and prints/launches the seed.
- [x] `agent-dispatch pause <task> --reason ...` / `agent-dispatch unpause
      <task>`: sets/clears the Phase 1 user-pause hold.
- [x] `agent-dispatch force-stop <task>`: terminates the exact current
      reservation/session (fenced by generation/owner, per Phase 1's last
      item).
- [x] `agent-dispatch reset <task> --to proposed`: the gentler
      "not like this" — validated against `task_state_machine.py`'s
      transition table.
- [x] Unit tests for all four against the state machine + the Phase 1
      concurrency fencing (a stale caller must be rejected, not silently
      succeed against the wrong incarnation of the task).

  See the Runbook above for the full design/implementation summary of each
  verb, the files touched, and the exact test counts.

### Phase 3 — Task schema + column contract (display-only; UNBLOCKED)
- [x] The `task_phase` palette, `Column.priority`, and the column-fit wiring
      (`TasksView._fitted_columns`) are already landed in this worktree
      (generic `worktree-manager`/`agent-worktrees` engine code, usable by
      any registered pivot) — they ship with whichever PR lands this phase,
      not as a separate change.
- [x] Land the declarative `columns` on the real
      `plugins/agent-dispatch/pivots/agent-dispatch.json` manifest (ID,
      PHASE, REPO, TITLE, WT, T, LIVE, ARTIFACTS), sourced from
      `agent-dispatch-board`'s actual row shape — add `wt_live` /
      `artifacts_summary` fields to `board_cli.py`'s `_build()` (owned here
      only; Phase 5 below does NOT also claim `artifacts_summary` — see the
      rubber-duck finding about the two phases contradicting each other).
      **Landed 2026-09-18** — see the Runbook above for the confirmed
      `wt_live` data-source design (reuses `activity`/`activity_updated_at`,
      never a fresh subprocess probe) and `artifacts_summary`'s explicit
      placeholder status pending Phase 5.
- [x] Give every declared column an explicit `priority` rather than relying
      on the declaration-order default. **Landed 2026-09-18** alongside the
      manifest above.
- [x] Add a compact "+like `N more…`" affordance (or a minimal always-shown
      artifact-count glyph) when a column is dropped at a narrow width — an
      operator must be able to tell "no artifacts" from "artifacts column
      unavailable here," per the rubber-duck's column-drop finding.
      **Landed** — see the Runbook above (Phase 3 is now fully complete).
- [x] **Row-shape standardization (2026-09-29, operator feedback).**
      Standardize the Tasks row on the SAME two-line shape Worktrees/
      CodeSpaces/Containers already use: line 1 (`columns`) stays pure
      columnized stats (`ID`, `PHASE`, `WT`, `LIVE`, `T`, trailing
      `ARTIFACTS`/claims); the title, repo, and an activity phrase move to
      line 2 (the manifest's `entry.subtitle`, a single composed field per
      `_column_subtitle`'s existing generic mechanism — no engine change
      needed). `TITLE`/`REPO` dropped from `columns` entirely. New
      `board_cli._subtitle_for_task()` composes
      `[tag] <repo> <title> - <phrase>` (tag/repo each optional): `_tag`
      mirrors Worktrees' own `[system]`/`[delegate]`/`[acp]` title-prefix
      convention (`derive.norm`) — only the NON-default interface gets a
      mark, so a `"cli"` tag appears only for a heuristically CLI-embodied
      task (owned + live but no headless `wt_live` signal), never for the
      default headless/pool case. `_activity_phrase()` supplies the phrase:
      a real `wt_live` signal always wins; otherwise a hold reason
      (truncated), awaiting-steer, or the raw lifecycle status supplies a
      sensible fallback. This is the SAME heuristic ambiguity `wt_live`
      itself already carries (a blank/CLI-guessed tag means "no headless
      signal", not a hard guarantee) — a real `embodiment_kind` backend
      field remains the noted, still-open follow-on if the operator wants
      it made authoritative.
- [x] **LENGTH column: a real turn/session counter, pulled from the
      claiming worktree (2026-09-30, operator feedback).** The `T`/
      `turn_count` column had been declared in the manifest since Phase 3
      but nothing ever populated it — a genuine, silently-blank gap found
      by the operator asking "do tasks have their own turn counter, or is
      it pulled from the worktree?" Answer: neither, until now. Landed as a
      real cross-plugin fix: `agent-worktrees`' `worktree_status_compute
      .compute()` gained a new `session_length` relay fact
      (`{"session_count": ..., "turn_count": ...}`, sourced from the
      already-cached `WorktreeRecord.sessions`/`.session_turns` — no new
      live computation, always `confirmed: True`) alongside its existing
      git_state/liveness/lineage/claims/disposition facts. `agent-dispatch`
      renders it via a new `worktree_status_relay._length_display()`,
      formatted `"<session_count>s <turn_count>t"` (e.g. `"3s 25t"`) —
      deliberately the SAME unit-suffixed format the (separate,
      not-yet-implemented) `worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul` effort's own
      2026-09-29 Journal entry records as the PLANNED replacement for
      Worktrees' own `SESS/T` column (currently `"1/25"`) — so the two
      panes read consistently once that rename lands too, without this
      effort needing to touch Worktrees' own column at all. The manifest's
      `turn_count`/`T` column became `length_display`/`LENGTH`. Blank
      (never a fabricated `"0s 0t"`) when there is no claiming worktree, the
      relay entry is stale, or the fact is missing/unconfirmed — mirrors
      `wt_live`'s own "blank means no signal, not confirmed absence"
      contract.

### Phase 4 — Worktree cross-link
- [x] Confirm the WT column round-trips against a live coordinator (not just
      the preview's fixed fleet). **Found a real bug, not a clean
      confirmation** (see the Journal entry below): the real
      `agent-dispatch-board` emits the claiming worktree's FULL id in
      `target_worktree` (~30+ chars), not the demo fixture's already-4-char
      ids -- the generic per-cell `_clip` truncates from the FRONT, so the
      WT column rendered a meaningless prefix fragment instead of the
      vision's promised "claiming worktree's 4-digit id". Fixed in
      `engine.py` (`_enrich_pivot_rows` now fills a non-destructive
      `_worktree_short` trailing-4-char field; `_column_row` renders the
      `worktree_field` column from it) -- landed, not "beyond Phase 3" as
      originally scoped, but a correctness fix to what Phase 3 shipped.
- [x] Decide and scope the vision's promised REVERSE projection (task
      identity/phase visible from the Worktrees side). **Operator decision:
      implement now, as part of Phase 4** (not deferred to a later phase,
      and not narrowing the vision to one-way). Landed: a new
      `PickerScreen._worktree_claiming_task(rec)` scans every registered
      pivot with a `worktree_field` for a cached row whose value matches
      this worktree row's id/id4 (read-only against already-cached data,
      never triggers a fetch); `WorktreesView._detail_line` renders a
      compact `` · <Phase>`` badge (same `task_phase` palette the Tasks
      pivot's PHASE column uses) when a match is found, silently omitted
      for an unclaimed worktree. Phase 4 is now COMPLETE — see the Journal
      entry below.

### Bug (FIXED) — navigating into the Tasks pivot froze the Picker UI
Reported by the operator 2026-09-18 (during PR #2913 review triage). Root
cause confirmed and fixed 2026-09-19 (see the Journal entry below for the
investigation/profiling detail and the exact commit). Summary: the *first*
switch onto a registered pivot (e.g. Tasks) triggered `_machine_key_map`'s
lazily-imported `data_ssh` module (and `_pivot_runtime`'s `tasks` module) —
a real, synchronous multi-module import — directly on the render/key-handling
thread, profiled at roughly 40% of total switch latency on a cold import
cache. Fixed by warming both modules from the existing background
pivot-scan thread (`_setup_live_pivots`) instead, via a new
`tasks.prewarm_optional_modules()`.

**Known residual (accepted, not pursued further):** for the real live-session
startup path, `_setup_live_pivots` calls `prewarm_optional_modules()` directly
in its own already-background thread, so the import reliably completes before
pivots are installed/activated — no race. The shared `setup()` path (non-live
mount, and the manual `'r'` reload — both of which run synchronously on the
render/key-handling thread either way) wraps the same call in its own worker
thread instead, since it's reachable from the UI thread; this closes the
`data_ssh` cost there too, but `setup()` still imports the small, stdlib-only
`tasks` module itself before spawning that thread, and a keypress landing
exactly during that reload's async warm-up could still block briefly on
Python's per-module import lock. Both edges are narrow, cheap, and far below
the original bug's severity (a guaranteed ~100ms hit on literally the first
Tasks switch every session) — not chased further given three rounds of
otherwise-resolved PR review feedback on this exact trade-off.

**Follow-up (2026-09-19, same day) — ordering fix, separate from the accepted
residual above.** The operator reported the freeze again after this fix had
already landed. Investigation (including a direct timing probe with a
deliberately slow fixture `list` command, which did NOT reproduce a hang —
confirming `RegisteredPivotRuntime.ensure`/`.repoll` remain correctly async,
same conclusion as the original profiling) found both `setup()` and
`_setup_live_pivots` ran the (potentially slow, synchronous-on-its-caller)
pivot-registry scan **before** starting the `prewarm_optional_modules` thread
— not the tiny stdlib-only `tasks` import the residual note above accepted,
but the FULL scan (manifest materialize/classify/`resolve_active_plugins()`)
gating the prewarm's own start. So the prewarm thread only began once the
scan had already finished, shrinking (rather than maximizing) its head start
over the operator's next keypress — which, immediately after a mount/reload
finally unblocks input, is often the very next thing that happens. Fixed by
reordering both call sites so `prewarm_optional_modules` is kicked off (or,
in `_setup_live_pivots`, called directly, since that method is already
off-thread) as the very first statement, before the scan. Regression tests
(`test_setup_prewarm_starts_before_the_pivot_scan`,
`test_setup_live_pivots_prewarm_starts_before_the_pivot_scan` in
`test_picker_first_paint.py`) assert the ordering directly so a future edit
can't silently reintroduce it. This is additive to, not a re-litigation of,
the accepted residual above (which remains about the negligible `tasks`
import cost, not the scan).

**Follow-up 2 (2026-09-19, same day) — the real closure: `_machine_key_map()`
now never blocks, period.** The operator then measured the freeze directly
at ~7 seconds -- far beyond what the ordering fix's import-lock race alone
could explain. Root cause: `_machine_key_map()`'s underlying
`data_ssh.machine_key_map()` -> `agent_worktrees.config.load_config()` call
is completely uncached at that layer, and on the operator's real machine
(many registered repos; `load_config()`'s control-plane related-PR discovery
walks every one of their anchors) took 2-8+ seconds on EVERY call. Neither
prior fix touched this: `prewarm_optional_modules` only warms the `data_ssh`
*module import*, not this *function's computed result*. Fixed properly this
time: `_machine_key_map()` no longer calls `data_ssh.machine_key_map()`
directly at all -- it returns the cached map once resolved, or `{}`
immediately while unresolved (every caller already tolerates and documents
this exact display-name fallback as harmless). A new
`_prewarm_machine_key_map()` computes the real map on its own background
thread and installs it (triggering a repaint) once it lands; `setup()`,
`_setup_live_pivots`, and `_machine_key_map()` itself (as a safety net) all
call it. Verified end-to-end on the operator's own real environment: the
call now returns in 0.0000s on the exact machine that previously took 7+
seconds. See the Journal entry below for the full investigation, and
`worktree-manager-control-plane`'s Phase 3c doc for why the pivot-registry
scan itself (a separate, still-open blocking-I/O gap) is tracked there
rather than folded into this bug.

### Findings (filed, unscheduled) — operator feedback on the live Phase 0-4 UX
Reported by the operator 2026-09-20, live-driving the real Tasks pane for the
first time since Phase 4 landed.

1. **Swap the Started/Queued section order — LANDED 2026-09-20.**
   `board_cli.py`'s `GROUPS` tuple and `__main__.py`'s byte-identical
   `_BOARD_GROUPS`/`_board_group`/`_board_sort_key` both reordered to put
   Started right after Blocked/Proposed. Order-sensitive assertions in
   `test_cli.py` (`test_sort_orders_by_group_priority`) and the manifest
   badge test updated to match.
2. **Hard to tell at a glance which Started tasks have an assigned
   worktree — LANDED 2026-09-20.** First attempt added a `wt_badge` field
   wired into the pivot manifest's `badges` list — but Copilot's PR review
   caught that this pivot declares `columns` (table mode), where
   `engine.py`'s `build_data` never reads `entry.badges`/`badge_fields` at
   all (that path is table-mode-vs-list-mode mutually exclusive). Fixed
   instead by giving the existing WT column its own `"style": "bold cyan"`
   in the manifest, which the table-render path (`_column_row`) does
   apply per cell — so a populated WT id now reads distinctly at a glance,
   with no board_cli/engine.py change needed.
3. **Investigate: every observed "Started" task is CLI-embodied; NONE are
   headless-worker-embodied — INVESTIGATED 2026-09-20, closed as NOT a bug.**
   Live-coordinator evidence (`agent-dispatch reservations list` /
   `agent-dispatch show` against this machine's real coordinator):
   headless (`local-body:`) spawn reservations exist for two real
   review-inbox tasks and both had reached `started` in the past, but at
   the moment of inspection one had cycled to `queued` (its headless body
   was found `gone` by `reconcile_liveness` and requeued) and the other to
   `suspended` (a card was posted, which atomically suspends per
   `set_card`'s own docstring). Meanwhile every task actually observed in
   `started` at that moment was an operator-driven CLI/interactive
   session, which has no automatic state-cycling and stays `started` for
   the whole life of the worktree session. This is a genuine, expected
   **timing/snapshot effect** (headless bodies churn through `started`
   quickly; CLI sessions linger there), not evidence of a broken
   headless-spawn path.

   The follow-on UI need (surfacing CLI-vs-headless-vs-unknown as its own
   badge, addressing item 2's legibility goal too) is **still open** and is
   real backend work, not a quick board-side computation: `board_cli.py`
   only sees the coordinator's `/tasks` list response, which carries no
   per-task spawn-reservation signal today (`queue_liveness.py`'s
   `_active_headless_handle` is computed only inside
   `reconcile_liveness`'s own GC pass and is never persisted to the task
   row or exposed over the API). Landing the badge needs a new
   `embodiment_kind` (or similar) field computed at task-list time — likely
   a `spawn_reservations` join in `queue.py`'s `list()` — which is exactly
   the Phase 1 (backend field) + Phase 3/4 (board plumbing + badge) span
   the original note anticipated; scope and implement as its own follow-up
   rather than folded into this session's item 1-2 fix.

### Phase 5 — Artifacts (claims) surface — was BLOCKED on the agent-worktrees accelerator, now UNBLOCKED
**Status update 2026-09-21:** the `agent-worktrees` accelerator prerequisite
this phase (and Phase 8) depended on is now built, hardened through 4 PRs
(#3102, #3147, #3186, #3206), and deployed — including the daemon-liveness
audit's boot-and-wait redesign that makes its own health signal trustworthy.
Phase 8's design entry (2026-09-21, see its own Journal writeup) resolves
the "agent-dispatch-side consumer" this phase also needs: Phase 5's
`artifacts_summary` is a second reader of that same relay file (see Phase
8's own numbered design above, step 5) — no separate poll mechanism to
design here.
- [x] Land `artifacts_summary` computation in `board_cli.py` (or wherever
      agent-dispatch tracks claims) and the drill-in claims viewer content
      for the Worktree Status card. (Not duplicated with Phase 3 — Phase 3
      only lands the column plumbing/manifest; the actual claims-tracking
      computation is owned here.) **Reconciled 2026-09-20 (see the
      `agent-worktrees` vision's new *external-status-consumer-contract*):**
      the worktree's own claims graph (PRs/issues/environments/sessions it
      owns or adopts) is `agent-worktrees`' durable ledger, per that
      vision's *Claims, leases, and obligations* concept — a duplicate,
      independently-computed claims model here would conflict with
      *derive-dont-duplicate*. This phase's `artifacts_summary` must
      **consume** that ledger (via the same coalesced projection read path
      Phase 8 uses), not recompute claims from scratch; if a genuinely
      distinct, agent-dispatch-owned notion of "claims" is ever needed
      (e.g. task-level, not worktree-level), name and scope that as an
      explicitly different concept before implementing it, rather than
      reusing the word for two different ownership boundaries.
- [x] Implement against the same relay file Phase 8 populates (see Phase
      8's numbered design) — do not stand up a second poller.

### Phase 6 — Source-repo grouping/filtering
- [ ] The REPO column ships in Phase 3. A dedicated repo filter chip
      (parallel to the Worktrees machine filter) is real, more invasive
      `engine.py` work — scope and design it as its own phase once the
      table itself is validated.

### Phase 7 — Task menu: wire lifecycle controls to Phase 2's APIs — COMPLETE (2026-09-29)
Everything here is UI wiring against the ALREADY-BUILT Phase 1/2 contracts —
no lifecycle-control logic invented at this layer.
- [x] Land the `charter` `kind:"card"` action. **Landed 2026-09-29**: a new
      `board_cli._charter_for_task()` composes a real `charter.*` payload
      (title/status/link/body) from fields already on every `Task` --
      structured metadata (repo, source, registrar/origin, target machine,
      labels) plus the durable goal/done-criteria when recorded, plus the
      raw prompt verbatim (fenced code block) so the operator can see both
      "what this task is" AND its raw content, mirroring how a steering
      card already shows raw prose. `has_charter` is now `True` for every
      task (every `Task` carries at least a title + prompt); no more
      `board_cli._build`-level gate to remove later.
- [x] Land the `worktree-status` `kind:"card"` action (read-only). This
      ended up landing with the Phase 5/8 relay work once
      `worktree_status.body` was populated from the real accelerator-backed
      projection rather than the preview fixture.
- [x] Wire "Open into a CLI session" to Phase 2's `embody --interactive`.
      `cli_openable` (Phase 1) gates visibility; the action itself performs
      no logic beyond invoking the coordinator transaction and launching the
      returned session. For Proposed/Queued (no existing worktree) the
      transaction creates one; for Suspended it resumes the existing one.
      **Landed 2026-09-22** via the dedicated picker-side `embody-cli`
      internal verb plus a real `cli_openable` predicate in `board_cli.py`.
- [x] Wire Pause/Unpause, Force-stop, and Reset-to-Proposed to Phase 2's
      corresponding verbs. This was already landed earlier (PRs #2913/#3008);
      the stale checklist here was overcounting it as still undone.
- [x] Render the user-pause hold as its own distinct, visible, filterable
      phase/badge — never conflated with system-Suspended or
      Blocked/awaiting-steer (Phase 1's hold design). **Landed 2026-09-29**:
      `board_cli._group()`/`task_query_cli._board_group()` (kept in sync,
      per their existing "byte-identical" contract) now check `hold_reason`
      right after the terminal-status checks and before `awaiting_steer` --
      so a held task always groups as `"Paused"`, taking priority over both
      system-`Suspended` and `Blocked`, but never over a terminal status (a
      hold can't be set on a concluded task; `set_hold` already rejects
      that). New `"Paused"` entry in `GROUPS`/`_BOARD_GROUPS` (right after
      `Blocked` — both need the operator's attention, but a paused task is
      waiting to be *unpaused*, not answered) and in `worktree-manager`'s
      shared `task_phase` palette (`engine_helpers.py`), coloured with
      `C_STATE["ORPHAN"]` (magenta) — deliberately distinct from
      `Suspended`'s teal and `Blocked`'s amber. The manifest's `abandon`
      action's `when.group` list gained `"Paused"` (force-abandon must still
      work on a paused task — "the user's way to say No" shouldn't be
      blocked by a hold); `reset-proposed`'s list needed NO change, since
      `reset()` already `reject_if_held`s and simply no longer matching
      `Paused` correctly hides the action instead of offering a call that
      would fail.
- [x] Force-abandon (already declared in the preview manifest) needs no new
      backend work beyond the Phase 1 concurrency-fencing requirement. This was
      already landed before 2026-09-22; only the checklist lagged behind.

**Phase 7 is now fully COMPLETE — both remaining gaps closed, nothing left
open in this phase.**

### Phase 8 — Worktree Status card (implementation)
- [x] Populate `worktree_status.body` from real session-lineage/claims/
      commit data instead of the preview's fixed fixture. **Operator
      feedback 2026-09-20:** confirmed against the live coordinator, every
      Worktree Status card currently comes up empty beyond its title — this
      phase is the fix, not a nice-to-have. Must render full details for an
      embodied task's worktree specifically (session lineage, expanded
      descriptor, claims), the vision's own stated purpose for this card —
      verify against a real embodied task before calling this phase done,
      not just the preview fixture.
- [ ] **Design constraint discovered 2026-09-20 (blocks a naive
      implementation) — see the Journal entry of the same date for the
      full investigation.** A `kind:"card"` action is documented as
      read-only against data already present on the entry ("No subprocess
      is run" at click time), and the Tasks-board's own render path
      (`__main__.py`'s `inbox --board`, which `board_cli.py` dispatches to
      on the local machine) is documented as "Pure coordinator-state
      rendering: no agent-worktrees/agent-bridge subprocesses on the Picker
      read path" (it re-runs on every Picker refresh). Neither can probe
      git/agent-worktrees per row or per click (`board_cli.py`'s own
      `subprocess.run` is an unrelated cross-machine forwarding path, not a
      git/agent-worktrees probe), and agent-dispatch's own coordinator
      tracks only task-scoped
      liveness (`last_liveness`, `activity`/`activity_updated_at`) — it has
      no worktree/session/git-state/claims authority of its own. Note also:
      agent-dispatch is a **separate plugin in its own venv**
      (`pivots.py`'s own contract: "data flows only through the
      contributing plugin's CLI on `PATH`, never a cross-venv import") — it
      cannot fall back to importing and directly recomputing
      `agent-worktrees`' facts itself the way a same-process
      `agent-worktrees` caller can. **Resolved direction (operator decision
      2026-09-20):** `agent-worktrees`'s resident accelerator becomes the
      coalesced, cached-projection read path for this data (worktree/session
      mapping, lineage + lifecycle event history, liveness, git state, the
      claims graph — see the `agent-worktrees` vision's new
      *external-status-consumer-contract* Feature and
      *force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit*/*a-full-health-check-leaves-
      nothing-stale* Behaviors, added the same date). Phase 8's own
      implementation therefore needs an **agent-dispatch-side consumer**
      of that cache — read on a cadence/trigger that keeps board rows
      populated without a per-render subprocess, reporting a fact it
      cannot confirm as stale/unknown rather than blocking the render or
      the click. **Ownership constraint (Copilot review, 2026-09-20):** the
      earlier idea of writing the accelerator's projection into an
      agent-dispatch task row as a background-supervisor poll was flagged
      as a real second, independently-aging copy of worktree state —
      conflicting with `provider-owned-worktrees-surface` (a control plane
      renders without persisting a second copy) and `derive-dont-duplicate`
      (agent-worktrees owns this state). Any read-side design must stay a
      **non-authoritative, transient view**. **Design resolved 2026-09-21,
      revised 2026-09-21 (see the Journal entries of the same date for the
      full writeup, including a Copilot review round that caught real
      topology/keying/transport/trigger gaps in the first pass) — the
      "agent-dispatch-side relay" design:**

      1. **A new asyncio task inside EACH machine's own local coordinator
         service**, never a shared/hosted one (**correction, Copilot review
         2026-09-21**: agent-dispatch's hybrid topology can serve a task's
         board row from a shared coordinator, but a worktree only exists on
         the one machine that actually claimed/embodies it — `agent-
         worktrees worktree-status-bundle` only ever resolves tracking
         records local to whatever machine runs it, so a shared coordinator
         probing it would either fail or, worse, silently read a same-named
         local worktree instead). `coordinator.py`'s resident ASGI app
         (alongside its existing `_gc_loop`/`_orphan_reap_loop` tasks) is
         still the right *kind* of host (**further correction**: not
         `supervise daemon`, which is optional and owns no liveness
         reconciliation), but each machine's own local instance only ever
         polls for worktree ids whose owning machine is itself. A new
         `_worktree_status_relay_loop` task, wired the same way
         `sweeper`/`orphan_reaper` already are, scoped to worktree ids from
         tasks in `Status.OWNED` (`CLAIMED`/`STARTED`/`SUSPENDED` —
         `queue_records.py`) whose `owner`/`target_machine` is this
         coordinator's own machine — never the whole fleet, never another
         machine's rows. **Correction (Copilot review 2026-09-21, "Resolve
         canonical repo lanes before invoking agent-worktrees"):** a task's
         `repo` field is agent-dispatch's own canonical remote lane (e.g.
         `github.com/org/repo`), not the value `agent-worktrees --project`
         accepts (a locally adopted project *name*) — passing the lane
         directly would fail project resolution and leave the relay cold
         for ordinary tasks. Resolve the lane through the existing
         `identity.name_for_repo(canonical)` mapping (with its documented
         `None` fallback for an unadopted repo, which simply skips that
         poll) before invoking the CLI, while still keying the relay by the
         canonical `repo` (stable across machines) rather than the locally-
         resolved name (which can vary per machine's own adoption). For
         each resolved worktree, it calls out to `agent-worktrees
         worktree-status-bundle --project <resolved-name> --worktree <id>`
         (the same real-caller path the accelerator's own audit now
         hardens) from this async task (a subprocess call off the request-
         handling path, e.g. via `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` or a
         thread executor), never the render/click path — so it is not the
         subprocess-free consumer the pattern doc's named exception
         describes; it is simply one more ordinary, coalesced caller of the
         accelerator, exactly as *external-status-consumer-contract*
         describes. A cross-machine board render (task claimed on machine
         B, rendered via machine A's shared/local coordinator) reads
         machine B's relay over the same
         federation/routing transport the board already uses to reach a
         remote coordinator for task data (step 3) — no new cross-machine
         mechanism to invent.
      2. **A local relay cache, keyed by `(repo, worktree_id)` — not
         worktree_id alone**, not a task-row column. (**Correction, Copilot
         review 2026-09-21**: the accelerator's own contract keys its
         request/cache on `(project, worktree_id)`. The relay's key uses
         agent-dispatch's canonical `repo` field — not the locally-resolved
         project name step 1 passes to `--project` (per the round-4
         correction above, those are different values; `repo` is stable
         across machines, the resolved name is not) — so a worktree-id
         suffix reused across two different adopted repos still cannot
         silently overwrite one project's projection with another's.) The
         coordinator writes each fetched projection (git
         state, session lineage, liveness, the claims graph — never message
         history, which stays excluded per *Not a transcript or event
         warehouse*) plus a `fetched_at` timestamp and the accelerator's own
         forwarded per-fact freshness/unconfirmed markers to a small local
         store (e.g. `worktree-status-relay.json`/sqlite, mirroring the
         accelerator's own cache-file pattern for concurrent-read safety),
         keyed by `(repo, worktree_id)` — **this is explicitly not the
         rejected idea from the Copilot review above.** That review flagged
         writing the projection into an agent-dispatch **task row** — the
         task's own durable, schema'd record — as a second, independently-
         aging copy of worktree state. This relay is not part of any task's
         record at all: it is a purely rebuildable cache the coordinator
         may drop or fall behind on at will, with nothing about a task's
         lifecycle or completion depending on its presence or freshness —
         the same "warmth, not truth" posture the accelerator's own cache
         already has one layer in.
      3. **The render path reads only through the coordinator's existing
         client API — never a subprocess, never a local file directly.**
         (**Correction, Copilot review 2026-09-21**: `board_cli` already
         supports `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` pointing at a remote coordinator and
         runs on the client host, so a raw local-file read would silently
         report every remote worktree as stale/missing even when the
         coordinator's own relay is warm.) The coordinator exposes the
         relay projection through a new endpoint on its existing HTTP API
         (the same transport `board_cli`'s client already uses for
         `c.mine()`/`c.get()`/etc.), keyed by `(repo, worktree_id)`;
         `board_cli`'s render function calls that endpoint (a fast local or
         networked API read, never a subprocess against agent-worktrees
         itself) for each worktree id it needs. An entry fresher than a
         render-side staleness ceiling (e.g. 2x the poll cadence) renders
         with its forwarded freshness markers; a missing or stale entry
         renders every fact as stale/unknown and moves on — never blocks
         the render or a card click, matching the pattern doc's own
         `subprocess-free-consumer-reports-stale-on-timeout` scenario shape
         exactly.
      4. **Cold-start prewarm, corrected to a real state-machine event.**
         (**Correction, Copilot review 2026-09-21**: the original "terminal
         back to tracked/live" trigger cannot fire — `Status.TERMINAL`
         (`COMPLETED`/`ABANDONED`/`DEAD_LETTER`) has no further transitions,
         per `queue_records.py`.) The real trigger is a task **entering**
         `Status.OWNED` (the `CLAIMED` transition, when `owner`/
         `target_worktree` is first established, or a `SUSPENDED` task
         resuming) — that is the actual moment a worktree becomes something
         worth polling. Schedule that worktree's first poll immediately at
         that transition (plus once for every already-`OWNED` task on
         coordinator startup) rather than waiting for the next periodic
         tick — the same pattern already proven in this exact effort for
         the `_setup_live_pivots`/`_prewarm_machine_key_map` cold-start fix
         (see the Phase 4 Journal entries above).
      5. **Phase 5 reuse:** the claims graph lives in the same per-
         `(repo, worktree_id)` projection this relay already caches, so
         Phase 5's `artifacts_summary` is just another reader of the
         identical relay (via the same coordinator API endpoint) — no
         second poll mechanism, no second cache.
      6. **Validation:** a render-path test asserting the board render
         function never shells out (mirroring existing "Picker read path:
         no subprocess" assertions elsewhere in this codebase), a relay
         freshness/staleness test covering the pattern doc's
         `subprocess-free-consumer-reports-stale-on-timeout` scenario, and
         a cross-machine test asserting a shared/remote coordinator never
         polls a worktree it does not own.

      Recent-message history is explicitly NOT part of this cache (pulled
      on demand from the owning session host instead, per the vision's
      existing *Not a transcript or event warehouse* non-goal) — Phase 8's
      card body should treat any "last messages" content, if wanted at all,
      as a separate on-demand fetch, not a cached field. **Claims
      specifically are Phase 5's own field** (see that phase's 2026-09-20
      note) — Phase 8 renders whatever Phase 5 exposes rather than
      computing claims itself.
- [x] Implement the relay poller in the coordinator service (step 1-2 above),
      the render-path reader in `board_cli`/`__main__.py`'s `inbox --board`
      (step 3), the cold-start prewarm hook (step 4), and the three
      regression tests (step 6 — render-path no-subprocess, freshness/
      staleness, and cross-machine ownership). Wire Phase 5's
      `artifacts_summary` to the same relay file once this lands (step 5).

### Phase 9 — Configuration → Registrars viewer/editor (implementation)
- [ ] Build the Configuration-menu view listing every registration
      (`ProfileDeclaration` fields) and wire enable/disable to
      `overrides.py`'s existing store. No add/delete affordance. Note: the
      existing `ConfigSection` contract only *runs an external command*; a
      real inline read/write viewer is new `engine.py` surface, not a
      manifest-only addition — scope that explicitly when this phase starts.

### Phase 10 — New Task composer (implementation)
Realizes the [tasks-pane-ux vision](README.md)'s *The New Task composer*
concept, added 2026-09-25 alongside the parent vision's monitor/confirmed
primitives (PR #3622/#3625). No backend dependency on this effort's Phase 1
sibling `agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state` — composing and queuing
a task is exactly today's `propose` + `queue` (already implemented), just
never surfaced as a picker action.

**Depends on** the sibling effort
[`picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer`](../picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer/README.md)'s
**Phase B** (2026-09-30) — investigation that session did (see that effort's
own README) found the Plan bullet below's own assumption wrong: the
registered-pivot `PivotAction`/`kind:"form"` mechanism is **row-scoped by
design** (every field spec resolves against an already-selected entry), and
Worktrees' own "+ New worktree…" button — the thing this Plan says to
"mirror" — turns out to be hand-coded UI chrome, not a generic mechanism any
registered pivot can opt into via its manifest. Do not start this phase
until that sibling effort's Phase B lands a real pivot-level "create" action
concept; this phase then just declares agent-dispatch's own field list
against it.
- [ ] A **New task…** pivot action on the Tasks pivot (`PivotAction`,
      mirroring the Worktrees pane's **New worktree…**), opening the SAME
      declarative composer machinery already proven for steering
      (`kind:"form"` / `PivotFormScreen`) — no new modal widget.
- [ ] Composer fields: title, free-form prompt/goal-payload textbox (reuse
      the steering card's input widget), and a **tags & criteria picker**
      built from the exact vocabulary a pool's filter already matches
      against — repo lane (default: current), `requires`/`rejects`
      capabilities, `role`, `task-type`. Source the picker's option list
      from whatever already introspects a pool's filter vocabulary
      (`registrar.py`/`overrides.py` — confirm the exact accessor when this
      phase starts; not yet located in this session).
- [ ] Submitting the composer is `propose` + `queue` against the
      coordinator in one motion (client.py's existing calls), returning
      immediately so the operator can open the composer again right away
      for the next hand-authored task in a batch.
- [ ] Tests: composer round-trips title/prompt/tags into the exact
      `propose`/`queue` call shape; tags map onto the same pool-filter
      predicate a registrar's own filter declaration would use (no
      derivation gap vs. an emitter-authored task).

### Phase 11 — Completion Review card (implementation)
Realizes the [tasks-pane-ux vision](README.md)'s *The Completion Review
card* concept. **Depends on**
`agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state`'s Phase 2 (`confirm`/
`reopen_completed` on `TaskQueue`, plus `board_cli.py`'s `confirmed` group
projection) — do not start this phase until that sibling effort's Phase 2
has landed.
- [ ] A **completed-but-unconfirmed** task's card, reached the same way the
      steering card is — reusing `kind:"card"` (`PivotCardScreen`) — showing
      the worker's result reference, accumulated progress log, and
      prominent artifacts (reusing the Phase 5 shared artifacts surface).
- [ ] Four actions, never a silent fifth: **Confirm** (calls
      `TaskQueue.confirm`), **Re-queue with steering** (reuses the
      steering-card input verbatim, calls `TaskQueue.reopen_completed` with
      the given steer fields), **Abandon** (existing force-abandon verb),
      **Save for later** (no-op — the card simply closes; per
      *self-tracked-review-is-not-a-lane* this costs no pool slot and needs
      no special "parked" bookkeeping beyond the task staying `completed`).
- [ ] `task_phase` palette: add `confirmed` (green/terminal family, same
      bucket as the existing `Completed`/`Abandoned` dark-grey-terminal
      treatment) and ensure a `completed`-and-unconfirmed row is visually
      distinguishable from a `confirmed` one (e.g. an inline "review
      pending" marker) so the backlog of unreviewed completions is legible
      at a glance, not just reachable by drilling in.
- [ ] Tests: the card's four actions call the exact sibling-effort API
      shapes; a `confirmed` task never offers this card (nothing to
      review); an emitter-driven task whose evaluator already auto-confirmed
      likewise never surfaces it.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Unit tests for the Phase 1 liveness-auto-transition-to-Suspended
      reconciliation path (a CLI-embodied session's death is detected and
      transitions the task, exactly like the existing headless-session
      case).
- [ ] Unit tests for the Phase 1 interactive-embodiment transaction's
      concurrency fencing: a pool claim and an interactive-embodiment
      transaction racing the same task must never both succeed.
- [ ] Unit tests for the Phase 1 user-pause hold: claim/resume/wake-delivery/
      recovery/release/supervisor-spawn all reject a held task; force-stop
      does not itself set or require a hold.
- [ ] Unit tests for the `task_phase` palette and the manifest's declarative
      columns (mirroring `tests/production_picker/test_pivots.py` patterns).
- [ ] Unit tests for `board_cli.py`'s new `artifacts_summary`/`wt_live`
      fields.
- [ ] Unit tests for `pause`/`unpause`/`force-stop`/`reset` CLI verbs against
      `task_state_machine.py`'s transition table AND the Phase 1 concurrency
      fencing (a stale caller must be rejected, not silently succeed).
- [ ] Unit tests for the Configuration → Registrars view against
      `overrides.py` (`set_override`/`clear_override` round-trip).
- [ ] Unit tests for the Phase 10 New Task composer: submitted tags map onto
      the same pool-filter predicate vocabulary a registrar declares.
- [ ] Unit tests for the Phase 11 Completion Review card's four actions
      against `agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state`'s
      `confirm`/`reopen_completed` API shapes.
- [ ] A picker-TUI snapshot/golden test (per `tests/production_picker/
      goldens/`) covering the shipped Tasks pane layout.
- [ ] Manual pass against a live coordinator: steer a real blocked task,
      force-abandon a task, pause and unpause an embodied task (confirm
      agent-dispatch does not re-queue it while paused), open a Proposed
      task into a CLI session and confirm it never resolves a pool or
      worker identity, then kill that CLI session and confirm the task
      auto-transitions to Suspended rather than lingering as Started. Queue
      a small hand-authored batch through the New Task composer, then walk
      each to `confirmed`, `reopen`, and `abandon` through the Completion
      Review card.

## Proposal

_Pending operator review of the Phase 0 previews._

## Journal

### 2026-09-17 — Kickoff + Phase 0 previews
- Effort + vision moved upstream from a private knowledge-repo draft into
  `copilot-extensions` per the operator's request that the buildout live
  here.
- Grounded the design against `TasksView`/`WorktreesView` in `engine.py`,
  `task_state_machine.py`'s `Status` enum, `board_cli.py`'s `GROUPS`/
  `_group()`, `registrar.py`'s `ProfileDeclaration`, and `overrides.py`'s
  existing enable/disable store.
- Added a `task_phase` palette to `engine.py` (additive; `C_STATE`/
  `_STATE_PALETTE` untouched).
- Built `worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/tasks-preview/` — a
  hermetic demo fleet + a proposed pivot manifest + a driver script — and
  captured six real screenshots of the redesigned Tasks pane, the task
  action menu, the charter viewer, the Worktree Status card, and the steer
  modal, all rendered through the actual Textual `PickerApp` (no mockup
  rendering engine). Discovered along the way: a pivot manifest filename
  matching a real installed plugin (`agent-dispatch.json`) is
  identity-checked against that plugin's own template and dropped if it
  diverges (`pivots.py`'s `_KNOWN_LEGACY_PIVOTS`) — the preview manifest
  uses a distinct filename (`agent-dispatch-preview.json`) to avoid that;
  and a `kind:"card"` action's `status_from`/`link_from` default to
  `card.status`/`card.link` when unset, so a card rooted at a different
  dotted path should declare them explicitly (fixed in the preview
  manifest) to avoid leaking an unrelated card's status/link.

### 2026-09-17 — Feedback round 1: "Open into a CLI session" gating
- Operator caught that the preview offered "Open into a CLI session" for an
  embodied task with a LIVE headless agent (Blocked/Started) — impossible in
  practice, since CLI and ACP cannot co-drive one session. Corrected the gate
  to a board-computed `cli_openable` field: true only for Proposed, a Queued
  task with no `pool` assigned, or Suspended; false for Blocked/Started
  (live embodied) and for any terminal phase. Re-captured the task menu for
  all five reachable phases (Blocked, Started, Suspended, Queued+pooled,
  Proposed) to show the corrected matrix.
- Also specified the intended `--interactive` launch behavior for this
  action: a succinct prompt seeds the agent with the task's charter and
  current phase, framed so the agent keeps driving the task toward its next
  phase while the **operator** decides when to wrap up — and when they do,
  the agent's job is to leave the task's recorded state honest
  (complete/abandon/reset-to-proposed/re-queue), not to keep working
  unattended after the session ends. Captured as a Phase 5 implementation
  requirement (`board_cli.py`'s `cli_openable` + the actual prompt
  composition); the preview's `open-cli` action description now states this
  intent directly.

### 2026-09-17 — Feedback round 2: line-wrap + scroll-reset (real engine fixes)
- Operator flagged that titles/cells line-wrapped in the Tasks table
  screenshot, and separately (broader complaint) that redrawing the table
  jumps scroll back to the top — particularly disruptive for Tasks, whose
  background poll can rebuild the list while the operator is reading a task
  near the bottom. Root-caused and fixed both as **real, generalizable
  `engine.py`/`pivots.py`/`plugin_contracts.py` changes** (not preview-only
  scaffolding), verified against the full existing worktree-manager test
  suite (883 passed, 1 skipped, no regressions):
  1. **Line-wrap:** `Column` gained an optional `priority` field (defaults to
     declaration order); `TasksView._fitted_columns()` runs a pivot's
     declared columns through the SAME `fit()` drop/shrink algorithm the
     Worktrees list already uses before rendering the header/rows, so a
     manifest whose columns sum wider than the render viewport now
     shrinks/drops columns (lowest-priority — e.g. ARTIFACTS — first)
     instead of silently wrapping. Verified at both a narrow 118-col capture
     (ARTIFACTS gracefully dropped) and a realistic 160-col capture (every
     column shown) — `tasks-list.png` / `tasks-list-wide.png`.
  2. **Scroll reset:** `_PickerNativeData._rebuild()` (the native
     `OptionList` wrapper backing both Worktrees and Tasks) now captures the
     widget's scroll offset before `clear_options()` wipes it and restores
     it after the rebuild completes, instead of leaving every full rebuild
     parked at the top. `_try_selection_repaint`'s existing O(delta)
     in-place repaint (Worktrees-only, cursor-move-only) still bypasses this
     entirely for that one case; this fix covers every OTHER rebuild path
     (pivot switch, data change, and — the one that motivated this fix —
     the Tasks pivot's background `list` poll tick).
- Both fixes are cross-cutting engine improvements (benefit any registered
  pivot's declarative-columns table and any full list rebuild), landed here
  because this effort's preview work is what surfaced them, not because
  they're Tasks-specific in implementation.

### 2026-09-17 — Feedback round 3: never route CLI-open through the pool/identity
- Operator specified an important constraint: opening a task into a CLI
  session must **never** use the pool or a dedicated worker identity
  (`worker_identities.py`'s named acting-theme/focus/rules bundle) for that
  task. Rationale — a pool/identity assignment applies rails to keep an
  *unattended* headless agent on target; a CLI session is the opposite
  case, operator-driven and deliberately open-ended, so those rails are
  actively unwanted there. Updated the preview's `open-cli` action
  description, `fake_board.py`'s module docstring, and Phase 5's Plan item
  to state this as a hard implementation constraint: the CLI-open path
  spins up a bare interactive session seeded only with the succinct context
  prompt (charter + phase + task-state tooling) — never "assign the pool's
  dedicated worker, then attach a terminal to it" — for every
  `cli_openable` phase, including a currently-unpooled Queued task (the CLI
  path never acquires a pool on its way in).

### 2026-09-17 — Rubber-duck design review: 3 blockers, resolved before Phase 1
Before starting any implementation PR, ran a full design review (via a
`rubber-duck` sub-agent, given the effort/vision docs, the proposed manifest,
the demo fixture, the real `engine.py`/`pivots.py`/`plugin_contracts.py` diff,
and read access to the actual `agent_dispatch` package) specifically to
stress-test the lifecycle-control design before committing to backend work.
**Verdict: no-go on the previously-numbered Phase 1 as sequenced** — the
display/table work is sound and already tested, but three lifecycle
affordances were specified as UI affordances ahead of the backend ownership/
state contracts they need to be safe. Full findings and the operator's
resolutions:

1. **[blocker] `cli_openable` was derived from the presentation `group`
   (Blocked/Proposed/etc.), not authoritative liveness.** The review noted
   the fixture's own "Blocked" task carries `status: suspended` with a live
   agent, and asked whether a Started task with a since-terminated CLI
   session should also be eligible.
   **Resolution (operator):** Agreed this is a sub-state analysis, and in
   principle a Started task IS eligible once its live session (CLI or
   headless) has actually died. Rather than special-casing that in
   `cli_openable`'s own logic, the coordinator must **never let that state
   persist**: extend the existing dead-lease reconciliation to also detect a
   dead CLI session and auto-transition the task to Suspended. Once that
   invariant holds, `board_cli.py` computing `cli_openable` from the
   projected group is a correct, cheap approximation of the real liveness
   check — not a shortcut around it. Captured as new Phase 1's first two
   items (the auto-transition invariant + the approximation it licenses).
2. **[blocker] The proposed CLI-open flow isn't implementable as a picker
   navigation verb, and bypassing the pool currently means bypassing the
   whole ownership/claim protocol too** (race with a pool claim, duplicate
   worktrees, orphaned lineage).
   **Resolution (operator):** Agreed. Confirmed the exact flow: (1) create a
   new worktree if none is assigned yet, else use the existing one; (2) bind
   the worktree to the task and auto-claim the task to it (the SAME
   ownership/generation fencing a pool claim uses, so a concurrent pool claim
   can never race it); (3) pass an `--interactive` prompt that informs the
   CLI agent of the task binding up front — the agent should set to work,
   but, being genuinely non-railroaded, may pause and ask the operator
   directly for instructions at any point (expected, not an escape hatch).
   Confirmed this needs a real "interactive embodiment transaction" in the
   coordinator, exactly as the review proposed. Captured as new Phase 1's
   third item, with Phase 2 building the CLI verb and Phase 7 only wiring
   the Picker action to it.
3. **[blocker] Pause can't reuse `overrides.py`** (registrar/pool-wide, not
   per-task) **or plain `Suspended`** (already a system-recoverable hold,
   and the fixture's own `paused_by_user` flag alongside `group: Suspended`
   is exactly the "Suspended means two different things" trap the review
   called out).
   **Resolution (operator):** Agreed — pause needs to be genuine system
   state. The UX provides the *control* surface for it, but every part of
   the flow (claim, resume, wake-delivery, liveness recovery, release,
   supervisor spawning) must check the hold and honor it, not just the
   Picker's own display. Captured as new Phase 1's fourth item (a durable
   per-task hold record, distinct from system-Suspended and from
   Blocked/awaiting-steer) and Phase 2's `pause`/`unpause` verbs.

The remaining "significant" findings (phase-sequencing contradictions,
stale-menu concurrency, the vision's unowned reverse task↔worktree
projection, silent column-dropping, and the `kind:"card"` default-inheritance
footgun) are folded directly into the re-sequenced Plan above (new Phases
1–9) rather than repeated here — see each phase's own bullets for where they
landed. No code changed as a result of this review; it is pure design/plan
revision. The already-landed generic engine work (palette, column-fit,
scroll-preserve) is unaffected and ships with Phase 3 as planned.

### 2026-09-17 — Phase 1 implementation begins: the pause hold lands
Operator: "let's dive in" — began real implementation against the
re-sequenced Plan, in this same worktree (all Phase 0/1 context/tooling
lives on this branch; splitting into a per-phase worktree happens once a
phase is ready to submit for review, per the Coordination section).

- Surveyed `agent_dispatch`'s `queue.py`/`queue_liveness.py`/`lease.py`/
  `task_state_machine.py`/`tracking.py`/`embody.py`/`overrides.py` in
  detail (a background `explore` sub-agent report) to ground Phase 1's
  design against the REAL transition/fencing/liveness machinery rather than
  guessing. Key findings folded into the Runbook above: `CoordinatorLease`
  is unrelated (coordinator election, not task/session liveness);
  `LivenessMixin.reconcile_liveness` already detects a dead owner session
  and requeues/dead-letters it, but has no `-> suspended` branch; the
  package already distinguishes CLI-backed ("live-sessions" registry) from
  headless ("sessions" registry) embodiment in `tracking.py`; `overrides.py`
  confirmed unsuitable for a per-task hold (machine-local, registrar-scoped,
  outside the SQLite task transaction).
- **Landed Phase 1, item 1 (the pause hold) for real** in
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/queue.py`: additive
  `hold_reason`/`hold_actor`/`hold_at` columns (via `_COLUMNS` + the `Task`
  dataclass — `_TASK_DB_COLUMNS`/`_TASK_SELECT` derive from
  `dataclasses.fields(Task)`, so no separate column-list sync was needed),
  `TaskQueue.set_hold`/`clear_hold` (transactional, idempotent, audited,
  refuses on a terminal task), a new `_transition(...,
  reject_if_held=True)` parameter wired into `resume` and
  `release_suspended`, and a `hold_reason IS NULL` gate added to
  `claim_one`'s eligibility query. 5 new tests added to `tests/test_queue.py`
  (`test_set_hold_blocks_resume_release_and_reclaim`,
  `test_set_hold_on_queued_task_prevents_claim`,
  `test_set_hold_requires_a_reason`, `test_set_hold_refuses_terminal_task`,
  `test_set_hold_is_idempotent_and_clear_hold_is_a_noop_when_unheld`).
- **Validated:** built the `agent-dispatch` package's own `.venv` (it hadn't
  been built in this worktree before) and ran its full test suite:
  **2834 passed, 2 failed, 8 skipped** in ~15 minutes. The 2 failures
  (`test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py::test_sh_skips_spawn_without_
  opt_in` / `test_sh_proceeds_with_opt_in`) are a **pre-existing, unrelated**
  Windows/bash path-mangling issue in a bootstrap-check script test (a
  Windows path gets its backslashes eaten when handed to `bash.EXE`) —
  confirmed unrelated to this change (different file, different subsystem,
  fails identically regardless of the queue.py edits). This is the
  established baseline for this worktree on this machine going forward.
- **Not done yet:** Phase 1 items 2–4 (auto-suspend-on-dead-liveness, the
  interactive embodiment transaction, and universal mutating-action
  fencing) — see the Runbook above for exact next steps, entry points, and
  design notes so the next session (or this one, resumed) does not have to
  redo this survey.
- Added the **Runbook** section (above, right after Coordination) as the
  durable "how to pick this up" artifact for the manual sequenced-session
  handoff loop the operator asked for: any fresh session reads it first,
  finds the exact current position, and continues without re-deriving
  context from the Journal alone. It will be updated at every handoff
  point going forward.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 1, item 2: auto-suspend on dead liveness lands
Resumed from the prior session's handoff (`handoff-0f4b6106-...`), same
worktree, per the Runbook.

- Surveyed `queue_liveness.py`'s `reconcile_liveness`, `tracking.py`'s
  `liveness_verdict`/`resolve_live_session` (worktree-keyed, the bridge's
  interactive `live_sessions` registry only), `supervisor.py`'s
  `_has_headless_reservation` query pattern, and `spawn_factories.py`'s
  `_parse_local_body_handle`/`_parse_fleet_body_handle`/
  `_default_local_body_verdict`/`_default_fleet_verdict` (already the
  established convention supervisor.py itself uses for direct
  by-session-id liveness probes). Confirmed `make_embody_spawn`
  (`agent-worktrees ... embody`, an interactive/CLI-driven worker) is the
  CURRENT production spawn path whose reservations carry a **bare**
  session id (no `local-body:`/`fleet-body:` prefix) — i.e. exactly the
  "CLI-embodied" case the resolver-keyed `tracking.liveness_verdict` path
  is for, while `make_headless_spawn`/`FleetSpawner` always prefix their
  handle.
- **Landed Phase 1, item 2** in `queue_liveness.py`: `reconcile_liveness`
  now looks up each held task's active spawn reservation
  (`_active_headless_handle`, mirroring `queue.py`'s
  `_has_headless_reservation`) to classify it before probing. A
  `local-body:`/`fleet-body:`-tagged reservation is headless — probed
  directly by session id via new `headless_local_verdict`/
  `headless_fleet_verdict` params (defaulting to
  `spawn_factories._default_local_body_verdict`/`_default_fleet_verdict`)
  — and its confirmed-`gone` outcome is UNCHANGED (requeue, or
  dead-letter past `max_attempts`). No matching reservation is CLI-embodied
  (or not yet identifiable) — still probed via the pre-existing
  worktree-keyed `resolver`/`tracking.liveness_verdict` — and its
  confirmed-`gone` **`started`** task now auto-suspends instead (a
  `claimed`-not-`started` CLI task keeps the old behavior, since `suspend`
  has no legal `claimed` origin in `task_state_machine.py`). The suspend
  write mirrors `TaskQueue.suspend()` (clears `lease_expires_at`/
  `last_liveness`, keeps owner/owner-session identity for a later `resume`
  to rebind) and keeps the exact pre-existing generation/owner-session CAS
  fencing. New `counts["suspended"]`.
- **Tests:** added `test_reconcile_gone_cli_embodied_task_is_suspended_not_
  requeued` and `test_reconcile_gone_headless_task_still_requeues` (plus a
  `_claim_and_start_headless` helper) to `test_gc.py`. Updated 4
  pre-existing tests whose fixtures/assertions encoded the OLD
  (pre-distinction) behavior for a scenario now correctly reclassified:
  `test_gc.py`'s identity/fencing/dead-letter-cap tests (renamed/adjusted
  to assert `suspended`, or switched to the new `_claim_and_start_headless`
  helper to keep exercising the unchanged requeue path) and
  `test_supervisor.py`'s `test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned`,
  `test_recover_gone_releases_stale_reservation_and_respawns`, and
  `test_recover_leaves_live_or_unknown` (their `_ok_spawn()` handle switched
  to a `local-body:`-prefixed one, since supervisor's own automatic
  respawn-on-gone logic is a headless-body behavior; also added the
  matching `local_body_verdict_fn` overrides so `Supervisor.recover_gone`'s
  own headless-specific probe routes through the test's verdict too).
- **Validated:** full suite re-run twice (once mid-change to catch the
  supervisor-test fallout, once final) — **2835 passed, 2 failed
  (the same pre-existing, unrelated `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in
  .py` Windows/bash path-mangling failures), 8 skipped**, ~13.5 minutes.
  No other regressions.
- **Not done yet:** Phase 1 items 3–4 (the interactive embodiment
  transaction; universal mutating-action fencing) — see the Runbook above.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 1, item 3: the interactive embodiment transaction lands
Continued the same session (operator chose "continue now into item 3" when
asked, given item 3's real design work).

- Surveyed `embody.py` (`spawn_embodied_worker`, `prepare_reusable_worktree`,
  `create_worktree`, `resolve_worktree`), `supervisor.py`'s
  `_prepare_spawn_task` (the exact resolve-or-create-worktree +
  record_spawn_worktree + spawn_fn sequence to mirror), `client.py`'s
  `claim`/`start`/`resume`/`reserve_spawn`/`record_spawn*` methods, and the
  coordinator's `/claim`/`/resume` routes. Key finding: `make_embody_spawn`
  (launch via `agent-worktrees embody`, a real interactive/attachable mux+
  Copilot session) is the ALREADY-EXISTING "CLI-embodied" spawn path
  `tracking.liveness_verdict` (item 2's CLI branch) is built for — its
  reservation handle carries a bare session id, never a `local-body:`/
  `fleet-body:` prefix, confirming item 2's classifier is exactly right.
- Worked out the bind-vs-launch ordering by first principles: `start()`
  optionally captures `owner_session_id` (only known once Copilot has
  actually launched), but `resume()` must adopt a session id in the SAME
  atomic transition. A **queued** task IS claimable by a competing pool
  worker, so `claim` (identity only, no session) has to happen BEFORE the
  launch to close that race; a **suspended** task has no such race (`claim`
  only ever picks from `queued`), so its single-step `resume(...,
  adopt_owner_session_id=...)` bind runs AFTER the launch instead, where it
  can adopt the just-launched session atomically. This became the module's
  documented design rationale.
- Discovered mid-implementation that `resume`'s CAS fencing checks
  `expected_generation` AND `owner_session_id == expected_owner_session_id`
  together (not generation alone) — an early version failed with "ownership
  incarnation changed" until `expected_owner_session_id` (captured from the
  read at the top of the transaction) was threaded through too.
- Discovered a second gap while designing the failure story: a **queued**
  task whose pre-launch `claim` succeeded but whose embody launch then
  failed would be stranded `claimed` forever with no session and no active
  reservation -- exactly the state item 2's own liveness GC cannot recover
  (an uncaptured `owner_session_id` never escalates to `gone`). Added
  `_release_prelaunch_claim` (`yield_task`, `release_spawn=False`, since
  `fail_spawn` already released the reservation) for this one case; the
  suspended/resume path never pre-claims, so it has nothing to release
  there — its one unresolved edge (launch succeeds, bind itself fails) is
  documented as intentionally not self-healed (see the module docstring).
- **Landed** `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/interactive_embody
  .py` (`launch_interactive_embodiment` + `InteractiveEmbodimentError`),
  a new `interactive_worker_prompt` in `embody_prompts.py` (deliberately
  lighter than `autopilot_worker_prompt`: no worker identity, no pool/
  recipe framing, explicitly non-railroaded, and tells the agent to leave
  the task's state honest -- complete/suspend/abandon -- whenever the
  session ends per the operator's Phase 0 feedback-round-1 framing), a new
  optional `seed` override param on `embody.spawn_embodied_worker` (every
  existing call site unaffected), and a small additive backend extension:
  `ResumeBody`/`DispatchClient.resume()` gained `adopt_owner_session_id`
  (explicit, caller-named target) alongside the existing `adopt_session`
  (which resolves the CALLER's OWN current session -- the wrong direction
  for a transaction resuming a task into a session it just launched but
  isn't itself running inside of); mutually exclusive, additive,
  backward-compatible.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_interactive_embody.py`, 11 new tests covering the
  fresh/proposed/suspended happy paths, ineligible-status rejection, the
  claim-race, launch-failure (and its claim-release), worktree-prep
  failure, and a resume generation-race -- all against a real `TaskQueue`
  with `embody`'s subprocess-shelling functions mocked (no real
  `agent-worktrees`/Copilot process). Extended `test_supervisor.py`'s
  `QueueBackedClient` test double locally (subclassed, not modified in
  place) with the `approve`/`claim`/`start` verbs it never needed before.
- **Validated:** full suite re-run — **2846 passed, 2 pre-existing
  unrelated failures (the same Windows/bash `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile
  _opt_in.py` mangling), 8 skipped**, ~14 minutes. No other regressions.
- **Not done yet:** Phase 1 item 4 (universal mutating-action fencing) --
  the last Phase 1 item; Phase 2 (the CLI verbs, including `agent-dispatch
  embody --interactive` wiring this transaction to a real CLI surface) is
  next after that. See the Runbook above.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 1, item 4: universal mutating-action fencing lands (Phase 1 COMPLETE)
Continued the same session (operator chose "continue now into item 4").

- Surveyed `_transition`'s existing `expected_generation`/
  `expected_owner_session_id` fencing and confirmed a real gap it does NOT
  close: `generation` only bumps on a handoff-style adopt (`resume(...,
  adopt_owner_session_id=...)`) -- ordinary transitions like `suspend`/
  `abandon`/`complete` never touch it, so it cannot by itself detect "the
  status changed since the operator's UI cached this row" (item 4's actual
  target scenario). Concluded `expected_status` is a distinct, needed
  fencing dimension alongside the existing identity fencing, not a
  duplicate of it.
- Added `_check_expected_status(task, expected_status)` (`queue.py`) --a
  small shared helper raising a uniform "task changed; refresh and retry" --
  and wired it into `_transition` itself (atomic with the rest of the
  write, so every `_transition`-backed verb gets it for free) plus three
  methods that don't go through `_transition`: `set_hold`/`clear_hold`
  (the pause/unpause primitives) and `submit_steer`. Exposed
  `expected_status`/`expected_generation`/`expected_owner_session_id` on
  `abandon()` (previously had none of the three). `clear_hold`'s
  already-unheld idempotent no-op is checked BEFORE the new fence
  (unpausing an already-unpaused task satisfies the operator's intent
  regardless of status drift -- mirrors item 1's own idempotency framing).
- Threaded the new fields end-to-end: `SteerBody`/`AbandonBody` (coordinator
  Pydantic models) gained the new fields, the `/tasks/{id}/steer` and
  `/tasks/{id}/abandon` routes pass them through, and
  `DispatchClient.steer()`/`.abandon()` expose them. `force-stop`/`reset`
  are Phase 2 CLI verbs with no existing queue primitive to fence yet --
  explicitly left for Phase 2 to wire against this now-established pattern
  rather than inventing something new; item 3's interactive-embodiment
  transaction already fences its own `resume`/`start` calls (unchanged).
- **Tests:** 7 new tests in `tests/test_queue.py` -- `set_hold`/`clear_hold`
  stale-status rejection (and the already-unheld idempotent-no-op
  exception), `abandon` stale-status rejection, `abandon`'s existing
  identity fencing reused verbatim, and `submit_steer` stale-status
  rejection.
- **Validated:** full suite run **twice**. First run: 2850 passed, 3 failed
  -- the 2 known pre-existing unrelated failures plus one single flake in
  `test_supervisor.py::test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned`. Re-ran
  that one test alone (passed) and the full `test_supervisor.py` file alone
  (224/224 passed) to rule out a real regression, then re-ran the FULL
  suite a second time end-to-end: **2851 passed, 2 pre-existing unrelated
  failed (the same Windows/bash mangling), 8 skipped**, no other failures --
  confirming the single earlier failure was an occasional flake (logged in
  the Runbook in case it recurs), not something this change introduced.
- **Phase 1 is now COMPLETE** (all 4 items landed, tested, committed).
  Phase 2 (the CLI verbs) is next -- see the Runbook above for the full
  pointer and the Plan section for the checklist.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 2: the four CLI verbs land (Phase 2 COMPLETE)
Continued the same session (operator chose "continue now into Phase 2").

- **`pause`/`unpause`**: thin CLI wrappers over `client.set_hold`/
  `clear_hold`. Needed new `DispatchClient.set_hold`/`.clear_hold` methods
  and `/tasks/{id}/hold`/`/unhold` coordinator routes (`HoldBody`/
  `UnholdBody`) -- Phase 1 built the backend primitive but never exposed it
  over HTTP.
- **`embody --interactive`**: resolves this machine (agent-worktrees, or
  `--machine`) and calls item 3's `launch_interactive_embodiment` directly
  -- client-side orchestration like `Supervisor`, not a coordinator route,
  since the actual `agent-worktrees`/Copilot subprocess launch has to run
  on the invoking machine. `--interactive` is required (the only mode
  implemented; distinguishes this verb from the supervisor's own
  unattended-autopilot spawn path, which already exists under a different
  name).
- **`force-stop`**: new module `force_stop.py`. Surveyed `bridge.py`'s
  `end_worker` (idle-gated `--if-idle`, wrong for a deliberate hard stop)
  and `embody.py`'s `stop_fleet_body` (already unconditional, reusable
  verbatim for a fleet-hosted session) -- added `bridge.force_end_session`
  (`agent-bridge end <id> --force`) as the missing local-unconditional
  counterpart. Local-vs-fleet is decided by comparing the task's
  `owner`'s machine to the caller's own. Only eligible from `started`
  (mirrors `suspend`'s own legal domain -- a merely-`claimed` task never
  had a live session to stop). Session termination is explicitly
  best-effort: the `suspend` state transition proceeds regardless of
  whether termination could be confirmed, since the operator's actual
  intent (stop treating this as running) doesn't depend on a clean
  teardown. This required threading `expected_status`/
  `expected_generation`/`expected_owner_session_id` through `suspend()`
  itself (had none before) plus its coordinator route/client method.
- **`reset --to proposed`**: the one verb needing genuinely new state-
  machine surface -- no existing transition went back to `proposed` from
  anywhere. Added a declared `reset` transition
  (`{queued,claimed,started,suspended} -> proposed`) to
  `task_state_machine.py` and `TaskQueue.reset()`. Design call: preserve
  the durable goal/done_criteria/progress_log (an operator wants a fresh
  attempt at the SAME task, not a new one) while discarding owner/session/
  lease/activity/card state; refuse on a held task (mirrors `resume`'s
  `reject_if_held` -- an explicit pause should never be silently
  overridden by a reset). Full expected-status/generation/owner-session
  fencing via `_transition`, reused verbatim -- no new fencing mechanism
  needed for any of the four verbs; Phase 1's machinery covered all of
  them once exposed.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_force_stop.py` (6 new: local/fleet/no-session/
  ineligible-status/termination-failure-still-suspends), 9 new
  `test_queue.py` tests for `reset`, 4 new `test_coordinator.py` tests
  (hold/unhold x2, reset x2), and 9 new CLI-layer tests in `test_cli.py`
  covering all four verbs' success and error paths.
- **Validated**: full suite run twice. First run: 2878 passed, 3 failed --
  the 2 known pre-existing failures plus one single flake in
  `test_managed_companion.py::test_real_managed_companion_readiness_
  rollback_and_stop` (a real-subprocess-startup-timeout test, inherently
  load-sensitive -- confirmed by re-running it alone: passed). Second full
  run: **2879 passed, 2 pre-existing unrelated failed, 8 skipped**, no
  other failures.
- **Phase 2 is now COMPLETE.** Phase 3 (task schema + column contract,
  display-only, already partially landed in Phase 0) is next and does not
  depend on Phase 2 -- see the Plan section.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 3: manifest + column fields land (one item deferred)
Continued the same session (operator chose "discuss" first for the
`wt_live`/`artifacts_summary` data-source design, then approved: reuse
existing `activity`/`activity_updated_at` for `wt_live`; land
`artifacts_summary` as an explicit placeholder pending Phase 5).

- Discovered `plugins/agent-dispatch/pivots/agent-dispatch.json` already
  EXISTED -- an older, simpler manifest predating this effort (no columns,
  fewer actions, three action descriptions not yet updated for the
  now-implemented backend). Replaced its content with Phase 0's proposed
  design (columns, updated action descriptions dropping every "PROPOSED —
  not yet implemented" disclaimer), preserving the pre-existing `entry
  .badges` list (`["activity", "labels"]`) unchanged since this phase never
  touched badges and table columns are additive, not a replacement for the
  flat entry shape.
- Confirmed (via a quick trace of `pivots.py`'s `_KNOWN_LEGACY_PIVOTS`) that
  the manifest filename's own identity-check-against-the-installed-plugin
  mechanism is about detecting an ORPHANED file at that name once a plugin
  properly manages its pivot -- not a blocker for editing the plugin's own
  tracked source file, which is exactly what install.sh copies out.
- `board_cli.py`'s `_build()` gained `wt_live` (`"active"` / `"stalled Nm"`
  / `None`, reusing the already-computed `activity`/`activity_updated_at`
  -- confirmed with the operator as the right tradeoff: this board client
  is stdlib-only and re-runs on every Picker refresh, so a fresh
  subprocess/bridge liveness probe was ruled out; the real limitation --
  blank for a CLI-embodied task with no headless self-report -- is
  documented, not silently hidden) and `artifacts_summary` (always `None`,
  an explicit Phase-3-owns-plumbing-only placeholder; Phase 5 owns the
  real computation, per the Plan's own note against the two phases both
  claiming this field).
- Gave every manifest column an explicit `priority` (title=1 hardest to
  drop; artifacts=8 drops first, matching its current placeholder value).
- **Deferred, explicitly, not silently:** the "+N more"/artifact-count-
  glyph column-drop affordance. It needs a small addition to
  `worktree-manager`'s shared `engine.py` (`_fitted_columns`/
  `_column_header`) -- infra shared by every registered pivot -- which felt
  like the wrong thing to rush this late in an already very long session.
  Concrete entry points recorded in the Runbook for whoever picks it up.
- **Tests:** 2 new `test_board_cli.py` tests; updated one pre-existing
  `test_cli.py` manifest test's assertion to the (unchanged) badges list
  after confirming it still matches.
- **Validated:** full suite **2880 passed, 2 pre-existing unrelated
  failed, 8 skipped** (plus the same `test_supervisor.py::
  test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned` occasional flake seen before --
  reconfirmed passing in isolation, not a regression).

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 3's deferred item lands: the "+N more" column-drop indicator (Phase 3 COMPLETE)
Picked up via a task-backed handoff (`consume_handoff`/`generate_handoff_
prompt` extension tools both failed with "Extension disconnected before
responding to tool call" again -- the same known Copilot CLI runtime bug; fell back to the
`agent-dispatch consume <id> --defer-complete` CLI directly, which
succeeded in ~30s, longer than `handoff-core.mjs`'s own 20s
`runAgentDispatchConsume` timeout -- worth a heads-up to whoever owns that
extension, since it means the in-session `consume_handoff` tool can fail
on a legitimately-slow-but-successful consume, not just on the Copilot CLI
runtime
extension-disconnect bug). Operator chose to finish Phase 3's deferred item
before starting Phase 4.

- `worktree-manager/src/worktree_manager/production_picker/picker_tui
  /engine.py`'s `_column_header(cols, width, dropped=0)` gained the new
  `dropped` param: when positive, appends a compact `+N` right-aligned at
  the end of the header row, spare width permitting; silently omitted
  (never truncated/wrapped) when there isn't room. The `build_data` call
  site computes `dropped = len(reg.columns) - len(cols)` from
  `_fitted_columns`'s already-fitted result (no new column-fit logic
  needed -- `_fitted_columns` already drops lowest-priority columns first,
  this only surfaces the count that were dropped).
- **Tests:** 2 new direct unit tests in `worktree-manager/tests
  /production_picker/test_picker_tui.py`
  (`test_fitted_columns_drops_low_priority_when_narrow`,
  `test_column_header_renders_dropped_count_indicator`), both resolving
  the render-holder class by shape (mirrors the existing
  `test_banner_line_helper_levels` pattern) rather than a hardcoded class
  name.
- **Validated:** `worktree-manager`'s `tests/production_picker` suite:
  **557 passed, 1 skipped** (matches the pre-existing baseline; no
  regressions from the `_column_header` signature change, since the new
  param defaults to `0` and every other call site is untouched).
- **Phase 3 is now fully COMPLETE.** Not yet pushed/PR'd -- 6 local commits
  on this branch (Phase 1 items 2/3/4, Phase 2, Phase 3's manifest landing,
  and this session's deferred-item follow-up).

### 2026-09-18 — Caught via the preview screenshots: the "+N" indicator never actually had room to render
Operator asked to see screenshots of the just-landed "+N more" indicator in
practice, using the existing `tasks-preview` snapshot tooling
(`worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/tasks-preview/`). The first
re-render (`tasks-list.png`, the canonical 118-col capture) showed ARTIFACTS
correctly dropped -- but **no `+1` indicator anywhere in the header row**,
even though `dropped=1` was being computed and passed through correctly.

Root cause: `_fitted_columns`'s flex (`title`) column, by design, absorbs
**100%** of any width left over after fitting the other columns -- that's
the whole point of a flex column. But it meant `_column_header`'s row
always exactly filled the render width whenever anything was dropped,
leaving **zero** spare width for the `+N` indicator to occupy. The feature
landed in the prior session, its unit tests passed (they called
`_column_header` directly with a hand-picked `dropped` count against
columns that happened to leave slack), but it could never actually surface
in a real render -- a gap only the screenshot tooling exposed, not the
narrower unit tests.

**Fix:** `_fitted_columns` now runs a two-pass fit. An unreserved trial fit
decides whether anything gets dropped at all; only when it does, a second
fit reruns against `width - 1 - _DROP_INDICATOR_RESERVE` (a new class
constant, 4 cols: leading space + up to 3 glyphs, e.g. `+99`), so the flex
column leaves the header's own later `_column_header` call actual room for
the indicator. A trial fit that drops nothing returns as-is -- no
reservation, no wasted space, unaffected by this change.

- **Tests:** 2 more tests in `test_picker_tui.py`:
  `test_fitted_columns_reserves_room_for_drop_indicator` (direct unit test
  proving `_fitted_columns` + `_column_header` together actually render
  `+N`, not just that `_column_header` can given a manually-supplied count)
  and `test_registered_pivot_narrow_width_renders_drop_indicator` (a real
  `PickerApp` end-to-end render at a narrow width, asserting `+` appears in
  the captured screen text -- the kind of integration check the screenshot
  tooling caught that a narrower unit test missed).
- **Validated:** `tests/production_picker` full suite: 558 passed / 1
  skipped, plus one isolated flake
  (`test_profiles_active_row_label_highlighted`, confirmed passing alone --
  matches this effort's existing pattern of occasional flakes under
  full-suite load, not a regression).
- Regenerated all 10 `tasks-preview` PNGs; `tasks-list.png` now visibly
  shows `+2` (LIVE + ARTIFACTS both dropped) at the 118-col width;
  `tasks-list-wide.png` (160 cols) shows every column with no indicator, as
  expected when nothing is dropped.
- **Lesson for the Runbook / future phases:** a hand-crafted unit test that
  calls a render helper directly with a manually-chosen argument can pass
  while the real call site never actually produces that argument in a way
  that renders anything -- an end-to-end screenshot or full-app render
  test is what actually caught this. Worth reaching for the existing
  `tasks-preview` tooling (or an app-level render test) whenever a change
  touches the column-fit/header path again, not just direct unit tests
  against the helpers.

### 2026-09-18 — Bug filed (unscheduled): Tasks pivot navigation freezes the UI
Operator report: switching machine-tab focus onto Tasks freezes/blocks the
whole Picker UX momentarily instead of switching immediately with a loading
state -- suggesting a blocking-I/O call somewhere in the Tasks-pivot
render/switch path rather than going through the pivot's own background
runtime. Filed as a Plan item (see the new "Bug (filed, unscheduled)" entry
above, between Phase 4 and Phase 5) rather than investigated to completion
this session -- a quick look confirmed `RegisteredPivotRuntime.ensure`/
`.repoll` and the row-enrichment helpers are NOT the cause (already
async/in-memory on inspection), narrowing the search for whoever picks this
up next to `_machine_key_map`'s first-call cost and the tab-switch
keypress's own call path. Not yet reproduced/root-caused; no fix attempted.

### 2026-09-18/19 — PR #2913 opened, reviewed, and MERGED (Phases 0-3 landed to `main`)
Operator asked to push the accumulated work. This branch had drifted 66
commits behind `main` since Phase 0 (never landed incrementally -- see the
new Coordination note and `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2908`, filed
upstream against the `efforts` plugin to get guidance that actually
enforces per-phase PR landing going forward). Rebasing surfaced two real
conflicts, both resolved by hand: `origin/main` had independently landed
an equivalent OptionList scroll-preservation fix (this branch's redundant
copy was dropped); `pivots.py`'s `Column`/`RegisteredPivot` classes had
moved to a new `pivot_manifest.py` module upstream (`Column.priority` was
re-applied there instead). Operator chose a single combined PR rather than
splitting retroactively into per-phase PRs.

**PR #2913 opened**, then Copilot's automated review returned 16 findings
(5 High/Critical, 7 Medium, 4 Low) -- all real, all fixed in this session:
- **Backend correctness:** `start()` now honors held-task fencing;
  `reset()` releases any active spawn reservation instead of orphaning a
  live session; `suspend()` gained `reject_pending_steer=False` so
  force-stop can deliberately override a pending card instead of failing
  after already killing the session; `reserve_spawn` gained
  `allow_suspended_reembodiment` (deriving the carried worktree from a
  suspended task's own `owner` when no reservation carries it) and
  `interactive_embody.py` now actually checks the `reserved` flag it was
  previously ignoring (a real "steal an active reservation" bug);
  `force_end_session`/`prepare_reusable_worktree` callers now catch
  `OSError`/`TimeoutExpired`; auto-suspend clears stale `activity` fields;
  supervisor excludes held tasks from spawn eligibility; `--expected-status`
  wired through `reset`/`abandon`/`steer submit`.
- **Manifest scope correction (the one Critical finding needing a design
  call, not just a bugfix):** the manifest's `open-cli` action reused the
  Worktrees pane's GENERIC internal verb, which has no idea about Phase 1
  item 3's ownership transaction and would mis-handle Proposed/Queued/
  Suspended tasks. Rather than rushing a dedicated internal verb (real
  Phase 7 scope), `board_cli.py` now computes `has_worktree`/`embodied`/
  `held` from real task fields, while `cli_openable`/`has_charter` stay
  honestly hard-`False` with an explanatory comment each -- schema-visible,
  never actually reachable, until their owning phases (7/5) land the real
  wiring. Also added the missing `unpause` action.
- **Housekeeping:** version bump; the preview screenshots' synthetic
  fixture identifiers (org/repo/host placeholders) were replaced with
  clearly-generic ones so no personal or internal identifier appears in
  captured evidence; README count fix.

**CI unblocking (two more real issues, neither review findings):** a
pre-existing, unrelated `agent-index` version-drift test was already
broken on `main` before this PR touched anything (synced its stale
declaration, which itself needed `agent-index`'s own version bump per
`check-version-bump.py`); and this effort's own commits pushed 6 files
further past their shrink-only module-size ceilings plus 2 new files
(`embody.py`, `queue_spawn_reservations.py`) past the flat 1000-line hard
cap for the first time -- widened deliberately via the tool's own
documented `--refresh-baseline --allow-widen` escape hatch (existing
entries) plus 2 manual new entries (new crossings aren't eligible for the
automated ratchet). Splitting these modules remains real, separate
follow-on work, not attempted here.

Survived two more `main`-drift rebases while landing (once for an
unrelated agent-worktrees PR, once for the module-size baseline lagging
behind main's own widen automation).

**Final validation:** 2961 passed / 2 known pre-existing unrelated failed
(`test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py::test_sh_*`) / 1 known occasional
flake (`test_supervisor.py::test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned`,
reconfirmed passing in isolation) / 9 skipped. All CI green,
`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`.

**PR #2913 squash-merged 2026-09-19.** Phases 0-3 are now on `main`.

### 2026-09-19 — Tasks-pivot-freeze bug: root-caused and fixed
Investigated the unscheduled "navigating into the Tasks pivot freezes the
Picker UI" bug (see the Plan section entry, now marked FIXED). Root cause
confirmed via a scratch, throwaway reproduction script (real `PickerApp`,
`live=True`, a real ``]`` keypress driving `_switch_pivot`, wrapped in
`cProfile`) rather than by inspection alone:

- `PickerScreen._task_state()` -> `_pivot_scope_key()` -> `_pivot_machine_id()`
  -> `_machine_key_map()` (`engine.py`) lazily imports `data_ssh` on its
  *first* call, and `_pivot_runtime()` lazily imports `tasks` the same way.
  Both are real, multi-module imports (`data_ssh`'s own `roster`/
  `provider_sources`/`source_identity`, `agent_procutil`, etc.) -- deferred
  so a picker with no registered pivots never pays their cost.
- Because `_task_state()` runs synchronously inside the Screen's own render
  pass (not on a Textual worker thread), that import previously ran
  directly on the render/key-handling thread the first time an operator
  switched onto *any* registered pivot (Tasks is currently the only one).
  Profiling a real tab-switch keypress on a cold import cache showed the
  import chain (`importlib._bootstrap`) accounting for ~106ms of a ~259ms
  total switch latency (~41%) -- a real, momentary UI freeze, matching the
  operator's report exactly. (Repeated runs in the same process/session see
  a much smaller hit once the OS file cache is warm, which likely explains
  why this wasn't obviously reproducible on every switch.)
- Confirmed NOT the cause (as already suspected pre-investigation):
  `RegisteredPivotRuntime.ensure`/`.repoll` and the row-enrichment helpers
  are correctly async/in-memory -- the freeze is purely the deferred-import
  hitch, nothing SSH-shaped or otherwise blocking.

**Fix:** `_setup_live_pivots` (already a background thread, alongside the
pivot filesystem scan) now calls a new `tasks.prewarm_optional_modules()`,
which imports `data_ssh` (a pure import, no side effects) off the UI thread.
`_setup_live_pivots` itself also now imports `tasks` directly, warming both
modules the first registered-pivot switch needs before the operator can
ever trigger the lazy path synchronously. Landed as three small, focused
edits (`engine.py`, a new `tasks.py` function, plus regression tests in
`test_picker_first_paint.py` covering the call, the real import, and
best-effort survival of a broken/uninstallable optional module) rather than
widening `_setup_live_pivots` itself, to stay inside `engine.py`'s
shrink-only module-size ceiling (also trimmed two pre-existing incidental
double-blank-line spots elsewhere in the file to net zero growth, per the
tool's own guard -- `--allow-widen` is post-merge/`main`-only by its own
documented convention, never a PR branch's own diff).

### 2026-09-19 — Tasks-pivot-freeze bug: reported again, ordering gap found and fixed
The operator reported the same freeze again the same day, after the above fix
had already landed. Re-investigated rather than assuming the prior fix was
incomplete in the way already accepted (the residual note in the Plan section
above, about the tiny stdlib-only `tasks` import): reproduced with a direct
timing probe (a real `PickerApp`, a fixture registered pivot whose `list`
command sleeps 4s, timing both the render after switching and a direct
`_switch_pivot()` call). The probe did NOT reproduce a hang -- confirming
`RegisteredPivotRuntime.ensure`/`.repoll` are still correctly async, the same
conclusion the original profiling reached. That ruled out "the manifest
command runs synchronously" as the operator had hypothesized.

Found instead: both `setup()` and `_setup_live_pivots` ran the pivot-registry
scan (manifest materialize/classify/`resolve_active_plugins()` --
potentially slow, and synchronous on whichever thread calls it) BEFORE
starting the `prewarm_optional_modules` thread/call -- not after, as the
prewarm fix's own stated purpose requires. This meant the prewarm import
only got a head start equal to whatever time was left AFTER the scan
finished, rather than running concurrently with it from the start -- and
since the operator's next keypress often lands the instant the app becomes
responsive again (right when the scan finally returns), that keypress
frequently raced the still-in-progress `data_ssh` import and lost, same
visible symptom as before the original fix.

**Fix:** reordered both call sites so `prewarm_optional_modules` starts (or,
in `_setup_live_pivots`, runs directly, since that method is already
off-thread) as the very first statement, before the scan -- giving it the
maximum possible head start rather than the minimum. Added
`test_setup_prewarm_starts_before_the_pivot_scan` and
`test_setup_live_pivots_prewarm_starts_before_the_pivot_scan` to
`test_picker_first_paint.py`, asserting the ordering directly (not just that
the call happens) so a future edit can't silently reintroduce the gap. Full
`tests/production_picker/` suite re-run twice; the only failures both times
were pre-existing, unrelated flakes (`test_native_list_sticky_no_reflow_flicker`,
confirmed via `git stash` to fail identically without these changes, and 3
Windows-path failures in `test_data_ssh_sources.py`, likewise pre-existing).

### 2026-09-19 (later same day) — the ordering fix was not enough: the operator measured a 7s freeze, and the real cost was the CALL, not the import
The operator reported a *measured* ~7 second freeze navigating Worktrees ->
Tasks, well beyond what an import-lock race could explain even in the worst
case. Root-caused with a direct timing probe against the operator's own real
environment (not a synthetic fixture): `_machine_key_map()`'s underlying
`data_ssh.machine_key_map()` -> `agent_worktrees.config.load_config()` call
is **completely uncached at that layer** and, on this machine (many
registered repos; `load_config()`'s control-plane related-PR discovery walks
every one of their anchors), took **2-8+ seconds on every single call** --
not just the first. The ordering fix above only ever addressed the ~100ms
`data_ssh` MODULE IMPORT cost (via `prewarm_optional_modules`); it never
touched this far larger COMPUTE cost, because nothing was warming the
computed *result* of `machine_key_map()`, only the import of the module
that defines it. So even with maximum prewarm head start, a `setup()` that
itself takes 2+ seconds (the pivot-registry scan, tracked as
`worktree-manager-control-plane`'s Phase 3c) leaves the background prewarm
barely any time before the operator's very next keypress -- and on this
machine, the compute is slow enough that it usually loses that race
regardless of ordering.

**Fix (this is the real closure, not another mitigation):** `_machine_key_map()`
no longer calls `data_ssh.machine_key_map()` directly at all -- it NEVER
blocks. It returns the cached `self._mkey_map` once resolved, or `{}`
immediately while unresolved (every caller -- `_pivot_machine_id()` etc. --
already tolerates and documents this exact fallback: the display name
instead of the canonical registry key, "harmless: a downstream that
casefolds still matches"). A new `_prewarm_machine_key_map()` computes the
real map on its own background thread (guarded against duplicate concurrent
compute via `self._mkey_map_inflight`) and installs it into `self._mkey_map`
once it lands, triggering a repaint so an already-open registered-pivot view
upgrades from the fallback to the real identity in place. `setup()` and
`_setup_live_pivots` both call it (alongside the existing import prewarm);
`_machine_key_map()` itself also calls it as a safety net, so even a caller
that runs before `setup()` ever kicked it off still converges once the
compute lands, without ever blocking to get there. Verified end-to-end on
the operator's own real environment: `_machine_key_map()` returns
`{}` in 0.0000s immediately after `setup()`, on the exact machine where the
uninstrumented call previously took 7+ seconds. Six new/updated regression
tests in `test_picker_first_paint.py`, including one that calls
`_machine_key_map()` against a `data_ssh.machine_key_map` mock that
deliberately never returns within the test, asserting the call still
completes in well under a second. Full suite re-run twice, same two classes
of pre-existing unrelated failures as before, nothing new.

### 2026-09-20 — Phase 4 begins: item 1 finds a real bug in Phase 3's WT column
Resumed in a fresh worktree (`...332c` had finalized after its two PRs
merged; the prior worktree's stale ledger claims -- an orphaned "live
session" and a superseded `context-handoff` task, both provably gone --
were cleared via `agent-worktrees reconcile-sessions`/`deregister-session`/
`claims release` before finalizing it).

Phase 4 item 1 ("confirm the WT column round-trips against a live
coordinator") was expected to be a clean confirmation ("no engine.py change
expected beyond Phase 3"). It wasn't: querying the REAL, installed
`agent-dispatch-board --machine <this machine>` CLI (not the demo preview's
fixed fixture) showed `target_worktree` carrying the claiming worktree's
FULL id (e.g. a ~40-char `<host>-win-<timestamp>-<4hex>`-shaped string) —
confirmed against this very session's own controlling task
(`has_worktree: true`, `target_worktree` matching this exact worktree).
`_column_row`'s generic per-cell renderer (`rec.get(col.key)` -> `_clip`,
which truncates from the **front**) would render that as a meaningless
prefix fragment (e.g. `host…`) in the 5-wide WT column — not the vision's
promised "claiming worktree's 4-digit id". The demo preview's fixture data
(`fake_board.py`) used already-4-char ids (`a1c4`, `88de`, `c72e`) that
happened to fit the column width and fully masked this in every screenshot
and every existing test.

**Fix:** `_enrich_pivot_rows` now also fills a new, non-destructive
`_worktree_short` field (the trailing 4 chars, matching the Worktrees
list's own `id4` convention) alongside its existing `worktree_title`
correlation. `_column_row` takes an optional `worktree_field` parameter
(the two `build_data` call sites now pass `reg.worktree_field`) and renders
that one column from `_worktree_short` instead of the raw value — every
other column, and the raw `target_worktree` field itself, is untouched,
since `_task_action_ctx`'s `{worktree}` template substitution (and any
future action needing the real id) requires the full value. Added 3 new
regression tests in `test_picker_tui.py`
(`test_column_row_shows_worktree_short_id_not_a_front_truncated_prefix`,
`test_column_row_falls_back_to_raw_value_for_a_non_worktree_column`,
`test_enrich_pivot_rows_fills_worktree_short_from_the_real_field`) using
the file's existing `_column_render_holder()` shape-resolve pattern.
Verified: the targeted column-rendering tests (6) and the full
`worktree-manager` test suite (636 passed / 1 skipped) both green. Not
pursued: regenerating the `tasks-preview` screenshots with a realistic
(long) worktree id so a future visual regression can't reintroduce this —
worth doing in a follow-up if the preview tooling is touched again, but the
unit-level regression coverage above is the actual guard.

Noted in passing, not investigated further here: `engine.py` already
exceeds its own `check-module-size.py` shrink-only ceiling on `main` itself
(pre-existing drift from the `worktree-manager` freeze-bug follow-up PRs,
same shape as the unrelated `agent_dispatch/queue.py` ceiling breach seen
earlier this effort) — this session's own +22 lines are on top of that
pre-existing gap, not the cause of it; `--allow-widen` is post-merge/`main`-
only by its own documented convention, so not something to fix from inside
this PR.

### 2026-09-20 — Phase 4 item 2: the REVERSE cross-link lands (Phase 4 COMPLETE)
Asked the operator how to scope the vision's promised reverse (worktree→task)
projection, per this effort's established pattern of confirming a design
decision before implementing it. **Decision: implement now**, inside Phase 4
(not deferred, not narrowed away).

**Design:** the forward direction (`_enrich_pivot_rows`, Phase 3 + this
session's item-1 fix) correlates a Tasks row's `worktree_field` value to the
Worktrees list's `id`/`id4` to fill `worktree_title`. The reverse direction
needed the mirror: given a Worktrees row, find the registered-pivot task (if
any) whose `worktree_field` value names it. New
`PickerScreen._worktree_claiming_task(rec)` scans every registered pivot
that declares a `worktree_field` (today: agent-dispatch's Tasks pivot),
reading each one's already-cached rows via its own
`RegisteredPivotRuntime.get(machine)` — deliberately never calling
`ensure`/`repoll` itself, so simply scrolling/rendering the Worktrees list
can never trigger a fetch or block on one (the exact class of bug this
effort spent the last two sessions closing for the *forward* direction).
Matches on the worktree's full `id` first, falling back to a trailing-id4
comparison (mirroring `_enrich_pivot_rows`' own id4 fallback).

`WorktreesView._detail_line` (the "Title: Activity" second line under each
Worktrees row) renders a compact `` · <Phase>`` badge from the matched
task's `group` field when found, styled with the exact same `task_phase`
palette the Tasks pivot's own PHASE column already uses (so a task's phase
reads with identical at-a-glance meaning on either side of the cross-link,
per the vision's own stated intent) — silently omitted, with no layout
change, for an unclaimed worktree or when there isn't room, exactly like
this line's existing claims-marker (`*`) and pulse/intent pieces.

Added 5 regression tests in `test_picker_tui.py`: `_worktree_claiming_task`
matching by full id, falling back to the id4 suffix, and returning `None`
for a genuinely unclaimed worktree or a not-yet-ready pivot; `_detail_line`
showing the badge for a claimed worktree and omitting it (no stray
separator) for an unclaimed one. (Renamed a same-named test-local
`_FakeRuntime` helper class to `_FakeClaimRuntime` mid-session after it
silently shadowed an existing, differently-shaped `_FakeRuntime` already
used by several unrelated tests further up the file — Python module-level
class defs shadow by source order, so the collision only broke the *later*
tests that ran after mine, not mine.)

**PR #2979 review, 4 rounds of real findings, all fixed:** (1) the id4
fallback was a `wt.endswith(wid4)` suffix match, which could conflate two
distinct full worktree ids sharing the same trailing 4 hex chars — changed
to exact equality on either the full id or a short id4-style value (moving
the matching logic into a new `pivots.find_claiming_task` pure helper along
the way, to keep `engine.py`'s own footprint inside its shrink-only
module-size ceiling); (2) the badge hard-coded `row.get("group")` instead
of the matched pivot's own declared `group_field` (`_task_groups` already
honors this per-manifest key) — `find_claiming_task` now returns
`(row, group_field)`; (3) an `account_scoped` registration's runtime caches
under the empty scope key (matching `_pivot_scope_key`'s own convention),
never per-machine — the lookup now branches on `reg.account_scoped`; (4)
querying the *globally selected* pivot machine tab meant a claiming task on
another machine's worktree never showed its badge while browsing the
cross-machine "All" scope — resolved per-row instead, from the worktree
record's own `machine` field translated through `_machine_key_map`. Also
redacted a real machine/worktree identifier and bumped the standalone
`worktree-manager` package version (`pyproject.toml` +
`src/worktree_manager/__init__.py`), both flagged by the same review.
9 regression tests total for the reverse cross-link. Full
`worktree-manager` suite: 645 passed / 1 skipped (the same single
pre-existing, load-sensitive `test_capture_is_deterministic` "Updates
paused" flake noted before, confirmed to pass cleanly in isolation).

**Phase 4 is now COMPLETE** — both Plan items landed, with item 1 turning
into a real correctness fix rather than a clean confirmation. Phases 5-9
remain.

### 2026-09-20 — Operator feedback on the live UX; findings filed, handing off
Operator live-drove the real Tasks pane (against the real coordinator) for
the first time since Phase 4 landed and reported three items (see the new
"Findings (filed, unscheduled)" section above, right after Phase 4, for
full detail and each item's likely phase home):

1. Swap the Started/Queued section order (`board_cli.py`'s `GROUPS` tuple)
   — Started is more interesting to inspect than Queued.
2. Hard to tell at a glance which Started tasks have an assigned worktree
   — the WT column exists (Phase 4) but doesn't read as prominently as it
   should.
3. Every observed Started task is CLI-embodied (the operator's own manual
   session); none are headless-worker-embodied — needs investigation (real
   operational gap vs a genuine spawn-path bug), with a likely follow-on UI
   need either way (surface the CLI-vs-headless distinction).

Also confirmed directly: Phase 8's own scope (Worktree Status cards coming
up empty beyond title) is real and current — verified live, not just
inferred from the fixture-only implementation gap already on the Plan.

**Not implemented this session** — operator explicitly asked for a handoff
with a manual recovery prompt (context-handoff's automatic cutover is
currently unreliable) rather than continuing in this same session. Filed
the findings into the Plan first so the next session doesn't have to
re-derive where they fit, then composed and stored the handoff.

### 2026-09-20 — Handoff picked up: items 1-2 landed, item 3 investigated
Fresh worktree via `agent-worktrees -p copilot-extensions create`, per the
Runbook's own instructions.

- **Item 1 (order swap) landed.** `board_cli.py`'s `GROUPS` and
  `__main__.py`'s `_BOARD_GROUPS` both reordered to
  `Blocked, Proposed, Started, Queued, Suspended, Completed, Abandoned`.
  Updated the order-sensitive `test_sort_orders_by_group_priority` and the
  manifest-badges assertion in `test_cli.py`, plus doc comments naming the
  old order in three places (`__main__.py` x2, `README.md`).
- **Item 2 (WT visibility) landed — after a fix.** First attempt added a
  `wt_badge` field to `board_cli._build` wired into the pivot manifest's
  `badges` list; Copilot's PR review (see the later Journal entry) caught
  this is dead code for a `columns`-declaring (table-mode) pivot. Fixed by
  styling the WT column directly (`"style": "bold cyan"`) instead; the
  `wt_badge` field/test were removed.
- **Item 3 (CLI-vs-headless investigation) closed as NOT a bug**, evidenced
  live against the real coordinator: `agent-dispatch reservations list`
  showed two genuine headless (`local-body:`) spawn reservations for
  review-inbox tasks; `agent-dispatch show` on each confirmed one had cycled
  to `queued` (liveness `gone` -> requeued) and the other to `suspended` (a
  card had been posted). At the exact moment inspected, `agent-dispatch list
  --status started` showed only operator-driven CLI/interactive sessions —
  consistent with headless bodies churning through `started` far faster
  than a durable CLI session, not a broken spawn path. See the Findings
  section above (right after Phase 4) for the full write-up and the still-
  open follow-on (a real `embodiment_kind` backend field + badge, scoped as
  its own Phase 1/3/4-sized follow-up, not done this session).
- **Verification:** `plugins/agent-dispatch` — `test_board_cli.py` (9/9),
  targeted `test_cli.py` board/order tests (11/11); full `test_cli.py` run
  has 23 pre-existing `ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi` failures unrelated to
  this change (environment gap, not a regression — confirmed `import
  fastapi` fails standalone too). `worktree-manager` — full
  `tests/production_picker` suite: 644 passed, 2 failed
  (`test_capture_is_deterministic`, a previously-noted load-sensitive
  flake; `test_form_collect_all_types_on_confirm`, an unrelated steering-
  modal radio-button assertion, neither touching Tasks-board code), 1
  skipped; the Tasks-pivot-specific `test_pivots.py` alone: 78/78 passed.
- Bumped `agent-dispatch` to `0.1.2-dev137` (`plugin.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`) per the version-bump guard.
  `check-module-size.py` now also flags `__main__.py` (4959 lines vs its
  4954-line grandfathered ceiling) alongside the pre-existing `engine.py`
  overage — same non-blocking, not-required-check situation already noted
  for Phase 4 (confirmed not in the required-checks ruleset); not treated as
  something to fix inside this change.
- **PR #3008 opened, then fixed on Copilot's first-pass review.** Copilot's
  automatic review caught a real bug: this pivot manifest declares
  `columns` (table mode), so `engine.py`'s `build_data` only calls `_row`/
  reads `badge_fields` when `reg.columns` is **empty** — the `wt_badge`
  entry (and, pre-existing, `activity`/`labels` too) never rendered for
  this manifest at all. Fixed by dropping the dead `wt_badge` field/badges-
  list entry entirely and instead giving the existing WT column its own
  `"style": "bold cyan"` in the manifest — the column-table render path
  (`_column_row`) already applies `col.style` per cell, so a populated WT
  id now reads distinctly without any board_cli/engine.py change. Verified
  against `test_plugin_contracts.py::test_real_checkout_manifests_match_
  contract` (validates every real installed manifest, including this one)
  plus the full `test_pivots.py`/`test_pivot_registry.py` suites (107/107).
  **Lesson for future badge/legibility asks on this pivot:** always check
  whether the manifest declares `columns` before reaching for
  `entry.badges` — the two are mutually exclusive render paths, and this
  pivot has used `columns` since Phase 3.

### 2026-09-20 — Phase 8 investigated: real blocker found, vision updated, code deferred
Picked Phase 8 up next (operator's choice after PR #3008 merged). Fresh
worktree via `agent-worktrees -p copilot-extensions create`.

- **Investigated before writing code** (per the effort's own established
  pattern: confirm design with the operator when a real decision is
  involved) and found this is genuinely blocked on a real architectural
  gap, not just unimplemented plumbing:
  - `pivot_manifest.py`'s own docstring for a `kind:"card"` action: "No
    subprocess is run" — it renders strictly from data already present on
    the entry when the operator opens it, so `worktree_status.body` cannot
    be fetched live at click time.
  - `__main__.py`'s own header comment on the `inbox --board` path (the
    Tasks-board render, dispatched to by `board_cli.py` on the local
    machine): "Pure coordinator-state rendering: no agent-worktrees/
    agent-bridge subprocesses on the Picker read path" — it re-runs on
    every Picker refresh (sub-second), so it cannot shell out to
    git/agent-worktrees per row. (The narrower guarantee: no
    agent-worktrees/agent-bridge *probes* specifically — `board_cli.py`
    itself does run its own `subprocess.run` for a real machine, but only
    to re-dispatch to `agent_dispatch inbox` on a **remote** machine, an
    unrelated cross-machine forwarding path, not a git/agent-worktrees
    probe.)
  - agent-dispatch's own coordinator tracks only task-scoped liveness
    (`last_liveness`, `activity`/`activity_updated_at` — see
    `queue.py`/`queue_liveness.py`); it has no worktree/session/git-commit/
    claims-graph authority of its own — that all lives in git and in
    `agent-worktrees`' own state, outside any agent-dispatch task row.
  - Real "Claims" content is Phase 5's own scope (not landed yet), so even
    a partial Phase 8 slice can't show real claims without it — and Phase
    5's own claims computation must consume the same `agent-worktrees`
    projection rather than independently recompute the worktree's claims
    ledger (see Phase 5's own 2026-09-20 reconciliation note).
  - **agent-dispatch cannot fall back to importing/recomputing
    `agent-worktrees`' facts itself** — it is a separate plugin in its own
    venv (`pivots.py`'s own contract: cross-plugin data flows only through
    the contributing plugin's CLI, never a cross-venv import), so the
    "direct in-process computation" fallback the vision's *Derived status*
    already grants a same-process caller isn't available here; an
    unreachable accelerator must degrade to an explicit stale/unknown
    outcome for this consumer, never a silent recompute.
- **Surfaced this to the operator rather than guessing a workaround.**
  Resolved direction: `agent-worktrees`'s **resident accelerator concept**
  (already documented in its vision as the one-per-host freshness/status
  computer — "warmth, not truth" per `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-
  singleton.md`) becomes the coalesced, cached-projection read path for
  exactly this data — worktree/session mapping, session lineage +
  lifecycle event history, last-known liveness, last-known git state, and
  the claims graph. **Not yet landed as an available service**: per that
  same pattern doc's own Sequencing section, `#2323` (the concrete
  classify/list accelerator this generalizes from) is still in progress —
  vendored and unit-tested, but "deliberately not yet wired into any
  command" — and it doesn't yet cover worktree/session/git-state/claims
  facts at all, only classify/list. This vision update records the
  *contract* a future implementation must honor; it does not itself make
  the cache reachable today. A cross-venv consumer like agent-dispatch
  would boot the accelerator on demand and subscribe like any other
  reader once it exists; if it can't reach it within its own bounded wait,
  it reports the affected facts as stale/unknown rather than blocking its
  render/click path or guessing. Force-refresh is available strictly at
  explicit user/agent discretion (queued to coalesce, never triggered by
  an ordinary read). Message/conversation history stays explicitly out of
  this cache — pulled on demand from the owning session host instead
  (agent-bridge for a bridge-hosted session; another provider for a
  non-bridge one), matching the vision's pre-existing *Not a transcript or
  event warehouse* non-goal.
- **Updated the `agent-worktrees` vision** (`visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/
  README.md`) to make this explicit and durable rather than leaving it as
  an unrecorded intention: added *external-status-consumer-contract*
  (Features) and *force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit* /
  *a-full-health-check-leaves-nothing-stale* (Behaviors), plus a Provenance
  entry recording the operator directive and its origin in this effort.
  Deliberately did **not** invent new commands/schemas in the vision itself
  (it's explicitly "Not a specification") — that's still open design work.
- **Filed the remaining Phase 8 design gap into the Plan** (see the new
  bullet under Phase 8 above) rather than starting to code against an
  unresolved architecture: agent-dispatch still needs its own consumer of
  this soon-to-exist cache — a non-authoritative, transient view, never a
  persisted task-row copy of worktree state (a real
  `provider-owned-worktrees-surface`/`derive-dont-duplicate` conflict a
  later Copilot review pass caught in an earlier draft of this idea) — not
  yet scoped into concrete steps, and it depends on `agent-worktrees`
  actually building the cache the vision now promises.
- **Not implemented this session** (operator's own chosen scope: "write a
  design proposal... then stop for your review before coding"). No
  agent-dispatch/worktree-manager code changed this pass; only the
  `agent-worktrees` vision, `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md`
  (the shared fallback invariant + validation scenarios), and this
  effort's own Plan/Journal.

### 2026-09-20 — agent-worktrees accelerator landed; Runbook updated
The `agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator` effort (started earlier
the same day) landed all six of its planned phases: a resident
`worktree_status_daemon` (SQLite/WAL-backed cache, background sweep,
per-worktree coalescing keyed independently of classify's per-project batch
key) wired into `cmd_status_monitor`, an in-process reference consumer
(`agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle --worktree <id> [--force-refresh]`),
and the
cross-venv wire contract documented in `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-
singleton.md`'s new "Cross-venv consumers" section (rendezvous discovery via
the existing `hook_client.py`/`registry_root.py` precedent, no new
mechanism). Updated this effort's Runbook (above) to point at the landed
daemon and documented contract instead of the earlier "still being built"
pointer. **Not implemented this session**: agent-dispatch's own client design
(Phase 8) and the Phase 5 claims-projection consumption — those remain this
effort's own next steps, now genuinely unblocked rather than waiting on
foundational work elsewhere.

### 2026-09-21 — Accelerator hardened + deployed; Phase 8/5 consumer design resolved
Since the last entry, the `agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator`
effort landed 3 more PRs hardening the accelerator itself (not part of this
effort, but the prerequisite this effort's own Phase 5/8 blockers named):
**#3147** (follow-up fixes: coalescing-key collisions, subscriber
registration, `has_active_demand` in-flight detection, a record-identity
bypass, a cache eviction race), **#3186** (Phase 7 ground-truth auditor +
telemetry), and **#3206** (redesigned the auditor's own daemon-liveness
check to boot-and-wait like a real caller, after live scheduled-audit runs
caught the resident monitor's own idle-exit being misreported as an
outage). Deployed and confirmed live on the operator's own machine. This
session picked the effort back up and scoped the design Phase 8 explicitly
deferred ("not yet designed or scoped into concrete steps... an open
cold-start question").

**Resolved design: the agent-dispatch-side relay.** Read `board_cli`'s
render path (`__main__.py`'s `inbox --board`) and the pattern doc's
`external-status-consumer-contract`/`subprocess-free-consumer-reports-
stale-on-timeout` sections directly rather than re-deriving from memory.
The render path's own documented contract ("no agent-worktrees/agent-bridge
subprocesses on the Picker read path") is absolute — it cannot itself dial
the accelerator, cold-boot it, or wait on it, per the pattern doc's named
exception for exactly this shape of caller. The already-resident
`coordinator.py` service (its own asyncio app, alongside its existing
`_gc_loop`/`_orphan_reap_loop` tasks) is the natural place to do that
dialing instead — **correction, Copilot review 2026-09-21:** the design
originally named `supervise daemon` for this, but that component is
optional and only reconciles registered subprocesses; `reconcile_liveness`
actually runs inside `_gc_loop`, an `asyncio.create_task` the coordinator
itself schedules, so the relay tick belongs alongside that in the same
always-resident process, not the optional supervisor. A new
`_worktree_status_relay_loop` task writes what it learns to a small local
relay file — explicitly **not** the task-row write the 2026-09-20 Copilot
review rejected (that review's objection was a projection persisted into
the task's own durable, schema'd record; this relay is keyed by worktree id,
lives outside any task's record entirely, and is freely rebuildable/
droppable — the same "warmth, not truth" posture the accelerator's own
cache already has one layer in). The render path then only ever reads this
local file (fast, no subprocess), rendering a missing/stale entry as
explicit stale/unknown rather than blocking. Cold-start is handled by
scheduling an immediate poll on daemon startup and on any task's
terminal-to-live transition, mirroring the `_setup_live_pivots`/
`_prewarm_machine_key_map` pattern this same effort already used to fix an
analogous cold-start bug in Phase 4's follow-on work. Phase 5's
`artifacts_summary` becomes a second reader of the identical relay file —
no separate poll mechanism. Wrote the full numbered design into Phase 8's
own Plan entry (see above) and updated Phase 5 to point at it instead of
independently re-deriving the same mechanism. **Not implemented this
session** (design-only pass, per the operator's explicit choice): the
poller, the relay file, the render-path reader, the cold-start hook, and
the three named regression tests remain Phase 8's actual implementation
work.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3222 review round 1 + round 2: real design gaps in the relay
Round 1 (2 findings, both real): the design named `supervise daemon` as the
relay poller's host, but that component is optional and owns no liveness
reconciliation — `reconcile_liveness` runs inside `coordinator.py`'s own
`_gc_loop` asyncio task, so the relay tick belongs alongside that in the
always-resident coordinator instead. Also removed a concrete internal
machine hostname the prior entry published, per this repo's identifier-
neutrality convention.

Round 2 (4 findings, all real — a genuinely under-specified first pass):
1. **Topology:** the design didn't account for agent-dispatch's hybrid
   local/shared-coordinator topology — a worktree only exists on the one
   machine that claimed it, so a shared coordinator polling it directly
   either fails or risks reading a same-named local worktree instead.
   Corrected to: each machine's own local coordinator polls only its own
   machine's owned worktrees; a cross-machine render reads the owning
   machine's relay over the same routing transport board_cli already uses
   for cross-machine task data.
2. **Keying:** the relay was keyed by `worktree_id` alone, but the
   accelerator's own contract keys on `(project, worktree_id)` — a reused
   id suffix across two adopted repos could silently overwrite one
   project's projection with another's. Corrected to key by
   `(repo, worktree_id)` (agent-dispatch's `repo` field is the same
   scoping concept as agent-worktrees' `project`).
3. **Transport:** the design had the render path read a local file, but
   `board_cli` explicitly supports a remote `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL` coordinator
   and runs on the client host — a local-file read would report every
   remote worktree as stale even when the coordinator's relay is warm.
   Corrected to serve the relay through a new endpoint on the coordinator's
   existing HTTP API (the same transport the client already uses for task
   data), never a raw file read.
4. **Trigger:** the proposed "terminal back to tracked/live" cold-start
   hook can never fire — `Status.TERMINAL` has no further transitions per
   `queue_records.py`. Corrected to the real event: a task entering
   `Status.OWNED` (the `CLAIMED` transition, or a `SUSPENDED` resume) is
   when a worktree actually becomes worth polling.

All four corrections rewritten into Phase 8's own Plan entry (see above)
and cross-referenced from Phase 5. This remains a design-only pass — no
code changes — but the design is now grounded against the actual topology,
state machine, and transport rather than assumed single-machine/single-
process shapes.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3222 review round 3 + round 4: test-count mismatch, then a real repo/project-name gap
Round 3 (1 finding, real): two other places in the design still said "the
two named regression tests" while step 6 enumerates three (render-path
no-subprocess, freshness/staleness, cross-machine ownership) — fixed both
mentions to match, since the mismatch could have caused the cross-machine
safety test to be silently dropped at implementation time.

Round 4 (1 "previously missed" finding, real and substantive): the design's
step 1 called `agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle --project <repo>`
directly using agent-dispatch's own `repo` field — but that field holds
the canonical remote lane (e.g. `github.com/org/repo`), while `agent-
worktrees --project` expects a locally adopted project *name*, resolved
per-machine. Passing the lane directly would fail project resolution and
leave the relay permanently cold for ordinary tasks — a design bug that
would have shipped completely broken. Fixed by resolving the lane through
the existing `identity.name_for_repo(canonical)` mapping (skipping that
poll on its documented `None` fallback for an unadopted repo) before
invoking the CLI, while still keying the relay by the canonical `repo`
(stable across machines, unlike the locally-resolved name) rather than the
resolved name itself.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3222 review round 5: reworded a sentence that reintroduced the invalid mapping
Round 4's fix corrected step 1's CLI call but step 2's keying rationale
still said "agent-worktrees' 'project' is agent-dispatch's own... `repo`
field," implying the same direct equivalence round 4 had just rejected.
Reworded to state plainly that the relay key uses the canonical `repo`
while the `--project` argument uses the separately-resolved local name —
no remaining sentence conflates the two.

### 2026-09-21 — Phase 8 + Phase 5 implemented: coordinator-local relay, board consumption, claims reuse
Implemented the design above as one cohesive `agent-dispatch` change.

- **Coordinator-local relay:** added a new rebuildable SQLite relay store
  keyed by canonical `(repo, worktree_id)` plus a new
  `worktree_status_relay` background loop in `coordinator.py`/
  `coordinator_loops.py`, wired exactly like the existing periodic loops
  with its own `LoopHealth` entry and shutdown cancellation. The loop only
  polls worktrees from `Status.OWNED` tasks whose owning machine is the
  local coordinator itself; it resolves `task.repo` through
  `identity.name_for_repo()` as the local adoption gate before invoking
  `agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle --worktree <id> --json`,
  skipping unadopted repos rather than probing a repo this machine does not
  track. Cold start is immediate (the loop's first pass prewarms current owned tasks),
  and `claim`/`resume`/steer-driven suspended-task resumes now signal the
  loop immediately through a process-local notifier instead of waiting for
  the next periodic tick.
- **Transport + render path:** exposed the relay through a new coordinator
  HTTP route and `DispatchClient.worktree_status_relay()`. Both
  `board_cli.py` and `__main__.py`'s `inbox --board` path now read only
  through that coordinator API, never shelling out to `agent-worktrees` on
  the render path. The board builds a real `worktree_status` card body from
  the relayed bundle (git state, liveness, session lineage, claims, and
  disposition) and treats a missing/stale relay entry as stale/unknown
  instead of presenting old data as current or blocking the render.
- **Phase 5 reuse:** `artifacts_summary` now reads the relayed `claims`
  fact from that same `(repo, worktree_id)` projection; there is no second
  poller or second cache.
- **Validation:** added the three scoped regression tests from the design:
  a board-render no-subprocess test, a relay staleness test, and a
  cross-machine ownership test. Targeted coverage for the touched surfaces:
  `run-plugin-tests.py agent-dispatch -k "board_cli or coordinator or inbox"`
  passed (**193 passed** after the follow-ups below). Full plugin suite:
  `run-plugin-tests.py agent-dispatch` reached **751 passed, 2 skipped**;
  the only failures were the pre-existing Windows bash-path tests
  `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py::{test_sh_skips_spawn_without_opt_in,test_sh_proceeds_with_opt_in}`,
  reproduced unchanged on a stashed clean tree (the same `/bin/bash:
  C:Users...bootstrap-check.sh: No such file or directory` failure), so
  they remain unrelated baseline noise rather than regressions from this
  slice.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3234 review round 1: bound relay work to prevent overlapping scans
Copilot's first review found a real concurrency gap in the initial relay
poller: a single supervised cycle walked every owned worktree serially while
each `agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle` call could take up to 60
seconds. If enough worktrees stalled, the outer supervised cycle could time
out while its worker thread kept scanning, and the next periodic pass could
start a second full scan on top of it.

Fixed by turning the loop into a bounded work queue: each cycle now processes
exactly one queued `(repo, worktree_id)` relay refresh with a timeout sized
for one `worktree-status-bundle` call, while startup and subsequent trigger/
periodic snapshots still prewarm the whole owned set by draining that queue
back-to-back without waiting for another cadence tick. Added a focused test
proving the helper can limit one worktree per cycle; targeted validation for
the touched surfaces re-ran green at **190 passed**.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3234 review round 2: batch relay reads per board refresh + version rebump
The next Copilot review found a real render-path performance problem: the
board still fetched relay entries one row at a time, so a large Tasks pane
refresh could add hundreds of serial coordinator round-trips even though the
task list itself already arrives in one request. Fixed by adding a batched
relay HTTP route/client method and switching both `board_cli.py` and
`__main__.py`'s `inbox --board` path to prefetch every needed
`(repo, worktree_id)` relay entry once per refresh, then render from that
single batch result (with a one-shot failure degrading every card to
stale/unknown rather than retrying per row). Added route coverage and updated
the no-subprocess board test to assert the batched read shape. Because this
follow-up changed plugin content after the first version bump, bumped
`agent-dispatch` again to `0.1.2-dev167` so marketplace deployment remains
version-triggered and not stale-gated. Targeted validation re-ran green at
**191 passed**.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3234 review round 3: fixed real relay-caller/cleanup gaps
The next Copilot review surfaced another batch of real issues, several of
which were stale carryovers from the pre-`dev167` head but some of which were
new and substantive:

- the initial batch-read change still left the old `test_main_reads_local_coordinator`
  double too brittle for an added relay request shape;
- `worktree-status-bundle` does **not** actually accept `--project`, so the
  relay caller's mapped-name argument would have kept every fetch cold;
- draining a previously-snapshotted ref list could poll a worktree after local
  ownership was gone, so explicit refs now revalidate against the current
  locally-owned set before fetching; and
- the relay store had no cleanup path, so a long-lived coordinator would have
  accumulated stale bundles indefinitely despite the cache being documented as
  transient.

Fixed all four: dropped the unsupported `--project` argument while still using
`identity.name_for_repo()` as the adoption gate, revalidated explicit refs
against current ownership, added a bounded relay-prune pass, and updated the
board/local-coordinator tests accordingly. Because those follow-ups again
changed plugin payload, bumped `agent-dispatch` to `0.1.2-dev168`. Targeted
validation re-ran green at **193 passed**.

### 2026-09-21 — Checked the Phase 0 preview screenshots; found and fixed a manifest drift
The operator asked to check the Phase 0 design-preview screenshots (captured
2026-09-17, kept in the operator's own local evidence-storage location,
outside this repo) for use as visual-regression and vision-alignment assets
going forward.

Reviewed all 10 images directly. Every layout/interaction rule they document
still holds against the current engine: the phase-colour palette, the
column-fit drop-with-"+N"-indicator at the narrow (118-col) width vs. all-
columns-shown at the wide (160-col) width, and every phase's task-menu
content (the `cli_openable` matrix — CLI-open excluded for Blocked/Started/
Queued-pooled, offered for Proposed/Suspended/Queued-unpooled — plus the
charter viewer and steer-modal reuse) all still match. No regression there.

Set up the two prerequisite venvs (`plugins/agent-worktrees/.venv`,
`worktree-manager/.venv`) plus the `picker-snapshot` npm package, and reran
`render_tasks_preview.py` today to get a fresh baseline against the *current*
engine rather than trusting five-day-old images. Diffing the two sets found:

1. **A real, fixable drift**: this preview's own
   `agent-dispatch.proposed.json` manifest had fallen out of sync with the
   real shipped `plugins/agent-dispatch/pivots/agent-dispatch.json` --
   missing the WT column's `"style": "bold cyan"` (the 2026-09-20 operator-
   feedback fix) and every column's `priority` field (silently relying on
   declaration order instead, which happens to agree with production's
   priorities today but isn't guaranteed to as either manifest evolves).
   Fixed by syncing both fields from the real manifest; reran the preview
   and confirmed the WT column now renders bold cyan, matching production.
   Verified with the full `production_picker` suite (**653 passed, 1
   skipped**) after the change.
2. **A known, out-of-scope gap, not fixed here**: several of this preview's
   own `actions` entries are still labelled "PROPOSED — not yet
   implemented" even though Phases 1-4 (and now 5/8) landed real
   implementations for several of them (pause, force-stop, reset-to-
   proposed, open-cli). Reconciling the preview's action descriptions with
   the real, now-implemented backend verbs is a distinct, larger pass (it
   touches every action's actual argv/semantics, not just two column
   fields) -- flagged as its own follow-up rather than attempted as a side
   effect of a screenshot check.
3. Cosmetic-only, not a regression: the fixture's machine/repo names
   changed between the two capture dates (from real-looking internal names
   to neutral placeholders) -- a positive identifier-neutrality improvement
   to the fixture data, unrelated to engine behavior.

**Going forward, this is the visual-regression workflow -- explicitly a
local-only, single-operator practice, not a repository-accessible or
CI-enforced one**: rerun `render_tasks_preview.py` and diff by eye against
the operator's own previously-saved reference set before merging any
change that touches `engine.py`'s render/column-fit path, `pivots.py`'s
manifest contract, or this pivot's own manifest. This repo's own
`tasks-preview/.gitignore` deliberately keeps generated PNGs out of git as
binary artifacts, and no shared/reproducible baseline location exists for
this tool today -- so no other contributor or CI can currently perform this
diff; only the operator running the tool locally can. Refreshed the
operator's own reference set with today's fresh, manifest-fixed capture,
superseding the 2026-09-17 one.

### 2026-09-22 — Phase 7 re-grounded: most items were already landed; open-cli was the real gap
Fresh worktree, fresh read of the effort, and a direct re-grounding against the
real shipped code rather than the stale checklist. The headline finding: **the
Phase 7 Plan text had drifted further than the implementation.**

- **Already landed before this session (confirmed in code, not assumed from the
  stale checklist):**
  - `worktree-status` was already a real card surface once Phase 8/5's relay
    work landed in PRs #3222/#3234.
  - Pause/Unpause/Force-stop/Reset-to-Proposed/Abandon were already wired to
    real CLI verbs in the pivot manifest (`agent-dispatch pause/unpause/force-
    stop/reset/abandon --help` matches the manifest argv shapes).
- **Not actually landed despite the earlier claim:** the `charter` card still is
  NOT live. `board_cli.py` still intentionally sets `has_charter = False`, so
  the card action remains hidden with no real `charter.*` payload. Updated the
  Phase 7 checklist to say this plainly instead of retroactively marking it done.
- **The one real remaining Phase 7 gap was `open-cli`.** The manifest still
  named the generic Worktrees `open-cli` internal verb while `board_cli.py`
  hard-coded `cli_openable = False`. That generic verb only opens an already-
  loaded worktree row; it cannot create a Proposed/Queued task's worktree and
  it bypasses the Suspended-task ownership rebind that
  `interactive_embody.launch_interactive_embodiment()` exists to perform.

**What landed in this session:**

1. **Dedicated picker verb:** `worktree-manager` now has a new internal
   `embody-cli` action. It shells out off-thread to `agent-dispatch embody
   --interactive --machine <task-machine>`, parses the returned JSON, and on
   success exits the picker into the resulting worktree's standard resume flow.
   Post-launch attachment deliberately reuses the same launch-decision plumbing
   as Worktrees `open-cli`: if the worktree row is already loaded, it reuses the
   real row; if the embody transaction just created the worktree and the picker
   has not reloaded yet, it synthesizes the minimal resume decision from the
   returned worktree id plus the row's machine/env so `worktree-manager
   __main__` can still launch it correctly.
2. **Failure behavior:** an `InteractiveEmbodimentError` now surfaces as the
   action's own stderr / nonzero exit message on the picker status line instead
   of escaping through internal-action dispatch. No crash path.
3. **Real `cli_openable` gate:** `board_cli.py` now computes `cli_openable`
   from the interactive-embodiment transaction's status contract: `proposed`
   (implicitly approved), `queued`, or `suspended`; never `claimed`, `started`,
   or terminal.
4. **Manifest/docs sync:** the real pivot manifest's `open-cli` action now
   points at `embody-cli` with an accurate description, the preview manifest was
   updated to match this one changed behavior, and the Phase 7 checklist/Runbook
   now distinguish "already landed earlier", "landed now", and "still open"
   instead of leaving everything marked undone.

**Validation (2026-09-22):**

- `worktree-manager`: targeted `test_picker_tui.py -k "embody_cli_internal_action or open_worktree_cli"` passed (4/4), then the full suite passed at **1088 passed / 1 skipped**.
- `agent-dispatch`: targeted `test_board_cli.py` passed (11/11), then the full
  plugin suite passed at **3325 passed / 13 skipped / 1 warning** using the
  package's own `.venv` + direct `pytest tests -q`. The repo-level
  `tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-dispatch` runner was also tried, but its
  contained 300s per-sub-suite wall clock budget expired mid-run despite the
  underlying tests continuing to pass; treated as a runner-budget limit, not a
  product failure, and the native full suite above was the authoritative check.

### 2026-09-25 — Phases 10-11 added: New Task composer + Completion Review card
The agent-dispatch parent and tasks-pane-ux vision (PR #3622, re-landed as
#3625 after a merge-target mistake) added two operator-facing concepts this
session: **The New Task composer** and **The Completion Review card**. Carved
those into this effort as Phase 10 and Phase 11 rather than opening a
redundant tasks-pane effort, since this one already owns exactly this scope
(Phases 0-9) and both new phases reuse machinery Phases 0/2/8 already built
(the `kind:"form"`/`kind:"card"` pivot mechanism, the shared artifacts
surface). Phase 11 has a real cross-effort dependency: it needs
`TaskQueue.confirm`/`reopen_completed`, which live in the new sibling effort
[`agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state`](../agent-dispatch-monitor-and-confirmed-state/README.md)
(not yet started) — noted inline on the phase so a resuming agent doesn't
try to build the card against an API that doesn't exist yet. Phase 10 has no
such dependency; it is pure `propose`+`queue` wiring and could start
independently.

### 2026-09-29 — Phase 7 closed out: charter card + the Paused phase/badge
Fresh worktree, ramped up via the effort's own Runbook/Plan/Journal (found
the Runbook itself had gone stale — it still read as of Phase 3 despite
Phases 4-8 having landed since; added a dated "read this bullet first"
summary at the top rather than rewriting the whole section). Picked Phase 7
as the smallest remaining scope that closes out a whole phase, per the
Runbook's own two open items:

1. **The `charter` card.** `board_cli.py` gained `_charter_for_task()`,
   composing a real `charter.*` payload from fields every `Task` already
   carries: structured metadata (repo, source, `origin_ref` as
   registrar/recipe, target machine, labels) plus the durable `goal`/
   `done_criteria` when recorded, plus the raw `prompt` verbatim in a fenced
   code block — deliberately giving the operator BOTH "what this task is"
   (a description) and its raw content (the exact prompt), the same duality
   the operator asked for when comparing this to the steering card. Every
   task now has a title + prompt at minimum, so `has_charter` is simply
   `True` for every row — no more hard-`False` gate.
2. **The Paused phase/badge.** `board_cli._group()` (and its byte-identical
   `task_query_cli._board_group()`, which the module's own comment already
   flagged as needing to stay in sync) now check `hold_reason` right after
   the terminal-status checks and before `awaiting_steer`: a held task
   always reads as `"Paused"`, winning over both system-`Suspended` (a
   liveness-detected or force-stopped outcome the system can recover from)
   and `Blocked` (the task itself asking the operator something) — never
   over a terminal status, since `set_hold` already refuses to hold a
   concluded task. Added `"Paused"` to `GROUPS`/`_BOARD_GROUPS` right after
   `Blocked`, and to `worktree-manager`'s shared `task_phase` palette
   (`engine_helpers.py`) as `C_STATE["ORPHAN"]` (magenta) — deliberately far
   from `Suspended`'s teal and `Blocked`'s amber so the three never read as
   the same thing at a glance. Also re-worded `SUSPENDED`'s own palette
   comment, which previously said "user/system paused" — no longer accurate
   now that "user paused" has its own distinct value.
   **One manifest follow-up required:** the `abandon` action's `when.group`
   list needed `"Paused"` added — force-abandon ("the user's way to say
   No") must still work on a paused task, and simply stopped matching once
   held tasks moved out of their old group. `reset-proposed`'s list needed
   NO change: `reset()` already `reject_if_held`s, so no longer matching
   `Paused` correctly hides an action that would otherwise fail rather than
   silently offering a doomed call.

**Design note not obvious from the diff:** whether a *Blocked+held* task
(rare — the UI only offers Pause on `embodied`/`started` tasks, but the
hold itself has no status restriction beyond non-terminal) should still
show its `steer` action was considered and deliberately left as-is: since
`Paused` now wins the group and `steer`'s `when` still keys off
`{"group": "Blocked"}`, a paused-while-blocked task's steer card becomes
temporarily inaccessible until unpaused. This reads as consistent with a
hold's whole purpose (stop everything until the operator explicitly
unpauses) rather than a bug, but is worth revisiting if it ever proves
reachable/confusing in practice.

**Validation (2026-09-29):**
- New tests: `test_cli.py::TestInboxBoard::test_hold_reason_is_paused_and_wins_over_blocked`,
  `test_board_cli.py::test_build_group_paused_for_held_task`,
  `test_board_cli.py::test_build_charter_is_always_populated`,
  `test_picker_tui.py::test_palette_style_task_phase_distinguishes_paused_from_suspended`.
- `agent-dispatch`: targeted `test_board_cli.py test_cli.py` — 194/194 passed.
  Full suite: **3559 passed / 1 pre-existing failed / 20 skipped** (the one
  failure, `test_supervisor.py::test_idle_headless_fleet_nudge_includes_
  remote_host`, was verified to fail identically against a clean `git
  stash`-restored baseline of this same worktree — pre-existing/
  environmental, not caused by this change).
- `worktree-manager`: targeted palette tests — 3/3 passed. Full suite:
  **1554 passed / 5 pre-existing failed / 5 skipped** — all 5 verified
  either to fail identically against the clean-stashed baseline
  (`test_registered_pivot_conditional_actions_filter_by_when`,
  `test_live_mapping_republished_on_a_backstop_cadence_without_a_restart`,
  both `test_trusted_materializer_parity` tests,
  `test_fetch_via_tarball_refuses_a_symlinked_extraction_top_dir`) or, for
  `test_steering_card_and_form_actions_gate_and_drive`, to pass cleanly in
  isolation (a load-sensitive flake, same class as the ones already logged
  in this Runbook).

**Phase 7 is now COMPLETE.** Next candidates per the Runbook's updated
2026-09-29 summary: Phase 10 (New Task composer, zero dependencies) or
Phase 11 (Completion Review card, unblocked since PR #3715).

### 2026-09-29 (later same day) — Phase 3 amendment: standardize the Tasks row on the shared two-line shape
Same session, continuing after the Phase 7 PR merged. New operator
feedback: the Tasks row should follow the SAME two-line convention
Worktrees/CodeSpaces/Containers already use —

```
<id##>  STATUS  stat1  stat2  stat3  ...  <claim1>, <claim2>, <claim3>...
  [tag] <optional-repo?> <succinct title explaining work> - <short phrase describing activity...>
```

— rather than the Tasks pane's current flat, single-line `columns` table
(id/PHASE/REPO/TITLE/WT/T/LIVE/ARTIFACTS all crammed into line 1).

**Investigation (read-only, before touching anything):** dispatched a
background `explore` agent to map exactly how Worktrees/CodeSpaces/
Containers get this shape today. Finding: it is **not** one shared
`detail_line`/multi-field manifest contract — `TasksView._column_subtitle()`
(`engine_views.py`) is a simple single-field lookup: whatever the manifest's
`entry.subtitle` names, rendered dim on an indented second line. CodeSpaces/
Containers already opt into exactly this (their own `subtitle` field is a
fully pre-composed string built in their own board/pool Python, e.g.
`agent_codespaces/pool.py`'s `_prefixed_subtitle`). Worktrees itself has a
bespoke (non-generic) `_detail_line()`, but its `[tag]` convention —
`derive.norm()`'s `_tag` (`"system"`/`"delegate"`/`"acp"`) prefixed onto the
title — is exactly the shape the operator's ASCII template's `[tag]` means:
**only the row's NON-default kind gets a bracketed mark**; the common case
stays untagged. No engine/manifest-schema change was needed at all — this
whole redesign is a `board_cli.py` (data) + manifest (drop two columns, wire
one field name) change, reusing machinery that already exists.

**What landed:**

1. **Line 1 (`columns`) now carries stats only:** `ID`, `PHASE`, `WT`,
   `LIVE`, `T`, trailing `ARTIFACTS` (the claims list — now also the FLEX
   column by virtue of being last/no `"title"` key present, which happens
   to suit it well: a claims list is naturally variable-length, the same
   role `TITLE` used to play). `TITLE` and `REPO` are gone from `columns`
   entirely.
2. **Line 2 (`entry.subtitle` -> a new `subtitle` field) carries
   `[tag] <repo> <title> - <phrase>`:** three new `board_cli.py` functions —
   `_embodiment_tag()`, `_activity_phrase()`, `_subtitle_for_task()` — compose
   it. `_embodiment_tag()` mirrors Worktrees' own convention: a confirmed
   headless liveness signal (`wt_live` non-`None`) is the DEFAULT embodiment
   for a Task -> no tag; an owned, live task with NO headless signal is
   assumed CLI-embodied (Phase 1/2's only other embodiment path) -> `"cli"`.
   **This is explicitly a heuristic, not a new authoritative
   `embodiment_kind` field** — it reuses the exact same ambiguity `wt_live`
   itself already documents (a blank/guessed value means "no headless
   signal available here", not a hard guarantee). A real `embodiment_kind`
   sourced from the coordinator's `local-body:`/`fleet-body:` spawn-
   reservation handle (see Phase 1 item 2's `_active_headless_handle`)
   remains the still-open, more-authoritative follow-on if the operator
   wants the tag to stop being a guess — tracked here, not built today.
   `_activity_phrase()` prefers a real `wt_live` signal, else falls back in
   priority order: hold reason (truncated to 40 chars) -> awaiting-steer ->
   raw lifecycle status (`"queued"`/`"queued for a worker"` when pooled/
   `"awaiting approval"`/`"claimed, starting…"`/`"in progress"`/terminal
   labels).
3. **Manifest:** `entry.subtitle` renamed from `"repo_name"` to the new
   `"subtitle"` field (matching the field NAME CodeSpaces/Containers already
   use for the same mechanism — a naming convention, not a functional
   requirement). `title`/`repo_name` columns removed; remaining column
   `priority`s renumbered contiguously (1-5); `artifacts_summary` dropped
   its now-meaningless declared `priority` (it's the flex column, never
   dropped, so a declared priority number was dead weight).

**What did NOT change:** `entry.title` stays `"title"` (still needed for
`{title}` action templating, e.g. the `kick` action, and for the non-
`columns` fallback render path) — removing a field from `columns` (display)
never touches `entry.title`/`entry.id` (identity/templating), a distinct,
unrelated manifest concern confirmed by direct code reading before editing.
No `worktree-manager` engine code changed at all; `_column_subtitle` already
did exactly what was needed.

**Validation (2026-09-29):** New tests in `test_board_cli.py`
(`test_activity_phrase_prioritizes_wt_live_then_hold_then_lifecycle`,
`test_embodiment_tag_only_marks_the_non_default_cli_interface`,
`test_subtitle_for_task_assembles_tag_repo_title_and_phrase`,
`test_build_populates_subtitle_and_drops_title_repo_from_columns`).
`agent-dispatch` full suite: **3563 passed / 1 pre-existing failed / 20
skipped** (same lone flake as the prior entry, `test_supervisor.py::
test_idle_headless_fleet_nudge_includes_remote_host`). `worktree-manager`
full suite: **1541 passed / 4 pre-existing failed / 5 skipped** — note the
total is naturally lower than the prior entry's 1554/1564 because this
session's `git sync` (see below) pulled in 3 new `origin/dev` commits with
their own test churn, not a regression; `--collect-only` confirmed 1550
tests collected, matching 1541+4+5 exactly. All 4 failures are the SAME
pre-existing/environmental ones already logged in the prior Journal entry
(2 of the previous run's 5 — the `test_registered_pivot_conditional_
actions_filter_by_when` load-sensitive flake and the `test_steering_card_
and_form_actions_gate_and_drive` flake — simply didn't reproduce this run,
consistent with them being flakes, not fixed regressions).

**Side quest, unrelated to this change but blocking `create-pr` on this
worktree:** `check-vendored-libs-sync` failed with `agent-procutil`
"COPIES OUT OF SYNC" between `plugins/agent-dispatch/libs/agent-procutil`,
`worktree-manager/libs/agent-procutil`, and `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/
agent-procutil`. Root-caused (not a real repo defect): both non-
agent-worktrees consumers already use the `--uv-editable` reference form
(no real committed copy at all -- `git ls-files` confirmed zero tracked
files under either path); this session's own `uv pip install -e`/`uv sync`
calls materialized a real LOCAL editable-install cache (`build/`, `*.egg-
info`) at those exact paths, which `sync-vendored-libs.py --check` then
mistook for a genuine (empty, missing `__init__.py`) vendored copy and
flagged as drifted against `agent-worktrees`' real one. Deleting those
local-only leftover directories (they contained nothing but stale build
artifacts) made the check pass again -- this will reproduce for ANY
contributor who runs this effort's own documented build/test commands in a
fresh worktree before opening a PR; worth a `.gitignore` follow-up in
`tools/sync-vendored-libs.py`'s own repo if it recurs, but out of scope for
this effort.

### 2026-09-30 — LENGTH column: a real cross-plugin fix for the previously-blank T column
Operator asked directly: "Do tasks have a turn counter or is that pulled
from the assigned worktree?" Investigated before answering -- grepped the
whole `agent_dispatch` package for `turn_count` and found it nowhere except
the manifest's own column declaration. The `T` column had been silently
blank since Phase 3 landed; nothing had ever wired it. Reported this
honestly rather than assuming either answer.

**Operator's follow-up:** pull it from the assigned worktree, using the SAME
`"Ns Nt"` format as the (separate) `worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul` effort's own
planned `LENGTH` column rename (its 2026-09-29 Journal entry: rename
Worktrees' `SESS/T` column, reformat from `"1/25"` to `"1s 25t"`). Before
implementing, investigated whether this was actually available: the
cross-repo relay bundle `board_cli.py` already consumes (`git_state`/
`liveness`/`lineage`/`claims`/`disposition`, via `agent_worktrees
.worktree_status_compute.compute()`) had NO fact carrying session/turn
counts -- those live only in `agent-worktrees`' own LOCAL `WorktreeRecord
.session_turns`/`.sessions`, never relayed cross-machine. This is a genuine
cross-plugin gap, not a quick Tasks-side fix. **Checked in with the
operator before expanding scope into a different plugin's relay contract**
(three options offered: add the relay fact now, stub the column blank
pending a separate change, or use a different proxy signal) -- operator
chose to add the relay fact now.

**What landed (spans `agent-worktrees` + `agent-dispatch`, same PR):**

1. **`agent-worktrees`**: `worktree_status_compute.compute()` gained a new
   `session_length` fact -- `{"session_count": len(record.sessions or ()),
   "turn_count": record.session_turns}` -- inserted right after the
   existing `lineage` fact. Deliberately always `confirmed: True` (unlike
   git_state/liveness's degraded-on-failure path): both values are durable,
   already-cached `WorktreeRecord` fields (the exact same ones the LOCAL
   Picker's own `session_count`/`turn_count` computation in `__main__.py`
   already reads), not a fresh probe -- there is no transient-failure case
   to degrade from. Verified the whole pipeline needs NO other
   agent-worktrees code change: `cmd_worktree_status_bundle` (the
   `worktree-status-bundle --json` CLI command `agent-dispatch`'s
   coordinator loop shells out to) just serializes whatever `compute()`
   returns, so the new fact flows through automatically. Updated its
   docstring/help text for discoverability and the fact-assembly test's
   `set(bundle["facts"])` assertion (renamed "all five facts" -> "all six").
2. **`agent-dispatch`**: new `worktree_status_relay._length_display()`
   renders `"<session_count>s <turn_count>t"` from the fact -- `None`
   (blank cell, never a fabricated `"0s 0t"`) when the relay is stale, the
   fact is missing/unconfirmed, or `turn_count` is `None` (a never-resumed
   worktree). Wired into `board_fields_for_task()`'s return dict as
   `length_display` (including the no-claiming-worktree early-return
   branch) and into the `worktree_status` card's own body via a new
   `_fact_body("Session length", ...)` line, so the drill-in card shows it
   too, not just the column. Manifest: `turn_count`/`T` ->
   `length_display`/`LENGTH`, width 4 -> 9 to fit `"12s 340t"`-scale values.
3. **No `board_cli.py` changes needed** beyond the manifest key rename --
   `row.update(board_fields_for_task(...))` already runs unconditionally
   per row and merges whatever keys that function returns.

**Validation (2026-09-30):** New tests:
`test_worktree_status_compute.py::test_assembles_all_six_facts_for_a_real_
record` (renamed + extended), `test_board_cli.py::test_length_display_
formats_and_degrades_gracefully` (direct unit test), `test_build_length_
display_blank_when_no_worktree_or_stale`, plus a `length_display`
assertion added to the existing fresh-relay test. `agent-worktrees` full
suite: **6054 passed / 3 pre-existing failed / 42 skipped** -- 2 of the 3
(`test_profile_assignment.py::test_concurrent_allocation_serializes_bag_
positions`, `test_tracking.py::TestRecordLockCrossProcess::test_no_lost_
updates_across_processes`) were a `__pycache__` file-lock contention
artifact from running three full suites in parallel on this machine at
once (confirmed: both passed cleanly in isolation); the third
(`test_mux_status_link.py::test_push_status_via_daemon_reports_daemon_
unavailable_when_missing`) is a genuine pre-existing failure, confirmed via
a clean `git stash` of this worktree, entirely unrelated to
`worktree_status_compute.py`. `agent-dispatch` full suite: **3568 passed /
1 pre-existing failed / 20 skipped** (the same `test_supervisor.py::
test_idle_headless_fleet_nudge_includes_remote_host` flake logged in the
prior entry). `worktree-manager` full suite (unaffected by this change, run
for completeness since it shares the Tasks pivot's render path): **1484
passed / 4 pre-existing failed / 1 skipped** -- the same 4 failures logged
in the prior entry.

### 2026-09-30 (later same day) — Phase 10 status check surfaces a real prerequisite gap; spun into a sibling effort
Operator asked to check on Phase 10's "New task…" button. Confirmed via a
fresh `git log`/grep against `origin/dev` that it remains entirely
unimplemented (Phase 10's checklist still all `[ ]`). Investigated WHY
before just reporting "not started," per this effort's own established
practice of grounding status claims in real code rather than trusting a
Plan's own prose.

That investigation found Phase 10's own Plan text carries a wrong
assumption: it says the "New task…" action should mirror Worktrees' own
"+ New worktree…" button using the "SAME declarative composer machinery
already proven for steering" -- but `pivot_manifest.py`'s `PivotAction`/
`kind:"form"` mechanism is **row-scoped by design** (every field spec is
resolved against an already-selected entry via `_pivots.resolve_path(rec,
...)`), and "+ New worktree…" itself turns out to be entirely hand-coded
Worktrees-specific UI chrome (`engine_selection.py`'s `new_worktree_row` +
the `"N"` button-zone case), not a generic, manifest-driven mechanism any
registered pivot can opt into. This is a genuine, previously-undocumented
prerequisite this phase cannot skip.

In the same conversation, the operator independently raised a second,
related want -- an optional Prompt field on Worktrees' "New worktree…"
dialog itself, so a freshly created session can launch `--interactive`
with a seed prompt already queued ("fire and forget", skipping the wait
through the lengthy auto-update/bootstrap flow). Rather than solve either
piecemeal, spun up a new sibling effort,
[`picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer`](../picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer/README.md),
covering both (they share the same missing capability: a field-spec-driven
form opened with no row selected, plus reusable field-rendering code
extracted from the existing, steer-coupled `PivotFormScreen`). That
effort's own Journal records a full five-layer investigation of the
New-worktree activation-to-launch path, including a genuinely useful find:
a seed-prompt mechanism (`--seed`/`--seed-ready-timeout`) already exists on
`agent-worktrees copilot`, just unreachable from the Picker's actual
creation flow today.

Phase 10's own section here now explicitly depends on that sibling
effort's Phase B. No code changed in this effort this session; the
Runbook's new top bullet + this Journal entry + the cross-link in Phase
10's section are this session's full contribution. Next real Tasks-pane
work should wait for the sibling effort's Phase B (or, if the operator
wants continued forward motion on this effort specifically in the
meantime, Phase 6/9/11 remain independent and unblocked).
