# Phase 10 - Wire the declared state machines into the live runtime

Linked from the effort [`README.md`](README.md) Plan. Read this only when
working this phase.

## Why this phase exists

Phase 9 deliberately declared four machines --
[`task_state_machine.py`](../../../plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/task_state_machine.py),
[`provider_state_machine.py`](../../../plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/provider_state_machine.py),
[`bridge_state_machine.py`](../../../plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/bridge_state_machine.py),
[`spawn_reservation_machine.py`](../../../plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/spawn_reservation_machine.py)
-- plus their coupling
([`machine_coupling.py`](../../../plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/machine_coupling.py))
as pure data and pure functions, proven internally sound by deterministic,
in-process structural and simulation tests. That was the correct first
step (a design must be checkable before it governs anything), but it left
a real gap: **none of it changes what `queue.py`'s actual runtime code
does.** The declared tables and the executing code are today two
independently-maintained things that happen to agree, verified only by
tests that assert they still match (e.g.
`test_all_states_match_queue_status`). A future edit to a legal
transition in `queue.py` could silently drift from the declared table
without any test catching it until the structural-consistency test is
updated by hand to match -- exactly the kind of parallel-truth gap this
effort exists to close everywhere else.

This phase makes the declared tables **the single source of truth the
live code executes against**, one machine and one call site at a time,
never behavior-changing by design (the declared tables already match
today's real transitions -- that is precisely why wiring them in is safe)
except where wiring surfaces a genuine, previously-undetected discrepancy,
which becomes its own tracked fix rather than silently absorbed into a
wiring slice.

**Scope boundary:** this phase wires code to already-declared tables. It
does not redesign any machine's shape (that was Phase 9's job) and it
does not fold in the five still-conceptual Phase 8 candidates (a separate,
independent follow-up). If wiring a machine surfaces a case the declared
table does not cover, that gap is fixed in the declared table first (as
its own small design correction, following Phase 9's own conventions), not
patched directly in `queue.py`.

## Wiring order and rationale

Each of the four machines is wired independently, in the order that
minimizes risk and unblocks the most Validation Plan items fastest:

1. **Task machine into `queue.py`'s own transition call sites.** Every
   public method that calls `TaskQueue._transition(...)` today passes an
   inline, hardcoded `allowed=`/`to=` pair (e.g. `approve` hardcodes
   `allowed={Status.PROPOSED}, to=Status.QUEUED`). Confirmed by direct
   reading: every one of these hardcoded pairs already matches
   `task_state_machine.TRANSITIONS` exactly (`approve`, `start`,
   `suspend`, `resume`, `release_suspended`, `complete`, `abandon`, plus
   the `Status.HELD`-sourced `requeue_held`/`dead_letter_held` transitions
   used by liveness GC). Wiring replaces each hardcoded pair with a lookup
   against `task_state_machine.TRANSITIONS_BY_NAME[name]`, so the declared
   table becomes the actual governing data, not a parallel description of
   it. Lowest risk (behavior-preserving by construction) and unblocks the
   restart-at-any-boundary and duplicate-delivery Validation Plan items,
   which are fundamentally about the task machine's own transitions.
   **Correction found while wiring:** `TaskQueue.yield_task` (a worker's
   own deliberate, voluntary give-back on a recoverable snag -- distinct
   from `requeue_held`'s automatic owner-gone reconciliation, though both
   move `HELD -> QUEUED`) was entirely missing from the original
   declaration. Added as its own named transition rather than folded into
   `requeue_held`, since it has a different actor and a different
   recovery mode (`SAFE_RETRY`, not `SELF_REPAIR`).
2. **`machine_coupling.apply_transition`'s CAS primitive into `queue.py`'s
   concurrency fencing.** **Correction (found during slice 1's direct
   reading of `_transition`, which the original design here got wrong):**
   `queue.py` does **not** implement a `WHERE generation = ?`-conditioned
   `UPDATE` in the general path -- `_transition`'s SQL is
   `UPDATE tasks SET ... WHERE id = ?`, with no generation clause. Its
   real concurrency mechanism is `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (SQLite's write-lock-
   now transaction mode), which serializes every `_transition` call
   against a given database, plus a fresh Python-level
   `task.status not in allowed_set` check read *inside* that lock. This
   is pessimistic locking, not optimistic CAS -- a different mechanism
   than `machine_coupling`'s declared generation-conditioned `UPDATE`
   primitive, though it achieves the same no-lost-updates guarantee by a
   different route. A `WHERE generation = ?` clause only appears when a
   caller explicitly supplies `expected_generation`, and a mismatch there
   raises `TaskError` immediately rather than resolving to
   `CASOutcome.LOST_CAS`/`ALREADY_ADVANCED` the way
   `machine_coupling.apply_transition` does.

   This means wiring item 2 is **not** a low-risk parity confirmation the
   way item 1 was -- it is a genuine design question that must be
   answered before any code changes: **does a replayed request against an
   already-advanced task (e.g. a duplicate `approve` call after the first
   one already succeeded) currently raise `TaskError`, and should that
   change to a silent no-op** (matching `machine_coupling`'s
   `ALREADY_ADVANCED` semantics and this effort's "duplicate delivery
   produces... at most one submission" Validation Plan item)? Today's
   answer, confirmed by reading every `_transition` call site: **yes, it
   raises** for every method except `suspend` (which has its own
   hand-written early-return for the specific same-owner-already-
   suspended case) and `complete_with_outcome` (which has its own
   hand-written idempotent-replay path for a result already recorded).
   No existing test locks in "raise" as required behavior for the other
   five methods, but changing it is an observable behavior change for any
   caller currently catching `TaskError` to detect "someone already did
   this" -- **this must not be decided unilaterally inside a wiring
   slice**. Before implementing, get explicit confirmation on which of
   these is wanted:
   - (a) Leave every method's raise-on-already-advanced behavior exactly
     as it is today, and only make the classification *observable*
     (e.g. a distinguishable audit-log note or exception subtype) without
     changing what callers experience, or
   - (b) Extend `suspend`'s and `complete_with_outcome`'s existing
     idempotent-replay pattern to the other five methods, making
     duplicate delivery a true no-op everywhere, which is a real behavior
     change validated by new tests, not merely "wiring."
   Whichever is chosen, the shared `machine_coupling.apply_transition`
   primitive is still the right vocabulary to express the outcome in
   -- this correction only changes what work item 2 actually requires
   before code is written, not the direction.
3. **Provider machine into a real provider adapter (or adapters).**
   Unlike the task machine, there is today **no existing provider-adapter
   code in this plugin** to wire against -- `provider_state_machine.py`'s
   capability table and revision/approval dimensions have no live GitHub/
   ADO/Gitea driver reading real PR state yet. This slice is additive, not
   a refactor: build the first adapter (GitHub, since this repo's own
   dogfooding runs there) that observes real PR state and drives it
   through the declared `ApprovalStatus`/`Mergeability`/`Revision`
   transitions rather than ad hoc polling logic. Higher-risk and larger
   than (1)/(2) -- expect this to be several slices, not one.
4. **Bridge machine into agent-bridge's live session/liveness reads.**
   `bridge_state_machine.py`'s hot/warm/cold liveness model and resume
   semantics need a live `live_probe` implementation reading real
   agent-bridge session state. **Correction (this item does not depend on
   agent-bridge-ahp-convergence):** an earlier note here conflated this
   with the agent-bridge-ahp-convergence effort (an unrelated concern --
   exposing an *external* Agent Host Protocol surface). The actual live
   read this item needs already exists and is already in production use --
   `embody.local_body_verdict`/`fleet_body_verdict` (`agent-bridge --json
   status <session>`), the same read item 5's spawn-consistency sweep
   already calls.
5. **Spawn-reservation machine into `queue.py`'s real `SpawnReservation`
   lifecycle.** Same shape as (1): `spawn_reservation_machine.py`'s
   transition table is already sourced from the real
   `agent_dispatch.queue.SpawnState`, and its `implemented_by` fields
   already name the real methods (`record_spawn`, `record_cold`,
   `request_spawn_release`, `fail_spawn`, `defer_spawn`, `settle_spawn`,
   `retire_spawn`, `rearm_spawn`). Wiring here means confirming
   `violating_assignment_groups` and `classify_consistency` are actually
   *called* somewhere in the supervisor's real reconciliation loop (e.g.
   a periodic consistency sweep that logs/alerts on any classified
   anomaly), not just proven sound as declared functions nobody invokes.

Items 1, 2, and 5 are refactors/additions against **existing, real,
already-working code** -- they are the safe, tractable first slices.
Item 3 requires building genuinely new adapter code and item 4 depends on
agent-bridge's own convergence; both are larger, later slices, planned
here but not blocking the start of 1/2/5.

## Plan (this phase)

- [x] Wire the task machine into `queue.py`'s `_transition` call sites
  (item 1 above): replaced each hardcoded `allowed=`/`to=` pair (`approve`,
  `start`, `suspend`, `resume`, `release_suspended`, `abandon`, and
  `complete_with_outcome`'s local `allowed` set) with a lookup against a
  new `task_state_machine.TRANSITIONS_BY_NAME`, via a lazily-imported
  `_task_transition_spec()` helper in `queue.py` (a lazy import avoids the
  circular-import risk, since `task_state_machine` itself imports `Status`
  from `queue`). Wiring surfaced one real, previously-undetected
  discrepancy: the declared `complete` transition only named `started`,
  but `complete_with_outcome` has always also allowed completing a
  `suspended` task directly (a suspended task may resolve while no worker
  process is running). Corrected the declared table to match the real,
  already-working behavior, per this phase's own scope boundary ("the
  gap is fixed in the declared table first... not patched directly in
  `queue.py`"). Added
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/tests/test_task_transition_wiring.py` (9 tests)
  proving each call site genuinely *reads* the declared table --
  monkeypatching a transition's `from_states`/`to_state` and asserting the
  live method's behavior changes to match, not just that today's literals
  happen to agree with it.
- [x] **Resolved: option (b), scoped narrowly.** Operator confirmed (b):
  extend the `suspend`/`complete_with_outcome` idempotent-replay pattern
  to the other five methods, but only under a narrow safety condition --
  a no-op fires **only** when the task is already sitting in the exact
  target state (`task.status == to`) **and** the existing owner/
  generation/session fences still match; anything else (wrong owner,
  wrong state entirely, a fenced generation mismatch) still raises
  exactly as before. Implemented as an opt-in `idempotent_replay: bool`
  parameter on `_transition` (default `False`, so untouched call sites
  are unaffected), enabled for `approve`, `start`,
  `release_suspended`, `abandon`, `yield_task` unconditionally, and for
  `resume` only when `adopt_owner_session_id is None` (a handoff-
  adoption resume must always bump the generation and adopt the new
  session -- a no-op there would silently drop that real effect, so
  it deliberately still raises on a bare replay). Backed by
  `test_transition_idempotent_replay.py` (10 tests): a replay is a no-op
  for every enabled method, a wrong-owner or wrong-state replay still
  raises, and the adoption-resume path never no-ops even on an
  otherwise-matching replay.
- [x] Build the first live provider adapter (GitHub) driving
  `provider_state_machine`'s declared dimensions from real PR state (item
  3 above). Expect this to be split into its own sequence of slices as
  scope becomes clearer once adapter work starts. **First slice landed:**
  a read-only observer, `github_provider_adapter.py`. `observe_pr_state`
  is a pure function classifying a raw GitHub GraphQL `pullRequest` node
  into `ApprovalStatus`/`Mergeability`/`HoldReason` (via `reviewDecision`,
  `mergeable` + `statusCheckRollup`, `isDraft`/title-or-label WIP markers/
  unresolved review threads) plus the raw `Revision` fingerprints
  (`headRefOid`/`baseRefOid`). `GitHubPRAdapter` is the thin `gh`-CLI
  fetch wrapper (mirrors `repository_issue_loops.GitHubProvider`'s
  injectable-runner + identity-verification pattern). Deliberately does
  **not** decide `ApprovalStatus.STALE` (that needs a previously-recorded
  `Revision` an evaluator holds, not a single snapshot), write anything
  back to GitHub, or feed any task/coordinator loop -- a read model only,
  same "declare/observe first, wire later" sequencing Phase 9 used for
  the declared tables themselves. An unrecognized `reviewDecision`/
  `mergeable`/`statusCheckRollup.state` value raises rather than guesses.
  **Second slice landed:** `pr_polling_policy.py`, the trigger/cadence
  policy for the "real polling/webhook-driven loop" the first slice left
  open. Operator resolution: webhooks are the primary, low-latency
  trigger; polling is only a fallback that fires once a PR's last
  observed state (from *any* source) is older than a declared,
  repository-tier-scoped interval -- `RepoTier.OWNED_PRIVATE` (5 min),
  `QUICK_COLLAB` (30 min), `PUBLIC_UNOWNED` (60 min, and the default for
  any undeclared repository -- the conservative choice to avoid tripping
  a shared rate limit on a repo this identity does not control). The
  repository -> tier mapping is caller-supplied config, not committed to
  this public, organization-neutral repo (no specific repository name
  belongs in plugin source here) -- same pattern
  `provider_state_machine.REPOSITORY_OVERRIDES` already uses. `poll_due`
  is the pure decision function; a fresh observation (webhook or poll)
  simply pushes the next poll out, so polling never fires while webhooks
  keep flowing.
  Remaining slices for item 3: an evaluator that holds prior `Revision`
  state and actually drives `APPROVAL_TRANSITIONS` (incl. `STALE`), a real
  webhook receiver for review/check-status events (the existing
  `producers/webhook.py` only handles PR-merge events), and the
  persistent per-(repo, PR) state store both the evaluator and the
  poll-fallback timer need.
  **Third slice landed:** `pr_revision_evaluator.py`, the `STALE`
  decision. `evaluate_observation(previous, current)` reuses the declared
  `APPROVAL_TRANSITIONS` table directly (looks up
  `revision_invalidates_approval` by name and checks `current`'s status
  against its `from_states`) rather than re-deciding the staleness rule
  inline -- same "the declared table is the actual governing data"
  discipline items 1/2 established. A first-ever observation (no
  `previous`) is returned unchanged: staleness needs two observations, not
  one. Never applies `revalidate_stale` itself -- that recovery is simply
  whatever the provider's own `reviewDecision` reports on the next
  observation, since this evaluator always recomputes from the provider's
  current raw status rather than a locally cached flag.
  **Fourth slice landed:** `pr_observation_store.py` -- the persistent
  per-(repo, PR) state the evaluator and the poll-fallback timer both need
  to hold `previous`/`last_observed_at` across calls. Deliberately **not**
  a new `queue.py` table: this repo now enforces a 1,000-line module-size
  cap (`tools/check-module-size.py`), and `queue.py` is already
  grandfathered at its current size -- growing it for an unrelated concern
  (no owner/generation/claim semantics in common with task/spawn-
  reservation/routing-assignment rows) is exactly the unbounded-growth
  failure that guard exists to catch. Its own small SQLite file instead, a
  self-contained `PRObservationStore` (get/put/last_observed_at, a plain
  upsert -- no CAS/generation fencing, since exactly one writer touches a
  given PR in every deployment this targets today). `record_observation()`
  is the actual glue: reads the stored previous observation, evaluates via
  `pr_revision_evaluator.evaluate_observation`, persists the result and the
  observation timestamp, and returns it -- the one call site a future
  polling/webhook loop needs.
  **Fifth slice landed (item 3 complete):**
  `pr_review_poll_loop.run_poll_cycle` -- the poll-fallback tick: iterates
  every `(repo, number)` the store already tracks
  (`PRObservationStore.tracked_keys()`, added this slice), refreshes
  whichever are due per `pr_polling_policy.poll_due`, and persists via
  `record_observation`. Never discovers new PRs itself -- a PR starts being
  tracked the moment anything records its first observation.
  `producers/github_pr_review_webhook.py` -- the reactive trigger: a
  GitHub-specific FastAPI receiver (`extract_pr_ref`) for
  `pull_request`/`pull_request_review`/`pull_request_review_thread`/
  `check_suite`/`check_run` events, HMAC-signature-verified
  (`X-Hub-Signature-256`, GitHub's own webhook-authenticity mechanism --
  distinct from the forge-neutral `producers/webhook.py`'s bearer-token
  `inbound_token`, since GitHub itself never sends a bearer token). A
  webhook delivery is used only as a **trigger**: the fields
  `observe_pr_state` needs (`reviewDecision` above all) are GraphQL-only
  aggregates the REST webhook payload does not carry, so the receiver
  re-fetches full state through the injected `observe` callable rather than
  trying to reconstruct it from the webhook body -- which also makes a
  late/duplicate/out-of-order delivery harmless (each just triggers a
  fresh, idempotent re-observation).
  Item 3's full pipeline is now built end-to-end: observe -> evaluate
  (staleness) -> persist -> triggered by webhook, backstopped by cadence-
  scoped polling. Not yet done: actually deploying/registering this
  webhook receiver and scheduling the poll-cycle tick against a real
  repository -- left to whoever operates a concrete deployment, since that
  requires real webhook-secret provisioning and a real schedule, both
  deployment-specific.
- [ ] Wire the bridge machine's `resolve_liveness`/`resolve_resume` against
  a real agent-bridge liveness read (item 4 above). **Not blocked on AHP
  convergence** (corrected above -- unrelated). **First slice landed:**
  `bridge_liveness_probe.py`, a real `local_body_liveness_probe(session_id)`
  reading `agent-bridge --json status <session_id>` directly (this
  machine's own daemon, no SSH) and mapping agent-bridge's own
  `SessionStatus` values to `Liveness`: `running` -> HOT (a turn is
  actively executing -- attaching a second controller now would race it),
  `idle`/`created`/`starting` -> WARM (alive, no turn in flight, safe to
  reattach), `stopping`/`stopped`/`failed`/`ended` -> COLD. Any not-found/
  transport-failure/unparseable/unrecognized read resolves to HOT, never
  guessed as WARM or COLD -- the deliberately conservative default: a
  refused resume (HOT's outcome absent `force_takeover`) is always safe,
  where wrongly resolving WARM or COLD risks a double-attached controller
  or an orphaned duplicate spawn. Never raises.
  Deliberately does **not** wire this probe into a real
  `resume`/reconciliation call site yet: every plausible call site
  (`supervisor.py`, `embody.py`) is already at its grandfathered
  module-size ceiling (`tools/module-size-baseline.json`) -- adding a call
  there means either splitting one of those modules first or a deliberate,
  reviewed widening, a decision this slice does not make unilaterally.
  A fleet (SSH) variant, following the same status-value mapping against
  `fleet_body_verdict`'s underlying probe, is left for a follow-up slice --
  also not blocked on anything.
  **Second slice landed:** operator chose splitting over widening.
  Extracted `embody.py`'s two large, pure autopilot seed-prompt builders
  (`autopilot_worker_prompt`/`fleet_autopilot_worker_prompt`, ~250 lines)
  into a new `embody_prompts.py` -- the safest possible cut (no shared
  state, no I/O, nothing any test mocks). `embody.py` re-exports both
  names, so every existing call site and test is unaffected; `embody.py`
  is now 989 lines, **graduated off the baseline entirely** (not merely
  re-grandfathered at a smaller size). This reopens headroom in `embody.py`
  for the actual call-site wiring, a further slice. `supervisor.py`
  (4,169 lines) remains a separate, much larger componentization target,
  not attempted here.
- [x] Call `spawn_reservation_machine.violating_assignment_groups` and
  `classify_consistency` from the supervisor's real reconciliation loop
  (item 5 above), with a live-behavior test proving an actual anomaly
  (e.g. a `SPAWNED` reservation whose live bridge read is `ABSENT`) is
  detected and surfaced, not just classifiable in the abstract. Added
  `Supervisor.sweep_spawn_consistency()`: a read-only, additive method
  (never mutates a reservation or task) that gathers real `ACTIVE`
  reservation rows, resolves liveness for each carrying a local body
  handle via the same `local_body_verdict_fn` the rest of this module
  already uses, translates the coarse live/gone/unknown verdict to a
  `BridgeState` via a new `spawn_reservation_machine.verdict_to_bridge_state`
  (unknown maps to `None`/not-applicable rather than guessing), and logs
  any detected anomaly or single-assignment violation. Scheduling this
  sweep on a periodic cadence is left as a follow-up decision; the method
  itself is safe to call at any time. Backed by
  `test_spawn_consistency_sweep.py` (6 tests): a consistent live
  reservation reports zero anomalies; a `SPAWNED` reservation whose
  liveness read is `gone` is detected; a non-local-body or `unknown`-
  verdict reservation is skipped rather than misclassified; the sweep
  never mutates the reservation it classifies; and a simulated
  single-assignment violation (constructed directly, since
  `reserve_spawn`'s own atomic guarantee makes this unreachable through
  normal usage) is caught.
- [ ] Revisit this effort's Validation Plan once each of the above lands
  and check off whichever items each wiring slice actually makes
  checkable against live behavior.
