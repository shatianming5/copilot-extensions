# CI Reliability & Flakiness Telemetry

- **Slug:** `ci-flakiness-telemetry-and-reliability`
- **Repo:** ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** per-slice PRs against `dev`
- **Created:** 2026-09-27
- **Status:** Active
  <!-- Phases 0/1/2 Done (reconciliation, telemetry pipeline, ranked
  report); Phase 3 (fix the top offenders) in progress -->
- **Umbrella issue:** _pending — file once this effort's plan is reviewed and merged_
- **Sub-issues:** the downstream tracker (flaky `test_first_use_provision_is_serialized`, filed on Gitea per facility convention, tracked here as the first known concrete item)

## Guiding Intent

`dev`'s CI should be trustworthy: a red run should mean a real regression, not
noise. This session found and fixed two genuine regressions that had gone
unnoticed because they merged despite red PR-time checks (#4239, #4242), plus
governance gaps that let that happen (now closed: CODEOWNERS + review-gate
rulesets). Separately, this session hit the *same* flaky test
(`test_first_use_provision_is_serialized`) fail independently on two
completely unrelated PRs, and observed an `identifier leak guard` check that
is red on every single PR, unconditionally (missing
`FORBIDDEN_IDS_FACILITY`/`FORBIDDEN_IDS_WORK` repo secrets — a config gap, not
a code defect). Both are exactly the kind of standing noise that erodes trust
in "red means something's actually wrong" and that this effort exists to find
and eliminate systematically, rather than one flake at a time as they happen
to be noticed.

## Participants

Solo effort — driven directly against `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions` via
per-slice worktrees + PRs, no multi-agent coordination required at this
scope.

## Context

- This session's own investigation (2026-09-27) root-caused a multi-hour `dev`
  CI stall to two independent test regressions (#4239 agent-logger,
  #4242 copilot-extensions-harness), found and closed a governance gap that
  let both merge despite red PR-time checks (CODEOWNERS root scope + a new
  "dev branch policy: review required (maintainer bypass)" ruleset, `PR gate`
  aggregate required-check job), and along the way hit
  `libs/payload-invocation/tests/test_generate.py::test_first_use_provision_is_serialized`
  fail independently twice, unrelated to either PR's own diff — filed as
  the downstream tracker.
- Also observed, every single time this session checked `pr checks` on any
  PR: an `identifier leak guard` check that is **always red**, because
  `FORBIDDEN_IDS_FACILITY`/`FORBIDDEN_IDS_WORK` repository secrets are not
  configured (the check itself reports this plainly: "the trusted scan cannot
  enforce the identifier denylist yet"). It is not a required check today, so
  it doesn't block merges, but it is pure, permanent noise on every PR's
  check list. **Already fully tracked**: `efforts/active/ci-identifier-leak-guard/`
  (#3923) owns this secret setup end-to-end — this effort only needs to
  confirm the telemetry stops flagging it once that effort lands, not
  re-plan the fix.
- No existing effort covers this specifically. `promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent`
  / the `ci-failure-remediation` vision cover *reacting to one red run at a
  time* (detection, dedup, a bounded fix-attempt agent) — this effort is
  complementary but distinct: it mines **historical run data** to find
  *recurring, high-impact* noise systematically, rather than reacting to
  whichever run happens to be red right now. Check for overlap/handoff points
  with that effort before duplicating any detection/dedup machinery it
  already has.
- GitHub Actions REST API surfaces used successfully this session for
  ad-hoc investigation (a starting point for the telemetry pipeline, not
  a final design):
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs?event=push&branch=dev` — per-branch
    run history with `conclusion` (`success`/`failure`/`cancelled`/...).
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}` — single run detail.
  - `gh run view <id> --job <job_id> --log-failed` — per-job failure logs
    (used manually this session; would need a scriptable equivalent, e.g.
    the same REST log-download endpoint, for automated parsing).
  - A **same-commit rerun that then succeeds** (observed directly this
    session, multiple times) is a strong, cheap flakiness signal worth
    building the telemetry around: same `head_sha`, first attempt fails,
    a later attempt (via `run rerun --failed`) succeeds with no code change
    in between.

## Request

Operator (2026-09-27, verbatim): "File it, and then prepare a handoff to
tackle getting the CI running reliably and clean. If we have any way to dig
up flakiness telemetry over run history, let's build out tracking for that,
find the noisiest and blocking issues, and fix them"

## Plan

### Phase 0 — Reconcile with the existing reactive-fix effort — Done
- [x] Read `efforts/active/promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent/README.md`
  and the `ci-failure-remediation` vision in full; determine what detection/
  dedup machinery already exists (issue-filing on a red run) and whether this
  effort's telemetry should feed that mechanism, extend it, or stay separate.
  Avoid building a second, competing "notice CI is red" pipeline.
  **Resolved (2026-09-27):** the two efforts are complementary, not
  competing, and stay architecturally separate:
  - `promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent` (`tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py`)
    is **event-triggered, single-run, real-time**: it reacts to one
    `workflow_run` completion on `dev`, computes a per-test (or whole-job)
    failure signature, dedupes against an already-open Gitea issue, and
    files/comments — it has no concept of run *history* and does not look
    backward.
  - This effort (`ci-flakiness-telemetry-and-reliability`) is
    **batch/on-demand, historical, retrospective**: it mines the GitHub
    Actions REST API's run history across a lookback window to find
    *recurring, high-impact* noise (rerun-recovery rate, blocking impact)
    that no single red run reveals on its own.
  - **What is shared, not duplicated:** the failure-signature computation
    itself. `tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py`'s `signature_key()` /
    `build_signatures()` (job name + failing pytest node id, or a
    whole-job fallback keyed off a stripped log tail) is the **one**
    canonical signature identity in this repo. Phase 1's telemetry pipeline
    must import and reuse those functions directly rather than
    reimplementing a second, subtly-different signature scheme — two
    schemes for "is this the same failure" would silently disagree and
    undermine both efforts' own dedup guarantees.
  - **No pipeline merge:** the watchdog stays a `workflow_run`-triggered
    Actions job (real-time reaction); the telemetry pipeline stays a
    separate, independently-invoked script (periodic/on-demand mining).
    A future integration (e.g. the watchdog consulting historical
    recurrence counts to enrich its own issue body) is plausible but
    explicitly out of scope for this effort — noted here, not built here.

### Phase 1 — Telemetry pipeline _(agent-recommended shape; operator asked for "any way to dig up ... telemetry," not a specific design)_ — Done
- [x] Design and land a script (likely `tools/ci-telemetry.py` or similar) that
  pulls historical workflow-run + job data via the GitHub Actions REST API for
  `dev` (and optionally PR-triggered runs) over a bounded lookback window.
  **Implemented:** `tools/ci_telemetry.py` (`refresh`/`report` subcommands);
  fetches both `dev`-push runs and PR-triggered `ci.yml` runs.
- [x] Persist results queryably (a checked-in SQLite db is the lightest option
  consistent with this repo's existing tooling conventions — check for
  precedent before inventing a new storage shape; a periodic refresh job is a
  later concern, not this phase's). **Implemented:** local SQLite db
  (`tools/ci_telemetry.sqlite3`, gitignored — regenerate via `refresh` rather
  than checking in a snapshot; whether a periodic-refresh job should check
  one in instead is a later decision, not this phase's).
- [x] Detect the **same-commit-reran-and-passed** signal precisely (matches
  this session's own empirical evidence of flaky vs. genuine failures) as the
  primary flakiness heuristic, distinct from a failure that persists until a
  real code fix lands. **Implemented, with a real production correction:**
  `gh run rerun --failed` reuses the SAME `run_id` at a higher `run_attempt`
  rather than creating a new run — a plain `dev`-push run-history mine alone
  (0 multi-attempt runs observed in that history) would silently show 0%
  recovery everywhere. The rerun-recovery signal is observed almost
  exclusively on **PR-time** (`ci.yml`) reruns instead (confirmed live: 8
  multi-attempt PR runs in a 7-day window). `fetch_runs`/`_fetch_prior_attempts`
  fetch each earlier attempt via the `.../attempts/{n}` and
  `.../attempts/{n}/jobs` endpoints explicitly. A second real bug found and
  fixed in the same pass: both attempts share an *identical* top-level
  `created_at` (no distinct per-attempt timestamp in the fetched fields), so
  sorting by `created_at` alone left attempts in fetch/insertion order
  (latest-first) and silently hid every real recovery; `compute_flaky_shas`/
  `compute_blocking_impact` now sort by `(created_at, run_id, attempt)`,
  with a dedicated regression test locking in the fix.
- [x] Surface, per distinct test/job/check identity: total failure count,
  rerun-recovery rate (flaky signal), and **blocking impact** — how many
  *other* PRs/commits were stalled behind each failure (tie back to the
  dev->main promotion-stall pattern this session found: a run that must reach
  `conclusion: success` to trigger promotion). **Implemented:**
  `compute_signature_stats` + `render_report`; blocking impact is computed
  only over `dev`-push runs (a genuine serialized queue), never PR-time runs
  (concurrent, unrelated PRs have no single queue to block).
- [x] 48 unit tests (`tools/test_ci_telemetry.py`) cover the pure aggregation
  logic in isolation (no `gh` calls); `ruff check` clean.

### Phase 2 — Find the noisiest and most blocking
- [x] Run the pipeline over available history; produce a ranked report (by
  frequency, and separately by blocking impact — a rare-but-always-fatal
  failure ranks differently than a frequent-but-quickly-recovered one).
  **Done, live, 2026-09-27** (7-day lookback, `dev`-push + PR-triggered):
  noisiest by frequency is `tools/test_check_marketplace_isolation.py::
  test_payload_catalog_adopter_capabilities_avoid_bare_global_commands` (23
  occurrences); highest blocking impact is
  `tests/test_install_signed_python_probe.py::
  test_missing_newest_candidate_does_not_abort_probe[pwsh]` (122 `dev`-push
  runs stalled behind it, likely explained by low natural `dev`-push
  frequency for a rare-but-fatal failure, exactly the asymmetry this ranking
  exists to expose). See the Journal for the full report.
- [x] Include the `identifier leak guard` misconfiguration explicitly in the
  ranking even though it isn't a "failure" in the traditional sense — it's
  100% noisy, 0% blocking (not a required check), which the ranking should be
  able to express, not just silently omit. **Do not re-plan its fix here** —
  it is already fully tracked in `efforts/active/ci-identifier-leak-guard/`
  (#3923), which owns the `FORBIDDEN_IDS_FACILITY`/`FORBIDDEN_IDS_WORK`
  secret setup end-to-end; this effort only needs to confirm the telemetry
  correctly stops flagging it once that effort lands. **Implemented:**
  `KNOWN_NOISY_NONBLOCKING_CHECKS` (hand-tracked, not auto-mined — the PR
  check-suite API is a genuinely separate surface from workflow-run history
  and not worth a second live-fetch path for one entry); `render_report`
  surfaces it in its own dedicated section. `fetch_failures_for_run` also
  explicitly excludes the organically-observed `identifier leak guard` job
  from PR-run mining (`PR_SKIP_JOB_NAMES`) so it can never double-count under
  a second, differently-derived key.
- [x] Confirm the downstream tracker (`test_first_use_provision_is_serialized`)
  surfaces near the top given this session's direct, repeated observation of
  it; use it as a sanity check for the pipeline's own correctness.
  **Confirmed, live, 2026-09-27:** the matching signature
  (`plugins/agent-index/test_generate.py::test_first_use_provision_is_serialized`
  — the same lock-race pattern in a different plugin's vendored copy of the
  same lib) surfaced with 12 occurrences and a **42% rerun-recovery rate
  (5/12)** — a real, non-trivial, non-zero recovery signal, which is exactly
  what this known flake should produce and the strongest available
  confirmation the pipeline's own logic (not just its plumbing) is correct.

### Phase 3 — Fix the top offenders
- [x] Fix the downstream tracker (tighten the lock-serialization test/harness so
  the race is deterministic under CI load, per that issue's own body).
  **Fixed, 2026-09-27:** root-caused via direct instrumented reproduction
  (not guesswork) to a genuine TOCTOU in `posix-shim.tmpl`'s flock-less
  fallback lock: a stale lock's "owner is dead" verdict was checked, then
  the lock destroyed unconditionally by path -- letting one racer destroy
  a FRESH lock a different racer had already recreated in the gap. Fixed
  by serializing the reap decision-and-destroy behind a `mkdir`-based
  mutex, re-verifying staleness fresh immediately before the actual
  destroy. Also fixed the identical, independently-duplicated lock in
  `plugins/agent-machines/scripts/invoke-payload-runtime.sh`. Validated
  300/300 clean runs (vs. a real, reproduced ~5-10% failure rate on the
  unfixed code, confirmed twice across two different intermediate fix
  attempts before the final one held). See that PR for the full
  reproduction methodology and trace evidence.
- [ ] Resolve the `identifier leak guard` noise **by driving the existing
  `efforts/active/ci-identifier-leak-guard/` effort (#3923) to completion**,
  not by re-planning it here — that effort already owns the
  `FORBIDDEN_IDS_FACILITY`/`FORBIDDEN_IDS_WORK` secret setup.
- [ ] Work down the Phase 2 ranking, opening one PR per fix (or a small
  batch when fixes are trivially related), closing/updating private-downstream-repo
  issues as each lands.
  **Important refinement found 2026-09-27 (must inform how the rest of
  this Plan item proceeds):** most of the Phase 2 ranking's high-frequency/
  high-blocking-impact entries are **not standing code bugs** the way
  #7715 was. Directly verified live against current `dev` HEAD:
  `tools/test_check_marketplace_isolation.py::
  test_payload_catalog_adopter_capabilities_avoid_bare_global_commands`
  (23 occurrences, 0% recovery) and
  `plugins/copilot-extensions-harness/tests/test_session_context_declarations.py::
  test_static_projection_plugins_register_no_session_start_hook` (9
  occurrences) both **pass cleanly right now** -- there is no current
  failure to fix. These are cross-cutting content-governance guards that
  scan skill/agent docs (or session-hook wiring) across MANY plugins at
  once; a failure means a *specific, different* PR's own in-progress doc
  edit tripped it that day, and that PR's author fixed their own content
  before merge (0% recovery makes sense: a genuine content mistake never
  clears via a mere rerun, and it was never actually stuck on `dev` -- each
  historical occurrence was a different PR's own pre-merge iteration, not
  a persisting regression). **This is the check working as intended, not
  noise to eliminate or a bug to fix.** Do not "fix" these by editing the
  checks or the test suite; there is nothing broken. This is a real
  limitation of the Phase 2 ranking worth being explicit about (it can't
  currently distinguish "one persisting bug recurring" from "many
  different authors independently tripping the same working guardrail")
  -- a future refinement could correlate each occurrence's run against
  that PR's own eventual merge state, but that's out of scope for this
  pass.
  **Former candidate, now believed historical (pending post-#4239
  confirmation) -- not currently actionable:**
  `plugins/agent-logger/tests/test_install_signed_python_probe.py::
  test_missing_newest_candidate_does_not_abort_probe[pwsh]` (19
  occurrences, 122 blocked `dev`-push runs in the original 7-day-lookback
  ranking -- the highest blocking impact in that ranking) looked like a
  genuine Windows-runner probe-script bug, unrelated to any PR's own doc
  content.
  **2026-09-27 investigation, corrected after review:** 20/20 local runs
  via `tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-logger` (Windows dev box) stayed
  green. A first pass here cited a historical failure excerpt from
  PR-triggered `ci.yml` run 36302713272 (commit `60a62be1`) as open
  evidence -- **that was wrong, caught by review**: `60a62be1` is the
  commit *immediately before* PR #4239 (`e305b70c3`, merged 9 minutes
  later the same day, 2026-09-27), which added exactly the
  `os.name != "nt"` skip guard this test now carries. The cited failure
  (a POSIX `/tmp/...` path, an Ubuntu job) is simply the original,
  already-fixed bug #4239 fixed -- not new evidence of a still-open
  problem. Searched failed PR-triggered `ci.yml` runs created after
  #4239's merge timestamp (12 found in the available run-history window)
  for any matching `agent-logger` job failure: **none found.** This
  signature's Phase 2 ranking occurrences are very likely entirely
  historical noise predating its own fix (#4239), not a currently-open
  Phase 3 item -- **not confirmed conclusively**, since the check only
  covered the runs available via the API at the time, not a fresh
  telemetry `refresh` scoped by date. Note: `tools/ci_telemetry.py`
  currently only supports a *relative* `--lookback-days` window, not an
  absolute since-date/since-commit filter, so "start strictly after
  2026-09-27" isn't directly expressible with today's CLI. The concretely
  actionable next step, if this is picked up again: once several days have
  passed (so that `--lookback-days` set smaller than the day-count since
  2026-09-27 naturally excludes `60a62be1`/`e305b70c3` from the window),
  re-run `refresh` and confirm the signature's occurrence count is zero.
  Adding an absolute `--since` filter to the CLI would make this cleaner
  and is a reasonable small follow-up, not yet done. If the signature
  recurs even once on a run created after the guard existed, that would be
  genuinely new evidence worth investigating from scratch.

## Validation Plan

- [x] The telemetry pipeline's own output is spot-checked against this
  session's direct manual findings (the two genuine #4239/#4242 regressions,
  the #7715 flake, the identifier-leak-guard noise) before trusting it for
  anything not already manually confirmed. **Confirmed 2026-09-27**: #7715's
  matching signature surfaced with a real 42% recovery rate (Phase 2); the
  identifier-leak-guard entry renders in its own dedicated section (Phase 2).
  #4239/#4242 predate this pipeline's lookback window and were never
  re-checked directly — not a gap in the pipeline itself, just outside the
  window this session's 7-day validation run covered.
- [ ] After Phase 3's fixes land, re-run the telemetry pipeline over a fresh
  window and confirm the fixed items' failure/noise rate actually dropped
  (not just that a fix merged) — a fix that doesn't move the needle in the
  telemetry itself is not yet proven.
- [ ] `dev`'s CI achieves a materially higher clean-run rate than the "0/10
  observed" baseline this session measured on 2026-09-27 (see the
  mux-daemon-fix session history for that measurement) over a comparable
  observation window.

## Proposal

_Pending — Phase 3 findings (which fixes land, and in what order) will
determine whether this section needs anything beyond the Plan above._

## Journal

### 2026-10-03 — Fresh ranked report; agent-logger coverage-baseline root-caused (round 4)
- Refreshed telemetry (7-day lookback, 1700 run/attempt rows, 384 failure
  occurrences). Mux-daemon flaky-test entries (`test_terminate_mux_daemon_pid_*`)
  confirmed resolved by PR #5017 (merged independently, same day) --
  occurrences stop exactly at its merge timestamp.
- `tools/test_check_marketplace_isolation.py::
  test_payload_catalog_adopter_capabilities_avoid_bare_global_commands` was
  a GENUINE currently-failing standing bug (not historical noise like the
  other content-governance entries) -- `agent-dispatch`'s own
  `troubleshooting-agent-dispatch/SKILL.md` used 15 bare
  `agent-dispatch`/`agent-bridge`/`agent-mcp` command invocations instead of
  the `<agent-dispatch catalog argv[0]>` placeholder convention every other
  compliant skill in the repo already follows. Drafted a fix locally
  (verified 18/18 marketplace-isolation tests passing), but another
  contributor landed the identical fix concurrently (PRs #5037/#5039,
  merged ahead of this one) -- dropped the duplicate during rebase and
  confirmed the rebased tree matches their merged fix exactly.
- Confirmed as historical-only (already passes cleanly on current `dev`
  HEAD, no occurrences since their original burst window; NOT a Phase 3
  action item): `test_shipped_projections_fit_the_budgets[context-handoff]`
  / `test_context_handoff_handoff_fallback_projection_is_valid` (one
  13.5-hour burst, 2026-09-29, zero since) and
  `test_shipped_projections_fit_the_budgets[agent-worktrees]` (Sept 28-Oct 2,
  zero since). Same content-governance-noise pattern established in the
  2026-09-27 entry below.
- `tests/test_command_boundary.py::
  test_installers_preserve_two_step_cuda_engine_swap` -- the single highest
  blocking-impact entry in the fresh ranking (57 occurrences, 1992 `dev`-push
  runs stalled) -- confirmed entirely historical: all 57 occurrences fall in
  a single ~20-hour window (2026-09-27), zero since, passes cleanly now.
  Likely active-development churn on the agent-index-engine-daemon /
  agent-index-server-package-split effort, already resolved.
- `tests/test_skill_payload.py::test_cleaning_codespaces_skill_contract` --
  new today, already has an open fix PR (#5043) from another contributor;
  not re-done here.
- **`agent-logger` coverage-baseline collection -- round 4, new root cause
  found.** The same `validate-and-promote`-blocking `encodings` bootstrap
  crash this repo's prior session (PR #5007) thought it had fixed (a
  PYTHONHOME/PYTHONPATH/VIRTUAL_ENV/`__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__` env leak)
  recurred identically on the next real CI run even with that fix merged.
  Direct evidence from the job log: the "Coverage baseline" step runs
  pytest via `uv run --with coverage ...` on a uv-managed Python 3.10
  interpreter -- meaning pytest itself executes from INSIDE uv's own
  ephemeral venv. `test_runtime_gate.py::_fake_runtime()` calls
  `venv.EnvBuilder(with_pip=False).create(slot)` to build its disposable
  test venv -- a venv-of-a-venv, which CPython did not correctly handle
  until 3.11's `sys._base_executable` fix (gh-84559); under 3.10 the new
  venv's `pyvenv.cfg` records "home" as the ephemeral uv venv's own
  directory rather than chasing through to the real interpreter, so the
  created venv's python binary can't find its own stdlib the moment
  anything invokes it fresh -- the exact `encodings` crash. Fixed by
  resolving the REAL root interpreter via `sys.base_exec_prefix` (stable
  across any venv nesting depth, unlike `sys.executable`) and spawning
  THAT interpreter's own `-m venv` instead of calling `EnvBuilder.create()`
  in-process. Cannot be reproduced locally (no WSL/bash + no uv-managed
  Python 3.10 nested-venv combination on this Windows box); the next
  `validate-and-promote` run is the real confirmation.
- Next: land both fixes above, confirm the next `validate-and-promote` run
  goes green (agent-logger's coverage baseline specifically), then re-run
  telemetry over a fresh window per the Validation Plan.

### 2026-09-27 — Signed-python-probe investigation corrected after review
- A Copilot review on the PR carrying the prior entry (below) correctly
  caught that the "investigation evidence" cited there was stale: the
  failing run's commit (`60a62be1`) is the one immediately *before* PR
  #4239 (`e305b70c3`, merged 9 minutes later the same day) added the
  `os.name != "nt"` skip guard this test now carries -- the cited POSIX
  `/tmp/...` path and empty-probe-result failure is simply the original
  bug #4239 already fixed, not new evidence of a still-open problem.
- Searched failed PR-triggered `ci.yml` runs created after #4239's merge
  timestamp for a matching `agent-logger` job failure: none found among
  the runs available via the API at check time. Not a conclusive proof of
  zero recurrence (the check didn't cover the full historical window a
  fresh telemetry `refresh` would), but no evidence found of the bug
  recurring since its own fix landed.
- Net effect: this signature is very likely NOT a currently-open Phase 3
  item at all -- its Phase 2 ranking occurrences were most likely entirely
  historical, predating and then resolved by #4239. The effort's own
  Journal/Plan sections above and below have been corrected to stop
  pointing at it as an active next step. See the Phase 3 Plan item above
  for the concrete (CLI-capability-aware) next step if this is picked up
  again -- `tools/ci_telemetry.py` only supports a relative
  `--lookback-days` window today, not an absolute since-date filter.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 2 ranking refinement: content-governance noise vs. real bugs
- Directly verified two of the Phase 2 ranking's top entries
  (marketplace-isolation bare-command check, session-context-declarations
  hook-wiring check) against current `dev` HEAD: both pass cleanly right
  now. Concluded these are cross-cutting content-governance guards that
  many *different* PR authors independently trip during their own
  in-progress doc edits, always fixed before merge -- not standing code
  bugs, and not this effort's to fix. See the Phase 3 Plan item above for
  the full reasoning; the `test_install_signed_python_probe.py` signature
  was investigated separately (see the later dated entry above) and is
  very likely historical, not a confirmed open Phase 3 item.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 3 first item: flaky first-use provisioning fixed
- Reproduced the flake directly (read-only diagnostic sub-agents, WSL,
  ~5-10% failure rate observed across repeated runs) rather than guessing
  from the shell logic alone -- pure code-reading had suggested the
  existing lock SHOULD have been race-free, which turned out to be wrong.
- Root cause, found via instrumented tracing of the actual interleaving:
  a genuine TOCTOU in `posix-shim.tmpl`'s flock-less fallback lock's
  stale-lock reap step. A first fix attempt (atomic `mv`-based claim
  instead of blind `rm -f`) reduced but did not eliminate the race (5/100)
  -- a second instrumented reproduction showed the staleness *decision*
  itself (made before the destroy) could still go stale by the time the
  destroy ran. Final fix: serialize the reap decision-and-destroy behind a
  `mkdir`-based mutex, re-verifying staleness fresh inside it. Validated
  300/300 clean runs after the final fix.
- Also fixed the identical, independently-duplicated lock pattern in
  `plugins/agent-machines/scripts/invoke-payload-runtime.sh` (same bug),
  and regenerated all checked-in shims that embed the shared template
  (`agent-dispatch`, `agent-pull-requests`, `budget-guidance`) to stay in
  sync.
- Next: work down the Phase 2 ranking (identifier-leak-guard noise is
  already owned by #3923; the marketplace-isolation test and the
  signed-python-probe test are the next concrete Phase 3 candidates).

### 2026-09-27 — Phases 1/2 built and validated live
- Landed `tools/ci_telemetry.py` (`refresh`/`report`) + 21 new unit tests
  (`tools/test_ci_telemetry.py`), all passing (48/48 total across both
  telemetry files), `ruff check` clean.
- Real production correction made mid-build: the rerun-recovery signal is
  observed almost exclusively on **PR-time** (`ci.yml`) reruns, not
  `dev`-push runs (0 multi-attempt runs found in 394 `dev`-push runs scanned;
  8 found in a 7-day PR-run window) — `gh run rerun --failed` reuses the same
  `run_id` at a higher `run_attempt` rather than creating a new run, which a
  naive `runs?event=push` mine never sees. Added `_fetch_prior_attempts` +
  attempt-scoped jobs/log fetching to recover this.
- Second bug found and fixed in the same pass: both attempts of a rerun
  share an *identical* top-level `created_at`, so sorting by `created_at`
  alone left them in fetch/insertion order (latest-attempt-first) and
  silently zeroed out every real recovery signal; fixed by sorting on
  `(created_at, run_id, attempt)`, with a dedicated regression test.
- Ran a real 7-day-lookback `refresh` (1403 run/attempt rows, 121 failure
  occurrences persisted) and confirmed both Validation Plan spot-checks this
  phase could reach: the downstream tracker's matching signature showed a real
  42% (5/12) recovery rate, and the identifier-leak-guard entry renders in
  its own tracked, non-mined section. Full Phase 2 ranked report:
  noisiest by frequency `tools/test_check_marketplace_isolation.py::
  test_payload_catalog_adopter_capabilities_avoid_bare_global_commands` (23
  occurrences, 0% recovery — a persisting issue, not a flake); highest
  blocking impact `tests/test_install_signed_python_probe.py::
  test_missing_newest_candidate_does_not_abort_probe[pwsh]` (122 `dev`-push
  runs stalled). Both are strong Phase 3 candidates alongside #7715.
- Next: Phase 3 — fix the downstream tracker, then work down the ranking.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 0 reconciliation resolved
- Read `promotion-failure-reactive-fix-agent`'s README in full and the
  `ci-failure-remediation` vision. Confirmed the two efforts are
  complementary (real-time single-run reaction vs. batch historical
  mining), not competing, and that they must share exactly one canonical
  failure-signature computation (`tools/ci_failure_watchdog.py`'s
  `signature_key()`/`build_signatures()`) rather than each growing its own.
  See the Phase 0 Plan item above for the full decision. Proceeding to
  Phase 1 (telemetry pipeline).

### 2026-09-27 — Kickoff
- Effort created directly following a live session that root-caused and fixed
  two `dev`-CI-stalling regressions (#4239, #4242), closed a governance gap
  (CODEOWNERS + review-gate rulesets) that let them merge red, and along the
  way surfaced a repeat flaky test (the downstream tracker) and a permanently-red
  non-blocking `identifier leak guard` check. Operator asked to file the flake
  and hand off toward systematic flakiness telemetry + fixing the noisiest/
  blocking issues, rather than continuing to react one flake at a time.
