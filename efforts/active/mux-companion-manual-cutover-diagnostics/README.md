## Guiding Intent

The operator runs context-handoff in `mode: manual-only` while ironing out
cutover quirks, but still wants an on-demand way to exercise the SAME
claim → spawn-successor → retire-predecessor machinery `mode: auto` would run
automatically — from inside the Mux Companion (Ctrl-K), as an explicit,
human-gated diagnostic trigger. Then, after either that trigger or the classic
manual `/clear` + paste-`HANDOFF_SEED` flow, the operator wants to reopen the
Companion and see, unambiguously, whether the Worktree Picker's resolved head
now correctly points at the new session — with the previous and new session
both listed, so a mismatch is visible immediately rather than discovered later
when Resume launches the wrong one.

This is **not** a new cutover mechanism. The real machinery already exists,
proven end-to-end in `handoff-live-cutover` (#2249) for the automatic path;
this effort exposes an explicit, human-invoked on-demand counterpart, mirrors
the precedent `agent-worktrees handoffs-check --execute` already set for the
retire half, and adds no new behavior when the operator does not press the
button.

## Context

### Prior art (directly reused, not rebuilt)

- **`handoff-live-cutover`** (#2249, Active — core complete) — the automatic
  live-cutover mechanism itself: `context-handoff`'s `triggerHandoff()`
  (arms the pending-handoff ledger + activity signal when
  `automaticHandoffEnabled(mode)`), and `agent-worktrees`' resident
  status-monitor (`_monitor_maybe_process_handoff_record` → claim → spawn via
  the existing `handoff-cutover` CLI verb → retire the predecessor pane).
  This effort's Step 3 verb is an on-demand invocation of that SAME function,
  not a reimplementation.
- **A reviewed safety gate this effort must not weaken for the automatic
  path**: `triggerHandoff()`'s `autoEnabled` computation
  (`automaticHandoffEnabled(mode)`) deliberately withholds the
  `pending_handoffs` ledger write in `manual-only` mode — a Copilot review
  finding on PR #3041 ("a 'manual-only' handoff could otherwise still get
  auto-launched by the monitor through this exact path, defeating the entire
  opt-in gate"). Step 2's `force` parameter is an explicit, separate opt-in a
  caller must pass deliberately (never inferred from config) — the automatic
  path's behavior is unchanged.
- **`agent-worktrees handoffs-check --execute`** — the established precedent
  for "an explicit, on-demand counterpart to the resident monitor's own
  automatic sweep" (its own docstring's phrasing), for the retire half only.
  Step 3 is the same pattern, extended to the claim+spawn half.
- **`visions/mux-companion`** — already specifies session-lineage display and
  a read-only pending-handoff headline (built in `worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul`
  Phase 8); its Non-Goals currently forbid the Companion invoking cutover at
  all, which Step 1 must revise to carve out this narrow, explicit exception.

### Net-new in this effort

No prior art covers: a `force` bypass of the mode:auto gate, an on-demand
single-worktree claim+spawn+retire verb, the Companion's "Cut over" button, or
Companion-side post-cutover head-verification (a refreshable session-lineage
view highlighting whether resolved head matches the just-resumed session).

## Request

> My intent with the Handoff helper in the Companion is that when the agent in
> a worktree says it's made the handoff or called trigger_handoff, I should be
> able to open Ctrl-K, see an entry for "Pending handoff" as a button, and then
> press a button to "Cut over". The Companion should then execute the cutover

## Plan

### Step 1 — Revise `visions/mux-companion`
- [ ] Add two Features: an explicit, human-gated manual cutover trigger
      (distinct from the already-speced, more dangerous raw
      `break-glass-head-override`), and post-cutover head verification
      (session lineage + a head-match marker, refreshable on demand).
- [ ] Revise Non-Goals: "not a handoff orchestrator" must be scoped to mean
      "never composes, decides, or silently invokes a cutover" — not "can
      never invoke the graceful path on explicit human command." Cross-link
      the PR #3041 safety gate this stays underneath.

### Step 2 — `context-handoff`: explicit `force` bypass (Done 2026-09-28)
- [x] `triggerHandoff()` gains a `force` boolean (default `false`); when set,
      `autoEnabled = automaticHandoffEnabled(mode) || force`. Never inferred
      from config -- an explicit, separate caller-supplied opt-in only.
- [x] `handoff-cli.mjs trigger` gains `--force`, wired through.
- [x] Tests: force arms the ledger/activity signal in `manual-only` mode;
      omitting force preserves today's exact behavior (regression coverage
      for PR #3041's own fix).

### Step 3 — `agent-worktrees`: on-demand claim+spawn+retire verb (Done 2026-09-28)
- [x] New CLI verb `handoff-cutover-trigger --worktree-id <id> [--json]`
      that runs `_monitor_maybe_process_handoff_record` for ONE worktree,
      on demand -- the SAME function the resident daemon calls per tick.
      No `--execute`/preview split (unlike `handoffs-check`): invoking the
      verb IS the explicit human action. Reports resolved head + session
      count before/after so a caller can tell whether anything changed.
- [x] Tests: claims + spawns via the existing, unmodified daemon
      choreography (no new spawn logic written); a second concurrent
      on-demand call (or the real daemon, if running) safely no-ops via the
      existing hardlink claim (unchanged, untouched by this step).

### Step 4 — `worktree-manager`: Mux Companion UI (Done 2026-09-28)
- [x] "Cut over" button, shown only when `pending_handoff` is set (disabled
      otherwise); invokes Step 3's verb directly. Step 3 was extended to
      auto-arm the ledger from the unconditionally-written session-state
      marker itself, so the Companion never needs to separately shell out
      to context-handoff's `--force` -- one call, one process boundary.
- [x] "Refresh" button reloads the whole view (status + lineage + pending-
      handoff + Cut-over enablement) in place, so reopening after a manual
      `/clear` + paste-seed resume, or after Cut over, shows updated state
      without exiting Mux.
- [x] Explicitly NOT built (per the operator's own request): no
      auto-repair-head or auto-file-a-bug action in the Companion itself --
      a detected mismatch is surfaced for the operator to hand to the
      current session to patch up and file, not acted on by the Companion.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Live-tested in this operator's own manual-mode worktree: press "Cut
      over" on a genuinely pending handoff, confirm a real successor spawns
      and the predecessor pane retires.
- [ ] Live-tested: after a manual `/clear` + paste-`HANDOFF_SEED` resume
      (no button), reopening the Companion shows the new session as head.
- [x] Unit tests green per step; `tools/check-module-size.py` clean.

## Journal

### 2026-09-27 — Kickoff
- Effort created out of live operator feedback on the Phase 8 (read-only
  pending-handoff headline) slice of `worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul`. Original
  ask ("Cut over" button that just works) ran into a real, reviewed safety
  gate (PR #3041) withholding the pending-handoff ledger write in
  `manual-only` mode -- confirmed by reading `triggerHandoff()`'s exact
  gating rather than guessing. Operator confirmed: full-spawn behavior, no
  auto-repair/auto-file (operator will tell the current session to do that
  themselves), revise the vision first, and specifically asked for the
  `save`/`trigger`/`force` three-way split that became Step 2. Tracked as
  its own effort (not reopening the now-closed `worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul`)
  per the operator's own call, cross-linked to `handoff-live-cutover` (#2249)
  as the mechanism this builds an on-demand counterpart for.

### 2026-09-28 — Step 1 (vision) merged; Step 2 (context-handoff force) complete
- Step 1 landed as PR #4371: `visions/mux-companion` now carries
  `manual-cutover-trigger` and `post-cutover-head-verification` as Features,
  with three new/revised Behaviors precisely bounding the exception (never
  inferred, never authors a handoff, detects-never-repairs).
- Step 2: `triggerHandoff()` gains `force = false`; `autoEnabled =
  automaticHandoffEnabled(mode) || force`. `handoff-cli.mjs trigger` gains
  `--force`, registered as a boolean flag (not a value-taking one).
  Regression-tested against the exact PR #3041 scenario (omitting force
  preserves manual-only's prior behavior byte-for-byte: `noteHandoff`/
  activity/bridge all skipped, `automaticCutoverDisabled: true`); a new
  force=true test proves all three signals now fire.
- **Near-miss worth recording**: an initial CLI-level end-to-end test
  (`trigger --force` via a real spawned subprocess, unmocked) actually
  invoked live `agent-worktrees`/`agent-dispatch` provisioning inside an
  isolated temp HOME -- 164s runtime, a fresh `agent-dispatch` runtime
  install (cryptography/rust bindings and all), and an EPERM cleanup
  failure on a locked `.pyd` from the mid-test install. Removed that test
  in favor of a fast, side-effect-free structural check (the CLI wires
  `force: Boolean(args.force)` through and registers `force` as a boolean
  flag) -- the actual arming behavior is already fully covered by
  `handoff-core.test.mjs`'s properly-injected/mocked tests. Lesson for the
  remaining steps: never spawn the real CLI for a code path that can reach
  live provisioning, even in an "isolated" temp HOME.
- Tests: `handoff-core.test.mjs` 52/52 (2 new); `cli-parity.test.mjs` 8/8
  (1 new, replacing the risky one); full `tests/*.test.mjs` suite 142
  passed/11 skipped/0 failed (unchanged skip count from baseline).
  `tools/check-module-size.py` clean.
- **Step 3 complete**: `handoff-cutover-trigger --worktree-id <id>`, a thin
  wrapper around `_monitor_maybe_process_handoff_record` (unchanged,
  untouched -- the exact function the resident daemon calls per tick).
  Deliberately no `--execute`/preview split like `handoffs-check` has: the
  underlying check functions this wraps (`_monitor_pending_handoff_request`)
  have a one-shot CLAIM side effect baked in, so a "peek first, execute
  later" two-call design would silently self-block on its own claim. Reports
  `head_before`/`head_after`/`session_count_before`/`_after`/`changed` so a
  caller (the Companion, Step 4) can tell whether anything happened without
  needing its own unsafe second call into the daemon's check logic.
  Wired via the same lazy dispatch-table pattern every other verb in
  `__main__.py` uses (`handoff_cli.py` owns the parser + handler; `__main__`
  re-exports it). Nudged the already-grandfathered `__main__.py` ceiling by
  3 lines (7072 -> 7075, `tools/module-size-baseline.json`) -- the same,
  already-established registration boilerplate every other verb pays.
- Tests: 4 new in `test_handoff_cutover.py` (unknown worktree errors;
  no-actionable-handoff is a silent successful no-op; a successful spawn's
  head/session-count change is reported; human-readable output for the
  no-op case) -- all green (107/107 in that file). Broader
  `test_status_segment.py`/`test_tracking.py` unaffected (262/262).
  `tools/check-module-size.py` clean after the baseline nudge.
- **Next up**: Step 4 (Mux Companion "Cut over" button + refreshable
  session-lineage/head-match verification) -- the last step.

### 2026-09-28 — Step 3 revisited + Step 4 complete: this effort's Plan is fully executed
- **Revisited Step 3 before building the Companion on top of it**: the
  original design assumed the Companion would separately call
  context-handoff's `trigger --force` (Step 2) to arm the ledger, THEN call
  `handoff-cutover-trigger`. Building Step 4 surfaced that this means a
  SECOND process boundary (the Companion, Python, would need to locate and
  shell out to a Node CLI too) for something `handoff-cutover-trigger`
  could arm itself, in pure Python, using data ALREADY available to it:
  the session-state `handoff-request.json` marker `writeSessionStateHandoff`
  writes UNCONDITIONALLY (regardless of mode) already carries the exact
  `handoffId`/token `tracking.open_handoff` needs. Added
  `_arm_pending_handoff_from_session_state` to `handoff-cutover-trigger`:
  before running the daemon's own choreography, it scans the worktree's
  registered sessions for an unconsumed session-state marker not yet
  reflected in the ledger, and opens it directly (idempotent -- a token
  already present is left alone). This means `handoff-cutover-trigger`
  now works standing completely alone, whether or not `--force` was ever
  separately invoked -- Step 2's `--force` remains independently valuable
  as a plain CLI escape hatch (matching the operator's own "prepare"/
  "trigger"/"force" mental model) but is no longer load-bearing for the
  Companion's own "Cut over" button. 2 new tests
  (`test_arms_ledger_from_unconsumed_session_state_marker_before_
  processing`, `test_does_not_rearm_an_already_open_token`) -- 6/6 in
  `TestCmdHandoffCutoverTrigger`, 109/109 in the full file.
- **Step 4**: `handoff_client.trigger_cutover()` shells out to
  `handoff-cutover-trigger --json`; the Companion gains a "Cut over" button
  (enabled only when `pending_handoff` is set) and a "Refresh" button, both
  driving a new `_refresh_view()` that reloads `_load_current_worktree()`
  and repaints status/lineage/pending-handoff/button-enablement in place --
  satisfying post-cutover-head-verification's "refreshable on demand, not
  just at popup-open" requirement without needing a separate head-match
  marker (the lineage table's existing `●` head marker already IS that,
  once reloaded). A "Cut over" outcome (or failure) renders as a message
  below the status explanation. Per the operator's own explicit request,
  NO auto-repair or auto-file-a-bug action exists anywhere in the Companion.
- **Found and fixed a genuine pre-existing bug while writing the first-ever
  real Textual mount test for this file**: `mux_companion.py`'s CSS used
  Rich-style numbered grey names (`grey19`/`grey27`/`grey42`/`grey70`),
  which the installed Textual version's CSS parser rejects outright
  ("Did you mean 'grey'?") -- the app had literally never been mounted by
  any test before (the file's own docstring said so explicitly: "not any
  Textual rendering"), so this had shipped broken and unnoticed. Replaced
  every occurrence with equivalent hex (`#303030`/`#454545`/`#6c6c6c`/
  `#b2b2b2`) across the WHOLE file (my own new CSS rules used the same
  broken names, too, copying the existing style). Verified by adding one
  real `run_test()`-driven end-to-end test (compose -> mount -> click
  "Cut over" -> observe the repainted status/lineage/button state) --
  the first genuine integration-level coverage this module has ever had,
  not just its pure-function unit tests.
- Tests: `test_mux_companion.py` 20/20 (6 new: action-message rendering,
  4 pure `_cut_over()` behavior tests, 1 end-to-end `run_test()` test).
  Full `tests/` suite green apart from 3 already-known-pre-existing,
  unrelated failures (the machine-load-sensitive Picker modal-timing flake
  documented in earlier phases; two genuinely unrelated failures --
  `test_mux_daemon.py`'s backstop-cadence test and `test_trusted_
  materializer_parity.py`'s editable-reference test -- both reproduced
  identically on an unmodified checkout via `git stash`). `tools/check-
  module-size.py` clean.
- **This is the last step in this effort's Plan.** The Validation Plan's
  two live-test items are the operator's own to exercise (a real pending
  handoff, a real manual `/clear` + paste-seed resume) -- left unchecked
  here since they need the operator's own worktree/session, not something
  checkable from within a dev session. Everything buildable is built and
  merged.
