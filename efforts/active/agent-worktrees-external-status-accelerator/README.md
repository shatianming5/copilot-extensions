# agent-worktrees — External-Status-Consumer Accelerator

- **Slug:** `agent-worktrees-external-status-accelerator`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions (plugin home; PR-gated `main`)
- **Branch(es):** independent per-phase worktrees (land each phase's PR before
  starting the next)
- **Created:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Active <!-- Draft | Active | Blocked | Done -->
- **Vision:** extends
  [`visions/plugins/agent-worktrees`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/README.md)
  (§`external-status-consumer-contract`, §`force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit`,
  §`a-full-health-check-leaves-nothing-stale`, added 2026-09-20 during the
  `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul` effort's Phase 8 design pass) —
  **vision-realizing**: the contract is already written; this effort builds
  the thing it describes.
- **Related:** `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul` (the consumer whose
  Phase 8/Phase 5 are blocked on this work landing) —
  `efforts/active/agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul/README.md`.
  `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md` (the shared pattern this
  effort's daemon is the **second** concrete implementation of, after
  `#2323`'s classify/list accelerator).

## Guiding Intent

Give any external capability — starting with agent-dispatch's Tasks-board
Worktree Status card, but written so it is not the only possible consumer —
a **fast, coalesced, cross-venv-reachable read path** to a worktree's current
status: session/worktree mapping, session lineage + lifecycle event history,
last-known liveness, last-known git state, and the claims graph. Per the
vision's `external-status-consumer-contract`, this is **warmth, not truth**:
the accelerator computes nothing a direct caller couldn't already compute
itself from agent-worktrees' existing primitives — it exists purely so a
render loop or click handler that is itself forbidden from spawning a
subprocess can still get a fast, current answer instead of either blocking or
rendering nothing.

This is **not** new data. Every fact this effort exposes already has an
owning module in agent-worktrees today (`git_ops.classify_worktree`,
`lineage_surfaces.worktree_lineage`, `sessions.scan_sessions_fast` /
`mux_status_many`, `tracking.WorktreeRecord.claims`). This effort's job is
purely the **accelerator plumbing**: bundle those existing computations
behind one coalesced, resident-daemon-backed request per worktree (mirroring
`classify_daemon.py`'s already-landed, already-validated pattern exactly),
and document the wire contract precisely enough that a separate-plugin
consumer can reach it without importing agent-worktrees' Python at all.

## Context

`#2323` (the `plugin-process-hygiene` effort) already built and landed the
**first** concrete instance of the `work-coalescing-singleton` pattern:
`classify_daemon.py` + `work_coalescing_singleton` (vendored, pure-stdlib,
JSON-over-socket) + wiring into `cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records`.
That daemon coalesces concurrent `list --json --classify` batch-classification
passes for the *whole fleet* of one project onto one resident execution.

This effort is the **same pattern, a different fact set, a different key
shape**: not a per-project batch classification, but a **per-worktree status
bundle** — because the Tasks-board card renders one worktree's status at a
time, keyed by worktree id, and because a render loop's per-row cost must
stay small even at fleet scale (a per-project batch pass is too coarse-
grained for "the operator only opened the card for worktree X").

Reference precedent read in full during design (see `Concrete building
blocks` below): `classify_daemon.py`, its wiring into `cmd_status_monitor`
(`__main__.py`, `_classify_records`/`_classify_daemon_compute`), and the
vendored `work_coalescing_singleton` library (`client.py`, `server.py`) —
all in `plugins/agent-worktrees/`.

**Two things this effort does NOT build**, deliberately left to the
consumer's own effort:

1. **agent-dispatch's own client.** `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s
   Phase 8 (and the now-blocked Phase 5) own building the actual cross-venv
   client and wiring it into `board_cli.py`/the Worktree Status card. This
   effort's job ends at: a running daemon, a documented wire contract, and a
   working in-process reference consumer inside agent-worktrees itself that
   proves the design end-to-end.
2. **A new claims-computation model.** The claims graph this effort exposes
   is `tracking.WorktreeRecord.claims`, already durable and already the
   authority per the vision's `Claims, leases, and obligations` concept —
   this effort surfaces it faster, it does not redesign it.

## Concrete building blocks (already exist — this effort assembles, does not reinvent)

| Fact | Existing source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Git state (branch, ahead/behind, dirty, disposition) | `git_ops.classify_worktree()` | ~5 git calls per worktree; the same call `cmd_status`'s fleet loop and the classify daemon already make. |
| Session lineage + lifecycle history | `lineage_surfaces.worktree_lineage()` | Already a **bounded** JSON surface (session nodes, head transitions, handoffs, controller findings, reciprocal relation, graph) — exposed today via the `worktree-lineage` CLI command. Reused as-is. |
| Liveness (mux/Copilot lock) | `sessions.scan_sessions_fast()` / `sessions.mux_status_many()` | Same calls `cmd_status`'s fleet loop already makes per worktree. |
| Claims graph | `tracking.WorktreeRecord.claims` (+ `cmd_claims`'s existing read path) | Durable ledger; already the authority per the vision. |
| Asserted disposition (summary/title/follow-up) | `tracking.WorktreeRecord` (`title`, `resume_count`, disposition fields) + `disposition_history.py` | Already durable; `disposition_history` gives the "arc," not just the latest value. |

None of these need new computation logic. What's missing is: (a) one
coalesced entry point that assembles all five per worktree id, (b) a resident
daemon serving it (mirroring `classify_daemon.py`), and (c) a documented,
cross-venv-reachable wire contract.

## Request

Operator directive (recorded in the `agent-worktrees` vision's Provenance,
2026-09-20): build the accelerator the vision's
`external-status-consumer-contract` describes. Explicit requirements named at
that time:

- Treat the resident daemon as the live "database" for this state: every
  status read funnels through it; its own in-memory state is the current
  authority, best-effort persisted to disk, and should be "complete."
- State to track: worktree/session mapping per repo, session lineage + core
  lifecycle event history, last-known liveness (mux, Copilot lock), last-known
  git state, and the claims graph.
- Fast-cache access for all of the above; force-refresh available but
  **only** at explicit user/agent discretion — never triggered by a normal
  read just to function.
- `doctor` (or an equivalent full health/consistency pass) should leave the
  cache "fully up to date" for every fact it can actually confirm.
- Message/conversation history is explicitly **not** part of this cache — an
  on-demand pull from the owning session host instead (agent-bridge or
  whichever host owns that session).
- "Write the vision for agent-worktrees to reflect this requirement" — done
  in the prior session (see the vision's 2026-09-20 Provenance entries); this
  effort is the follow-through.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Design (this document)
- [x] Confirm the fact bundle, key shape, wire `kind` name, freshness-marker
      shape, and force-refresh mechanism below with the operator before any
      code lands. **Approved 2026-09-20** (see the Journal entry below).

#### Proposed design

**Wire `kind`:** `"worktree_status"` (new, alongside `classify_daemon.py`'s
existing `"classify"` kind, same `CoalescingServer`/`work_coalescing_singleton`
transport — a **second daemon instance** on its own rendezvous fields, not a
shared one with `classify`, since the two have unrelated request shapes and
independent linger/TTL tuning needs).

**Key:** `worktree_status_daemon.coalescing_key(project, worktree_id)` —
length-prefixes `project` (`"<len(project)>:<project>:<worktree_id>"`) so the
split point is unambiguous regardless of either component's own content.
Coalesces concurrent requests for the *same* worktree, but never batches
unrelated worktrees into one compute call (unlike classify's per-project
batch key) — a render loop asking about worktree A must never wait on, or
receive, worktree B's compute. (A plain `"<project>|<worktree_id>"` was the
original design and an early implementation, but round 9's review caught
that it is not injective — neither component is restricted to reject `|`,
so two different `(project, worktree_id)` pairs could collide onto the
identical key. A future cross-venv consumer building its own client against
this wire contract must reproduce the same length-prefixed encoding, not
the pipe-delimited shape.)

**Payload:** `{"project": "<name>", "worktree_id": "<id>"}` — the daemon-side
`compute` callback resolves the record itself from `payload` (never trusts a
caller-serialized record), exactly mirroring `_classify_daemon_compute`'s own
contract.

**Response shape** (draft — refined during Phase 2 implementation):

```jsonc
{
  "worktree_id": "...",
  "project": "...",
  "machine": "...",
  "started_at": 1234567889.0,      // server wall-clock when assembly began
  "as_of": 1234567890.0,           // server wall-clock when this bundle completed
  "facts": {
    "git_state":  {"value": {...}, "confirmed": true,  "observed_at": 1234567890.0},
    "lineage":    {"value": {...}, "confirmed": true,  "observed_at": 1234567889.0},
    "liveness":   {"value": {...}, "confirmed": false, "observed_at": 1234567800.0},
    "claims":     {"value": {"resources": [...], "owner_ref": "..."}, "confirmed": true, "observed_at": 1234567890.0},
    "disposition":{"value": {...}, "confirmed": true,  "observed_at": 1234567890.0}
  }
}
```

Every fact is independently timestamped at its own observation (not the
bundle's start) and wrapped with `confirmed` + `observed_at` — never a single
all-or-nothing "fresh" flag for the whole bundle — per the vision's
`external-status-consumer-contract` (which now explicitly requires preserving
`Derived status`'s per-fact freshness/unconfirmed markers) and
`marked-not-multiplied-uncertainty`. `confirmed: false` means the compute
callback could not confirm that one fact this pass (e.g. a `git_ops` call
failed, or `mux_status_many` timed out for that worktree) — `value` in that
case is the **last durably-known value** where one exists (e.g. from the
tracking record itself), never fabricated, and never simply omitted.

**Force-refresh & the cache layer (revised 2026-09-20 — see Journal):**
`work_coalescing_singleton.CoalescingServer` (the classify_daemon precedent)
has **no persistent cache** — it only deduplicates truly concurrent requests
for the same key; the next call after one completes always recomputes from
scratch. That is sufficient for classify_daemon (subprocess-spawn avoidance
is its whole win) but does not honor the operator's explicit ask: "its own
in-memory state should be the true, current authority... fast-cache
access... force-refresh only at explicit discretion" — which requires a
**genuine cache with real staleness**, not just concurrency-deduplication.

So this daemon adds a layer `classify_daemon` doesn't have: a **durable,
SQLite-backed status cache** (`worktree_status_cache.py`), modeled after the
already-durable pattern this codebase family uses for exactly this shape
(agent-dispatch's own "single-writer, WAL-mode SQLite" store) rather than
`list_cache.py`'s file-sidecar-per-args-shape approach (a good precedent for
TTL/demand-registration *behavior*, but this effort follows the operator's
explicit "lightweight DB tech" steer over file-sidecar for the actual
storage engine):

- **One SQLite file** (WAL mode), one row per `(project, worktree_id)`.
  **As shipped** (Phase 2 implementation, revised from this original design
  sketch to match): a single `bundle_json` column holding the *entire*
  serialized bundle (all five facts, each already wrapped with its own
  `value`/`confirmed`/`observed_at` inside that JSON — see
  `_worktree_status_fact` in `__main__.py`) rather than per-fact SQLite
  columns, plus `computed_at` (when the bundle was last recomputed) and
  `demanded_at` (when a caller last asked about this worktree — the
  demand-registration signal, mirroring `list_cache.py`'s own concept, that
  tells the sweep which worktrees are worth refreshing). One row read/write
  is simpler and sufficient: the per-fact freshness structure already lives
  *inside* the bundle, so a second, column-level split added nothing a
  reader couldn't already get from the JSON itself.
- **In-memory dict is the hot-path read authority** — a request is answered
  from memory, never a live DB read on the request path; SQLite exists
  purely for **durability across a daemon restart** (warm-restore on boot)
  and as the vision's own "best-effort persisted to disk" requirement,
  never as the source a live request blocks on.
- **A background periodic sweep** (its own thread, mirroring the resident
  status-monitor's own sweep-interval convention) refreshes any demanded
  worktree whose cached entry has aged past a TTL — this is what makes an
  ordinary read fast (already-warm) *and* eventually-current without any
  caller ever forcing it, per `continuously-revalidated-freshness`/
  `freshness-is-pursued-not-assumed`.
- **Force-refresh** (`payload["force"]: true`) bypasses the cache's TTL
  check and recomputes immediately — still funneled through
  `CoalescingServer`'s own per-`(kind, key)` coalescing, so concurrent
  force-refresh requests for one worktree still join a single recompute,
  per `force-refresh-is-opt-in-not-implicit`. The in-process reference
  consumer (Phase 4) is the first caller to actually set this flag, from an
  explicit CLI flag — never set implicitly by an ordinary status read.
- A read for a worktree **never before demanded** (cold) computes inline on
  that first request (no sweep has run yet), then registers demand so
  subsequent sweeps keep it warm.

**Rendezvous:** namespaced `worktree_status_*` fields in the same monitor
lock file `classify_daemon.py` already writes into (`worktree_status_transport`,
`worktree_status_endpoint`, `worktree_status_token`,
`worktree_status_generation`) — same pattern as `classify_daemon
.rendezvous_fields`, never colliding with `classify_*`/`hook_*` fields already
there.

**Cross-venv contract (what a separate plugin needs to build a client) —
RESOLVED 2026-09-20, using the standard already-established discovery flow:**
1. Locate the monitor's lock file via the **exact same "standard discover
   flow" precedent that already exists** for a non-`agent_worktrees`-
   importing consumer: `scripts/hook_client.py` (the resident monitor's own
   hook client) resolves the runtime root as `~/.agent-worktrees`
   (`%USERPROFILE%\.agent-worktrees` on Windows) by default, or an
   installation-cell-scoped root when `COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT` is set,
   via the reusable `scripts/registry_root.py` helper
   (`resolve_registry_root`/`resolve_registry_context`, parameterized by
   `_PLUGIN_ID`). This is a **user-global, well-known location** — not a
   dedicated new pointer file — and it is already the exact mechanism a
   script outside `agent_worktrees`' own package uses today. A cross-venv
   consumer either vendors `registry_root.py` verbatim (it already carries
   no dependency on the rest of agent-worktrees' Python) or implements the
   simpler legacy-only fallback (`home/.agent-worktrees`) if it doesn't need
   installation-cell awareness — mirroring `board_cli.py`'s own existing
   stdlib-only precedent for reaching agent-dispatch's coordinator.
2. Read `status-monitor.lock` at that root, and pull the `worktree_status_*`
   fields (transport/endpoint/token/generation) out of it.
3. Speak the `work_coalescing_singleton` wire protocol directly (a documented,
   versioned, pure-JSON-over-socket protocol — no agent-worktrees Python
   import required; `client.py`'s `request()`/`subscribe()`/`release()` are
   ~80 lines of pure stdlib a consumer could vendor or reimplement against
   the documented `PROTOCOL_VERSION`).
4. On any miss (no daemon, unreachable, malformed response), report the
   requested facts as stale/unknown — never block the render/click path,
   per the vision's cross-venv fallback exception.

### Phase 2 — Cache layer + daemon compute callback ✅ DONE 2026-09-20
- [x] Add `worktree_status_cache.py`: SQLite (WAL) schema, an in-memory
      hot-path dict loaded from it on daemon start (warm-restore), a
      demand-registration table/method, and a TTL-aware
      `get_or_refresh(project, worktree_id, *, force, compute)` entry point
      that reads from memory, refreshes via `compute()` when stale/forced/
      cold, and write-through persists to SQLite on every refresh.
- [x] Add `worktree_status_daemon.py` (mirroring `classify_daemon.py`'s
      structure: `start_server`, `rendezvous_fields`,
      `endpoint_from_rendezvous`, a `_with_boot` client helper) — its
      `compute` callback delegates to `worktree_status_cache.get_or_refresh`
      rather than recomputing unconditionally, so `CoalescingServer`'s own
      concurrency-coalescing and this effort's TTL/demand cache compose
      cleanly (coalescing protects one recompute from a concurrency
      stampede; the cache decides *whether* a recompute is needed at all).
      Implemented as `build_cached_compute(cache, assemble)`, wrapping any
      `assemble(project, worktree_id) -> dict` into a `CoalescingServer`-
      shaped callback.
- [x] Add the actual fact-assembly function (`compute` in
      `worktree_status_compute.py`, re-exported as `_worktree_status_compute`
      via `__main__.py`, mirroring `_classify_daemon_compute`'s resolve-from-
      payload contract): resolve the record from `payload`, assemble the
      five facts from the existing building blocks table above, wrap each
      in `{"value", "confirmed", "observed_at"}`. This is the function the
      cache layer's `compute` parameter calls on a miss/TTL-expiry/force.
- [x] A background sweep thread (`worktree_status_daemon.start_sweep_thread`)
      walks the demand-registration table and calls `get_or_refresh` for any
      entry past its TTL, keeping demanded worktrees warm without any caller
      ever waiting on that work.
- [x] Unit tests: coalescing behavior (concurrent requests for the same
      worktree join one compute), per-worktree key isolation (worktree A's
      request never blocks on or returns worktree B's data), a fact that
      fails to compute renders `confirmed: false` with its last-known value
      (never an exception surfacing to the caller, never a fabricated
      value), force-refresh bypassing a fresh cache entry, a stale entry
      triggering an automatic refresh, and warm-restore from the SQLite
      file after a simulated daemon restart. 23 new tests total
      (`test_worktree_status_cache.py`, `test_worktree_status_daemon.py`,
      `test_worktree_status_compute.py`), all passing.

### Phase 3 — Wire into `cmd_status_monitor` ✅ DONE 2026-09-20
- [x] Start `worktree_status_daemon`'s server alongside the existing
      `hook_server`/`classify_server`, publish its rendezvous fields in
      `_lock_extra()`. Starting it must never be fatal to the monitor (same
      `try/except -> None` degrade `classify_server` already uses). Also
      starts the background sweep thread and constructs the
      `WorktreeStatusCache` at `_aw_runtime_home() /
      "worktree-status-cache.sqlite3"` (one host-level file, since the
      monitor serves every project on the host, not just one). Cleanup
      (`finally` block) stops the sweep, closes the server, closes the
      cache's SQLite connection.
- [ ] Confirm `cmd_status_monitor_restart`/the ZDD cutover path carries this
      daemon's generation token the same way it already does for
      `classify_server`/`hook_server` (no orphaned daemon after a monitor
      restart) — **not yet verified**, deferred to this effort's Validation
      Plan pass rather than blocking Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — In-process reference consumer ✅ DONE 2026-09-20
- [x] Wired a **new** `worktree-status-bundle --worktree <worktree-id>`
      command through
      the daemon first, uncoalesced direct-compute as fallback (mirroring
      `_classify_records`'s own `classify_with_boot` → fallback structure
      exactly, via `worktree_status_daemon.status_with_boot`). Added to
      `session_tracking_cli.py` (next to `worktree-lineage`, same
      cross-project `_find_tracking_file`/`_project_for_tracking_file`
      resolution pattern), re-exported and registered in `__main__.py`'s
      `COMMANDS` dict and `_NO_PROJECT_COMMANDS` set (it resolves the
      worktree's project itself, like `worktree-lineage`, so it never
      requires an ambient active project). Ships `--force-refresh`,
      completing Phase 5 in the same change (see below).
- [x] Unit tests (`test_worktree_status_bundle_cli.py`): worktree/project
      resolution failures report a JSON error; the daemon path is used and
      receives the correct payload when reachable; `--force-refresh`
      propagates into the payload's `force` field; a disabled/unreachable
      monitor degrades to the direct-compute fallback (`ensure_monitor is
      None`, confirming the monitor opt-out is honored, not just an
      unreachable-daemon path).

### Phase 5 — Force-refresh CLI surface ✅ DONE 2026-09-20 (landed together with Phase 4)
- [x] `--force-refresh` on `worktree-status-bundle` is the explicit,
      user/agent-discretion-only entry point — confirmed no other code path
      in `cmd_worktree_status_bundle` sets `force` implicitly (it defaults
      `False` and only flips via the explicit CLI flag).

### Phase 6 — Cross-venv wire-contract documentation ✅ DONE 2026-09-20
- [x] Rendezvous-discovery question **resolved 2026-09-20** (operator
      direction: use the standard discover flow, already-established, in a
      user-global location) — see Phase 1's design above:
      `scripts/hook_client.py` + `scripts/registry_root.py`'s existing
      `~/.agent-worktrees` (or installation-cell-resolved) root, no new
      pointer file.
- [x] Documented as a new "Cross-venv consumers" section in
      `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md`, plus a new named
      consumer entry and a "Landed" Sequencing entry for this effort's own
      daemon.
- [x] Handed off explicitly to `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s
      Phase 8/Phase 5: updated that effort's Runbook to point at this
      effort's landed daemon + documented contract.

### Phase 7 — Ground-truth audit + telemetry ✅ DONE 2026-09-21
- [x] `worktree-status-audit` CLI command (`worktree_status_audit.py`):
      reads the durable cache's own SQLite snapshot read-only, samples a
      random rotating subset (cached entries preferred -- real demand --
      falling back to every actively-tracked worktree across every
      registered project when the cache is cold/empty), and diffs each
      sampled entry against a fresh, cache-bypassing recompute via
      `worktree_status_compute.compute` -- the same ground truth a cache
      miss itself would produce.
- [x] Checks: git-state accuracy, liveness accuracy, cache-freshness
      bounds (TTL + sweep interval + slack), identity consistency (a
      cached or freshly-computed bundle's own `project`/`worktree_id`
      fields must agree with the key it's served under), and daemon
      liveness (lock file parses, its owner pid is actually alive, its
      rendezvous fields resolve, and -- given a real worktree to probe
      with -- it actually answers a real request through the daemon, not
      just that stale rendezvous fields are still on disk).
- [x] Appends one JSON telemetry line per run to a local log (default
      `<runtime home>/worktree-status-audit.jsonl`, `--log-path`
      override, `--no-log` to skip) -- a durable trail of the
      accelerator's refresh cadence (`cache_age_seconds`/
      `demand_age_seconds` per entry) and liveness over time, not just a
      single point-in-time read.
- [x] Exit code: nonzero when any mismatch, per-worktree error, or a
      failed daemon probe was found -- scriptable by a scheduled task
      (the operator's own hourly cadence, run via this session's
      `manage_schedule` for now).
- [x] Deployed and validated live 2026-09-21: `agent-worktrees update`
      picked up **dev215** (PR #3147's merge, the version deployed at the
      time -- not this PR's own, which bumps further as Phase 7 itself
      lands) cleanly; `worktree-status-bundle` confirmed working
      end-to-end against a real tracked worktree; `worktree-status-audit`
      confirmed correctly reporting `responsive: false` while the
      resident monitor was cold, then `responsive: true` and zero
      mismatches once it came up -- closing this effort's own "a live
      end-to-end check" Validation Plan item below.

### Bug sweep — linked open bugs (2026-09-24)

_Correlated via a facility-driven sweep of open `bug`-labeled issues against active efforts (VEI + direct review). Not yet triaged into a numbered phase — listed here as upcoming work for whoever picks this effort back up._

- [ ] **#2339** agent-worktrees status-monitor: handoff nudge for one worktree delivered into an unrelated session's mux pane
  - A status-monitor nudge landing in the wrong session's pane is exactly this effort's external-status-consumer scope.

## Validation Plan

- [x] Every phase's own unit tests pass (`plugins/agent-worktrees` suite).
- [x] A live end-to-end check: start `agent-worktrees status-monitor`,
      confirm the new rendezvous fields appear in the lock file, hit the
      daemon with a real worktree id via Phase 4's consumer, confirm a
      coalesced/cached response and a correct fallback when the monitor is
      killed mid-session. (Performed 2026-09-21 via `agent-worktrees
      update` + `worktree-status-bundle` + Phase 7's own audit tool --
      see Phase 7's journal entry.)
- [ ] Concurrent-request coalescing: N simultaneous callers for the same
      worktree id receive one compute's answer (mirroring `#2323`'s own
      `concurrent-callers-during-cold-boot` validation scenario), and a
      different worktree id's concurrent request is never blocked by it.

## Proposal

_Pending operator review of Phase 1's design above._

## Journal

### 2026-09-20 — Kickoff + Phase 1 design drafted
- Effort created following the operator's explicit request ("make a proper
  plan, document it in the effort, get its architecture reviewed, and then
  start building"), per the directive already recorded in the
  `agent-worktrees` vision's 2026-09-20 Provenance entries.
- Read `classify_daemon.py`, its `cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records`
  wiring, and `work_coalescing_singleton`'s wire protocol (`client.py`) in
  full as the reference precedent.
- Surveyed existing agent-worktrees modules for each required fact and found
  **all five already have an owning module** (`git_ops`, `lineage_surfaces`,
  `sessions`, `tracking.WorktreeRecord.claims`, `disposition_history`) — this
  effort's scope is accelerator plumbing only, not new computation, sharply
  narrowing what Phase 2 actually has to build.
- Drafted the wire `kind`/key/payload/response shape and force-refresh
  mechanism above (Phase 1), deliberately per-worktree-keyed (not a
  per-project batch like classify) since the card's own consumption pattern
  is "one worktree at a time."
- Flagged one genuinely open question for Phase 6 rather than assuming an
  answer: how a cross-venv consumer discovers the rendezvous lock file in
  the first place (reads agent-worktrees' existing lock path directly, vs.
  a dedicated smaller pointer file agent-worktrees publishes for exactly
  this purpose).
- **Not yet implemented** — this is the design-review checkpoint the
  operator asked for; Phase 2 starts once the design above is confirmed.

### 2026-09-20 — Design approved; rendezvous-discovery question resolved
- Operator approved Phase 1's design as drafted, with one directive: use the
  standard discover flow already established, in a user-global location —
  not a new mechanism.
- Found the exact existing precedent while resolving this:
  `scripts/hook_client.py` (the resident monitor's own hook client, which
  itself does not import the `agent_worktrees` package) resolves the
  runtime root via `scripts/registry_root.py`'s `resolve_registry_root` —
  `~/.agent-worktrees` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.agent-worktrees`) by default, an
  installation-cell-scoped root when `COPILOT_EXTENSIONS_CONTEXT` is set.
  This closes Phase 6's open question immediately: a cross-venv consumer
  either vendors `registry_root.py` verbatim or implements the simpler
  legacy-only fallback, then reads `status-monitor.lock` at that root — no
  new pointer file needed. Recorded in Phase 1's design and marked Phase 6's
  first item done.
- Phase 2 starts next.

### 2026-09-20 — Design refined: a genuine durable cache, not just coalescing
Started Phase 2 by reading `work_coalescing_singleton/server.py`'s actual
`CoalescingServer.handle_request` in full (not just its docstrings) and found
a real gap: it **only deduplicates concurrent requests for the same key** —
once one compute finishes, the very next call (even microseconds later)
always recomputes from scratch. There is no persistent cache at all in that
component, so "force-refresh" as I'd drafted it in Phase 1 had nothing
meaningful to bypass — every read was already maximally fresh, which doesn't
match the operator's explicit ask ("its own in-memory state should be the
true, current authority... fast-cache access... force-refresh only at
explicit discretion" implies genuine staleness a normal read tolerates and a
forced one doesn't).

Surfaced this gap to the operator rather than silently building something
that wouldn't actually satisfy their stated requirement. Resolved direction:
build a genuine in-daemon cache (not `list_cache.py`'s file-sidecar-per-args
pattern, which is a good behavioral precedent but not the storage engine
wanted here) using SQLite (WAL mode) — the operator's own steer toward
"actual lightweight DB tech that supports durable sidecar-file sync,"
matching agent-dispatch's own already-established "single-writer, WAL-mode
SQLite" convention in this same codebase family. Revised Phase 1's design
(see above) to add `worktree_status_cache.py`: an in-memory hot-path dict
(the true read authority, never blocked on disk I/O) backed by a SQLite file
for durability/warm-restore, a demand-registration table so a background
sweep knows which worktrees to keep warm, and a TTL check the `force`
payload flag explicitly bypasses (still coalesced via `CoalescingServer` so
concurrent force-refreshes for one worktree still join a single recompute).
Phase 2's own Plan items rewritten to build this cache layer alongside the
daemon wrapper and the fact-assembly function.

### 2026-09-20 — Phases 2-3 implemented and landed
- Built `worktree_status_cache.py` (SQLite/WAL-backed, in-memory hot-path
  dict, demand registration, `get_or_refresh`/`sweep_due`) and
  `worktree_status_daemon.py` (`start_server`, `rendezvous_fields`,
  `endpoint_from_rendezvous`, `status_via_daemon`/`status_with_boot` mirroring
  `classify_daemon`'s own client helpers, `build_cached_compute` wiring the
  cache into a `CoalescingServer`-shaped callback, `start_sweep_thread`).
- Added `_worktree_status_compute(project, worktree_id)` in `__main__.py`,
  assembling all five facts from the building-blocks table
  (`git_ops.classify_worktree`, `lineage_surfaces.worktree_lineage`,
  `sessions.verify_worktree_active`, `record.resources`,
  `disposition_history.read` + the record's own disposition fields) — every
  fact independently wrapped via `_worktree_status_fact`, a single fact's
  exception degrading to `confirmed: false` rather than aborting the whole
  bundle or raising past the daemon to every joined caller.
- Wired both into `cmd_status_monitor`: the server starts alongside
  `hook_server`/`classify_server` (same never-fatal `try/except` degrade),
  publishes its own namespaced rendezvous fields, starts the sweep thread,
  and all three are torn down in the existing `finally` cleanup block.
- **Found and fixed a real regression while validating**:
  `test_classify_daemon_started_published_in_lock_and_closed_on_exit` spied
  on `CoalescingServer.close` (the class both `classify_daemon` and this
  effort's daemon import from the same vendored library) expecting exactly
  one close — now there are two `CoalescingServer` instances, so the count
  needed updating to 2, plus new assertions for the `worktree_status_*`
  rendezvous fields. Fixed directly rather than loosening the test.
  Confirmed via `git stash` that a separate failing test
  (`test_monitor_retire_handoff_predecessor_preserves_identity_guard`) is
  pre-existing and unrelated to this change (fails identically with this
  effort's `__main__.py` wiring reverted).
- 23 new tests total across `test_worktree_status_cache.py`/
  `test_worktree_status_daemon.py`/`test_worktree_status_compute.py`, all
  passing; full `test_status_monitor.py` + `test_classify_daemon*.py`
  suites: 93 passed + the one pre-existing unrelated failure noted above.
- `cmd_status_monitor_restart`/ZDD-cutover generation-token carrying for
  this new daemon is **not yet verified** — deferred to the Validation Plan
  pass, not blocking Phase 4.

### 2026-09-20 — Phases 4-5 implemented and landed
- Added `agent-worktrees worktree-status-bundle --worktree <worktree-id>
  [--force-refresh]`: the in-process reference consumer proving the
  accelerator design end-to-end, mirroring `worktree-lineage`'s own
  cross-project
  resolution (`_find_tracking_file` + a new `_project_for_tracking_file`
  reuse) and `_classify_records`'s own daemon-first/direct-compute-fallback
  structure (`worktree_status_daemon.status_with_boot`, honoring the
  resident-monitor opt-out the same way classify's fast path does).
- `--force-refresh` (Phase 5) landed in the same change — the only path
  that sets the daemon payload's `force` flag; confirmed no other code path
  does.
- 5 new tests (`test_worktree_status_bundle_cli.py`): resolution failures,
  daemon-reachable payload shape, force-refresh propagation, and the
  monitor-opted-out fallback path (asserting `ensure_monitor is None`, not
  just "daemon unreachable").
- **Caught and fixed my own editing mistake mid-change**: adding
  `"worktree-status-bundle"` to `_NO_PROJECT_COMMANDS` via a search-replace
  accidentally dropped the adjacent `"conclude-session"` entry from that
  set — caught by re-reading the diff before committing, not by a test
  (no existing test asserts every entry of that set). Fixed before landing.
- Both phases' plan items marked done above.

### 2026-09-20 — Full-suite validation, issue filed, Phase 6 landed
- Ran the full ~4925-test agent-worktrees suite for a final regression
  check. Hit scattered failures starting ~19% in, in files unrelated to
  this effort (`test_execution_leg_cli.py`, `test_ext_reload_warning_
  retirement.py`, others). Confirmed these are **pre-existing full-suite
  ordering fragility, not a regression from this work**: the affected files
  pass cleanly standalone, and the failures reproduce well before this
  effort's own alphabetically-late `test_worktree_status_*.py` files would
  even run in collection order. Filed
  [ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3093](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/3093)
  per the operator's explicit direction ("something will need to tackle it
  holistically") rather than attempting a narrow fix inside this effort.
- Landed Phase 6: added a "Cross-venv consumers" section to
  `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md` documenting the
  `hook_client.py`/`registry_root.py` discovery precedent generically (not
  just for this effort's own daemon), a new named-consumer entry for this
  effort, and a "Landed" Sequencing entry.
- Updated `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s Runbook to point at
  this now-landed daemon and documented contract (see that effort's own
  Journal for the corresponding entry).
- All six planned phases now done. Remaining before calling this effort
  Done: the Validation Plan's live end-to-end check (start a real
  `status-monitor`, hit the daemon with a real worktree id) and confirming
  `cmd_status_monitor_restart`'s ZDD-cutover carries this daemon's
  generation token — both still open, tracked in the Validation Plan below.

### 2026-09-20 — PR opened, rebased over concurrent version bumps, review fixes landed
- Opened PR #3102. `create-pr` hit genuine rebase conflicts against
  `origin/main` (three concurrent version bumps to `1.5.5-dev18x` from
  unrelated PRs merged while this effort was in progress) — resolved
  manually (bump past the highest conflicting version each time, `dev196`
  then `dev197`), no content conflicts in `__main__.py` itself.
- **Copilot review caught four real, fixable issues** — all addressed
  directly rather than dismissed:
  1. **Git-state fallback on failure.** A transient `classify_worktree`
     exception rendered `git_state` as `{"value": None, ...}` even when the
     durable record already carried a last-known state
     (`WorktreeRecord.git_state`). Fixed to fall back to
     `{"state": record.git_state}` when set — the "confirmed: false ...
     best available last-known value" contract wasn't actually being
     honored for this specific failure path. New regression test.
  2. **Sweep-thread shutdown ordering.** `start_sweep_thread`'s return value
     was discarded, so shutdown never waited for it — a sweep mid-`_persist`
     could still write after `cache.close()`, racing a successor monitor's
     own SQLite writer. Fixed: retain the thread handle, `join(timeout=5)`
     before closing the server/cache. New unit test proving the thread
     actually stops promptly after its stop event is set.
  3. **SQLite cross-thread access.** `WorktreeStatusCache` is constructed on
     the monitor's startup thread but read/written from `CoalescingServer`
     request-handler threads and the sweep thread; `sqlite3.connect`'s
     default `check_same_thread=True` would raise on every post-boot write
     — silently swallowed by the existing `except sqlite3.Error: pass` in
     `_persist`, so the daemon *appeared* to work while nothing after boot
     was ever actually durable. Fixed with `check_same_thread=False` (safe:
     every access already serializes through the cache's own `self._lock`).
     New test proves a write from a different thread than construction
     actually reaches disk (verified via a fresh `WorktreeStatusCache`
     instance reading it back).
  4. **CLI syntax mismatch in documentation.** The PR/effort text advertised
     a positional `worktree-status-bundle <id>` invocation, but the actual
     parser (mirroring `worktree-lineage`'s own option-only convention)
     only accepts `--worktree`/`--worktree-id`. Rather than add a positional
     form that would make this command inconsistent with its sibling,
     fixed every occurrence of the incorrect syntax in this README, the
     `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul` handoff note, and
     `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md`.
- 3 new regression tests total for items 1-3 (34 tests now across the four
  `test_worktree_status_*.py` files). Full targeted re-run (cache, daemon,
  compute, CLI, classify_daemon, status_monitor) clean except the same
  confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated failure noted earlier.

### 2026-09-20 — Second review round: 8 more findings, all fixed
Pushed the round-1 fixes; the rebase (needed again, another concurrent
version bump landed on `main` in the interim — resolved the same way,
`dev197` → `dev198`) triggered a fresh Copilot review that caught 8 further
issues, 2 of them HIGH severity. All fixed directly:

1. **HIGH — drain race on monitor shutdown.** `CoalescingServer.close()`
   stops its own accept/reaper threads but does not wait for an
   already-dispatched request-handler thread to finish (no drain primitive
   exists in the vendored library). A handler still mid-compute when
   shutdown reached `cache.close()` could therefore still call into the
   cache afterward. Fixed with an explicit `_closed` flag inside
   `WorktreeStatusCache`, checked by `_open()`: a late call finds the cache
   closed and skips SQLite entirely (still answers in-memory-only) instead
   of reopening/writing through a torn-down connection. New test proves a
   post-`close()` call never reaches disk.
2. **HIGH — path traversal.** `worktree_status_daemon.build_cached_compute`
   only checked `project`/`worktree_id` for non-emptiness, but
   `_worktree_status_compute` uses them to build filesystem paths. A client
   able to read the daemon's rendezvous token could submit a crafted id
   (`../`) to load a YAML outside the selected project's tracking dir.
   Fixed with the same path-safety check `_find_tracking_file` already
   uses (`_is_safe_identity_token`, no `/`/`\`/`..`) before ever dispatching
   the request. New test covering both fields and multiple traversal
   shapes.
3. **Liveness fallback on failure** — the same "confirmed:false ... retain
   the last-known value" contract wasn't honored for the liveness fact
   either (only fixed for `git_state` in round 1): a transient
   `verify_worktree_active` failure now falls back to the record's own
   cached `mux_live`/`bound_live` hints instead of `None`. New test.
4. **`mkdir` `OSError` not caught.** `_connect()`'s `Path.mkdir` call can
   raise `OSError` before ever reaching sqlite3; the original `_open` only
   caught `sqlite3.Error`, so a read-only/unavailable runtime home
   propagated out of the constructor instead of degrading like every other
   durability failure. Fixed; new test.
5. **Non-dict warm-restore rows.** A corrupt/older SQLite row could parse
   to a non-dict JSON value (a list, a scalar); treating it as a real
   bundle would silently and permanently suppress recomputation (the
   fresh-looking entry blocks a refresh forever). Fixed: validate
   `isinstance(bundle, dict)` before inserting into `_entries`. New test.
6. **Synchronous SQLite writes on every fresh-cache read.** The original
   `get_or_refresh` called `_persist` on every read (even a fresh-cache
   hit) just to update the demand timestamp, defeating the "memory-only
   fast read" design goal — SQLite's busy-timeout (up to 2s) could
   serialize otherwise-independent worktrees' requests behind one slow
   disk write. Fixed: a fresh hit updates the in-memory `demanded_at` only;
   only an actual recompute persists (which is what durability exists for
   in the first place).
7. **Sweep race with a concurrent request-driven refresh.** `sweep_due`
   samples then recomputes outside the lock (deliberately, for the same
   reason `get_or_refresh` does); it was previously publishing its result
   unconditionally, so a concurrent request-driven refresh (a miss or an
   explicit force) for the same key finishing first could be silently
   overwritten by the sweep's now-stale answer for a full TTL window.
   Fixed: re-check the entry's `computed_at` hasn't advanced past what was
   sampled before publishing; discard the sweep's result if it has. New
   test simulates the exact race (a refresh callback that itself triggers
   a concurrent force-refresh mid-sweep).
8. **Stale CLI syntax in one more doc.** `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-
   overhaul/README.md` still had one un-fixed `worktree-status-bundle <id>`
   instance (line 125) missed in round 1's sweep. Fixed.
- 6 new regression tests this round (43 total across the four
  `test_worktree_status_*.py` files). Full targeted re-run clean except the
  same confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated failure.

### 2026-09-20 — Third review round: 6 more findings (2 real bugs, 4 stale carryovers)
Pushed round 2's fixes; the next review caught 2 genuinely new issues plus
re-flagged 4 already-addressed-but-stale-context findings:

1. **HIGH — sweep bypassed request-path identity validation.** The
   background sweep calls `_worktree_status_compute` directly (not through
   `build_cached_compute`'s own validation), and warm-restored SQLite rows
   are never re-validated on load — a corrupt/tampered row could carry a
   `../` id and have the sweep read outside the selected project's tracking
   dir. Fixed by factoring the validation into a shared
   `worktree_status_daemon.validated_refresh()` wrapper, used by both
   `build_cached_compute` (the request path) and the sweep's own refresh
   callback in `cmd_status_monitor`'s wiring. New test.
2. **MEDIUM — disposition history read the ambient project, not the
   explicit one.** `disposition_history.read()`/`history_path()` resolved
   the sidecar through `cfg.tracking_dir()` (the ambient active project) —
   but neither the daemon nor the new CLI command ever sets one; a fresh
   monitor process would raise (caught, degrading the whole disposition
   fact to unconfirmed/`None`) or, worse, read another project's history if
   one happened to be ambiently active. Added an explicit `tracking_path`
   parameter to both functions (default preserves the old ambient
   behavior for every other existing caller) and passed it from
   `_worktree_status_compute`. New tests at both the `disposition_history`
   unit level and the `_worktree_status_compute` integration level.
- Also fixed two smaller, genuinely still-present bugs found while
  addressing the above: `get_or_refresh`'s recompute path was stamping
  `computed_at`/`demanded_at` from *before* `compute()` ran rather than
  after completion — a slow git refresh exceeding the TTL could store an
  already-expired result, immediately triggering another refresh on the
  very next read; and `sweep_due`'s expired-entry pop sampled `demanded_at`
  once and then popped unconditionally, so a concurrent refresh extending
  an entry's life between sampling and the pop could have its work deleted
  — both now re-check at the point of the actual mutation, not just at
  sampling time.
- The remaining 4 re-flagged findings (documented CLI syntax, drain
  request handlers, and two already-fixed items appearing as duplicates)
  were stale review context against files that hadn't changed since round
  2's fix — traced the actual source: the **PR description itself** still
  had the old `worktree-status-bundle <id>` syntax (never updated when the
  effort README/docs were fixed), which the review was diffing against.
  Fixed the PR description and added the required Documentation-impact
  statement.
- 4 new regression tests this round (47 total across the four
  `test_worktree_status_*.py` files, plus 1 new `test_disposition_history.py`
  test for the `tracking_path` parameter itself). Fixed two test-authoring
  mistakes caught by re-running immediately: a stubbed `disposition_history
  .read` in `test_worktree_status_compute.py` needed its signature updated
  for the new `tracking_path` kwarg, and a stray orphaned line survived an
  edit in `test_disposition_history.py`. Full targeted re-run clean except
  the same confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated failure.

### 2026-09-20 — Fourth review round: 4 more real findings, plus stale-carryover triage
Pushed round 3's fixes; the next review caught 4 further genuine issues (1
HIGH) and re-flagged 3 already-fixed items as stale carryovers:

1. **HIGH — cross-process cutover overwrite race.** The round-2 `_closed`
   guard only protects one process' own connection; during a ZDD cutover, a
   still-in-flight handler on the *outgoing* monitor could persist a stale
   write to the *same durable SQLite file* after the *successor* monitor
   already wrote something newer. Fixed by making the upsert itself
   monotonic regardless of which process/generation wrote it: `_persist`'s
   `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` now carries a `WHERE excluded.computed_at >
   worktree_status_cache.computed_at` guard, so an older write can never
   overwrite a newer row already on disk. New test writes a "newer" row
   directly, then attempts an "older" write, and asserts the newer one
   survives.
2. **HIGH — `"."` accepted as a safe project identity token.**
   `cfg.project_dir(".")` builds `f".{project}"` = `".."`, so a bare `"."`
   alone (no separators, no literal `".."`) already escapes the intended
   directory — the traversal regex from round 2 didn't catch this exact-
   match case. Fixed by mirroring `lineage_surfaces._safe_identity_token`
   exactly (its own reference implementation already excludes `{".",
   ".."}` alongside separators). New test.
3. **MEDIUM — the monitor's idle-exit never counted status-cache demand.**
   A direct worktree-status consumer (agent-dispatch's own future card, or
   the `worktree-status-bundle` CLI) could keep asking this cache without
   ever touching a live mux session, a Picker project, or `list_cache`
   demand — the three signals the monitor's empty-strikes decision already
   checks. After three empty sweeps the monitor would tear itself (and this
   daemon's own background refresh) down while a real consumer was still
   active. Added `WorktreeStatusCache.has_active_demand()` and wired it
   into both the empty-strikes increment and the retry-before-break check
   in `cmd_status_monitor`, alongside the existing mux/Picker/list_cache
   signals. New test for the method itself (the monitor-loop wiring is
   integration-level, covered by inspection + the existing status-monitor
   suite still passing).
4. **MEDIUM — demand-expired entries were never pruned from durable
   storage.** `sweep_due` (and originally `_warm_restore`) only dropped an
   expired entry from the in-memory dict, never deleted its SQLite row —
   so the demand TTL bounded nothing on disk: every worktree ever viewed
   kept a row forever, and every restart's warm-restore paid to reload
   (then immediately re-drop, after round 3's fixes) all of them. Added
   `_delete_row` and wired it into both `sweep_due`'s expiry path and
   `_warm_restore` (a row already past its demand TTL by restart time is
   pruned rather than rehydrated at all). Two new tests.
5. **Design-doc drift.** The effort's own Phase 1 design sketch still
   described per-fact SQLite columns (`value_json`/`confirmed`/
   `observed_at`); the shipped Phase 2 schema instead stores one
   `bundle_json` blob (the per-fact structure already lives inside that
   JSON) plus `computed_at`/`demanded_at`. Corrected the design section
   above to describe what was actually built, with a note on why the
   simpler shape was sufficient.
6. **Stale carryovers, verified and left alone.** Three findings
   (`worktree-status-bundle <id>` positional syntax in two files, the
   Documentation-impact statement) were re-flagged against content already
   fixed in earlier rounds — verified via direct file inspection that the
   current on-disk content is correct in every case; these are the review
   tool re-surfacing prior-round threads, not new problems.
- 6 new regression tests this round (53 total across the four
  `test_worktree_status_*.py` files). Full targeted re-run (cache, daemon,
  compute, CLI, classify_daemon, status_monitor) clean except the same
  confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated failure.

### 2026-09-20 — Fifth review round: 3 more findings, all fixed
Pushed round 4's fixes; the next review caught 3 further genuine issues:

1. **Missing coordinated `metadata.version` bump.** `AGENTS.md` requires
   bumping `plugin.json`, `pyproject.toml`, and the plugin's
   `marketplace.json` entry for any plugin change — but agent-worktrees
   specifically also requires bumping the marketplace catalog's own
   top-level `metadata.version` field, a separate field from any
   per-plugin version. This was missed across every prior round's version
   bump. Fixed by bumping `metadata.version` to `1.7.7-dev172` alongside
   the usual per-plugin bump.
2. **CLI direct-compute fallback bypassed identity validation.**
   `session_tracking_cli.py`'s `cmd_worktree_status_bundle` falls back to
   calling `_worktree_status_compute` directly when no daemon is
   reachable. Unlike the request path (`build_cached_compute`) and the
   sweep path, this fallback wasn't wrapped in `validated_refresh` — and
   `record.worktree_id` here comes from on-disk YAML content, not
   necessarily the already-validated `args.worktree_id` the CLI was
   invoked with. Fixed by wrapping the fallback with the same
   `validated_refresh` guard used by the other two call sites.
3. **Sweep's durable-row deletion had a race with a concurrent re-persist.**
   `sweep_due`'s expiry-prune sampled a demand-expired entry, then issued
   a plain `DELETE` outside the lock — a concurrent refresh could persist
   a fresh row for the same key in between, and the plain delete would
   wipe it out. Fixed by moving the deletion inside the lock and
   conditioning it on `if_demanded_at` (the sampled `demanded_at` value):
   the delete is now a no-op unless the row's `demanded_at` still matches
   what was sampled. Applied the same guard to `_warm_restore`'s
   startup prune.

Added a regression test per fix: a CLI test that a tampered
`record.worktree_id` is rejected by the fallback path
(`test_direct_fallback_rejects_a_tampered_record_worktree_id`), and a
cache test proving `_delete_row(..., if_demanded_at=...)` is a no-op
against a row a concurrent write has already moved past
(`test_delete_row_never_removes_a_row_re_persisted_after_the_sampled_demanded_at`).
65 total tests across the four `test_worktree_status_*.py` files plus
`test_disposition_history.py`; full targeted re-run (cache, daemon,
compute, CLI, disposition_history, classify_daemon, classify_daemon_wiring,
status_monitor, lineage_surfaces) clean except the same
confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated `test_status_monitor.py` failure.
`check-version-consistency.py` and a fresh `__main__` import both clean;
`check-module-size.py` shows the same pre-existing, non-blocking overage.

### 2026-09-20 — Sixth review round: 4 more real findings, 3 stale carryovers
Pushed round 5's fixes via `push-changes`; the rebase brought in an
unrelated upstream commit that had already split `_worktree_status_compute`
out of `__main__.py` into its own `worktree_status_compute.py` module
(shrinking the module-size overage from ~29,436 to ~29,273 lines -- still
over the grandfathered ceiling, still non-blocking, no action needed) and
had already bumped the per-plugin version surfaces (`plugin.json`,
`pyproject.toml`, the marketplace plugin entry) to `1.5.5-dev200`, ahead of
where this effort's own commits had left them. The next review caught 3
further genuine issues plus 3 stale re-flags:

1. **Per-fact timestamps described the start of the bundle, not each
   fact's own observation.** `now = time.time()` was captured once before
   any probe and reused for every fact's `observed_at` and the bundle's
   `as_of`. Since `git_state`'s probe runs `classify_worktree(fetch=True)`
   (can take seconds), every other fact's `observed_at` -- and the
   returned `as_of` itself -- described when assembly *began*, not when
   each value was actually observed; `as_of` could already be stale by the
   time a caller received it. Fixed by calling `time.time()` fresh at each
   fact's own completion and computing `as_of` after every probe finishes;
   added a new `started_at` field (bundle-assembly start) alongside it so
   a caller can see both endpoints.
2. **The claims fact only exposed the outward ledger, not the inward
   link.** `record.resources` (what a worktree claims) was serialized, but
   `record.owner_ref` (whose claim this worktree itself answers to -- the
   durable *backward* link, e.g. a knowledge worktree paired to a harness
   one) was dropped. The vision's claims contract requires answering
   ownership in both directions, and the existing status surfaces expose
   both. Changed the `claims` fact's `value` from a bare list to
   `{"resources": [...], "owner_ref": ...}`; updated all in-repo
   references (the effort README's own Phase 1 design example) to match.
3. **`_is_safe_identity_token` didn't actually mirror
   `lineage_surfaces._safe_identity_token`.** It rejected `/`, `\`, `..`,
   and a lone `.`, but not an embedded NUL byte -- `lineage_surfaces`'s own
   predicate does. A crafted id like `wt\x00x` passed this guard, then
   `Path`/`tracking.load_record_by_id` raised a `ValueError` past the
   documented fallback -- the daemon request path would drop the socket
   instead of returning its documented error, and the CLI's direct
   fallback would propagate a raw exception instead of degrading. Fixed
   the regex to reject `\x00` too.
4. Three findings ("Add required coordinated version bumps", "Support the
   documented positional command syntax", "Add required Documentation-impact
   statement") were re-flagged against content already correct on disk and
   in the current PR description -- verified directly (`plugin.json`,
   `pyproject.toml`, and the marketplace entry all already at the same
   version the rebase brought in; the PR description already uses
   `--worktree <id>` throughout, never a bare positional form; the PR
   description already carries a "Documentation impact:" statement
   matching the final diff). Same stale-carryover pattern observed in
   round 3 -- the review tool re-surfacing prior threads against text it
   had already flagged once, not new problems.

Added 2 new regression tests
(`test_claims_fact_includes_the_owner_ref_backward_link`,
`test_each_fact_is_timestamped_at_its_own_observation_not_bundle_start`)
plus a NUL-byte case added to the existing path-traversal parametrization
in `test_worktree_status_daemon.py`. 67 total tests across the four
`test_worktree_status_*.py` files plus `test_disposition_history.py`; full
targeted re-run (cache, daemon, compute, CLI, disposition_history,
classify_daemon, classify_daemon_wiring, status_monitor) clean except the
same confirmed-pre-existing, unrelated `test_status_monitor.py` failure.
A fresh `__main__` import is clean.

### 2026-09-21 — Seventh review round: 1 real bug, 3 stale docs, PR metadata drift
Pushed round 6's fixes; the next review caught one genuine bug plus three
doc/metadata staleness issues (no new logic bugs):

1. **`InProcessRuntime.start()` could leak a partial startup on failure.**
   If the cache or server came up but a later step (server start, sweep
   thread start) raised, the handler only cleared `self.server`, leaking an
   open SQLite connection and/or a still-running server/threads -- and a
   still-non-``None`` `self.cache` could keep `has_active_demand()`
   reporting activity, holding the monitor alive on a runtime that no
   longer actually serves. Fixed by calling `self.shutdown()` itself from
   the failure handler (safe against any partial state, since every step
   already null-checks) before clearing all fields to a fresh, fully
   torn-down state.
2. This effort README's header claimed `copilot-extensions` uses
   "direct-push `main`", contradicting the repo's actual PR-gated workflow
   -- fixed to say "PR-gated `main`".
3. The Phase 1 design checkbox was still unchecked with a stale "In
   review" note despite being approved the same day (see the Journal
   entry above) -- checked it off and pointed at the approval.
4. The Phase 2 checklist still described the fact-assembly function as
   living in `__main__.py`; corrected to point at
   `worktree_status_compute.py` (the actual owning module after round 5/6's
   split), noting `__main__.py` only re-exports it.
5. The PR description cited a stale `1.5.5-dev198` version; the actual
   manifests (`plugin.json`, `pyproject.toml`, marketplace entry) publish
   `1.5.5-dev201` -- updated the PR description to match.

### 2026-09-21 — Eighth review round: 2 more real bugs, PR metadata drift again
Pushed round 7's fixes (a rebase over two more merged upstream PRs --
`agent-worktrees: extract namespace CLI from __main__ (#3131)` shrank
`__main__.py`'s actual size further, so the module-size baseline was
re-tightened to the file's new true line count rather than staying at the
prior, now-stale widened value). The next review caught 2 more genuine
issues plus the same PR-metadata staleness pattern:

1. **`has_active_demand()` missed an in-flight cold request.** It only
   consulted `WorktreeStatusCache.has_active_demand()`, which gets an entry
   only once a request *completes* and publishes a result. A fresh cold
   request has a live `CoalescingServer` subscriber the entire time its
   compute is running, with nothing in the cache yet -- so with zero other
   mux/Picker/list activity, the monitor's own empty-strikes idle-shutdown
   could close this runtime (and its cache) while that first compute was
   still in flight, dropping its result. Fixed by also checking
   `CoalescingServer.subscriber_count() > 0` (already tracked by the
   vendored library for its own ref-counted idle-exit) alongside the cache
   check.
2. **The liveness fact was unconditionally `confirmed=True`.**
   `sessions.verify_worktree_active` is itself fail-open (it swallows a mux
   or reclaim probe failure internally and returns a default/partial
   `LiveVerdict` rather than raising), so this fact's own `try/except`
   around the call never actually fired on a degraded probe -- every
   verdict looked fully confirmed regardless. Added a `probes_ok: bool`
   field to `LiveVerdict` (set `False` when either probe swallows an
   exception) and gated the liveness fact's `confirmed` marker on it
   instead of a hardcoded `True`.
3. Same PR-metadata staleness pattern as round 7: the PR description's
   version reference had drifted again (this round's rebase bumped
   `1.5.5-dev201` -> `dev202`) -- updated to match.

Added 2 new regression tests
(`test_liveness_fact_is_unconfirmed_when_verify_worktree_active_degrades`,
`test_in_process_runtime_has_active_demand_counts_a_live_subscriber`).

### 2026-09-21 — Ninth review round: 3 more real bugs, 1 test-coverage gap
Pushed round 8's fixes (guards+lint transiently failed on an unrelated
`agent-index`/payload-invocation test race, confirmed flaky by a clean
re-run of the same commit -- no code change needed). The next review
caught 3 further genuine issues plus one test-coverage gap in round 8's
own fix:

1. **The coalescing key was not injective.** `cmd_worktree_status_bundle`
   built its `CoalescingServer` key as a plain `f"{project}|{worktree_id}"`
   -- but `_is_safe_identity_token` never restricted `|` (only `/`, `\`,
   `..`, NUL matter for the *filesystem* path each component later builds),
   so `("a", "b|c")` and `("a|b", "c")` collided onto the identical key,
   letting two different worktrees' concurrent requests join the same
   in-flight computation and each receive the *other's* bundle. Fixed by
   adding `worktree_status_daemon.coalescing_key(project, worktree_id)`,
   which length-prefixes `project` so the split point is unambiguous
   regardless of either component's content, with no new character
   restriction needed.
2. **`status_via_daemon` (the no-boot helper) sent no `client_id`.** Unlike
   `status_with_boot`, it never registered a subscriber, so round 8's own
   `has_active_demand()` fix couldn't see a request in flight through this
   path either -- the same drop-in-flight-result race round 8 fixed for
   the booting path. Fixed by carrying a per-call `client_id` and releasing
   it in a `finally`, matching `status_with_boot` exactly.
3. **The liveness fact still discarded last-known hints on a degraded
   (not raised) probe.** Round 8 added `LiveVerdict.probes_ok` and gated
   `confirmed` on it, but still serialized the degraded/partial verdict
   itself as the fact's `value` -- since `verify_worktree_active` is
   fail-open, that branch (not the `except`) is what actually reaches the
   transient-failure case, so the record's own last-known `mux_live`/
   `bound_live` hints were never used even though the bundle contract
   requires retaining them here. Fixed by branching on `probes_ok`: only a
   fully-probed verdict is serialized as-is, a degraded one falls back to
   the same last-known-hints helper the `except` branch already used.
4. Added the missing `probes_ok` assertions round 8's own new field
   should have carried into every existing `test_verify_worktree_active.py`
   case (healthy paths assert `True`; the two probe-exception cases assert
   `False`) -- closing the gap where a regression could silently report
   `probes_ok=True` on a degraded probe without any test catching it.

Added 3 new regression tests
(`test_coalescing_key_is_injective_despite_a_pipe_in_either_component`,
`test_status_via_daemon_registers_and_releases_a_client_id`) plus updated
`test_liveness_fact_is_unconfirmed_when_verify_worktree_active_degrades` to
assert the last-known-hints fallback (not the degraded verdict) is what's
actually serialized.

### 2026-09-21 — Tenth review round: 2 more real issues, 1 stale carryover, PR metadata drift
Pushed round 9's fixes. The next review caught 2 genuine issues (1 real
bug, 1 stale doc), 1 confirmed stale-carryover re-flag, and the recurring
PR-metadata drift:

1. **A loaded record's own identity was never checked against the
   requested id.** `_worktree_status_compute` calls
   `tracking.load_record_by_id(worktree_id, ...)`, which resolves purely by
   *filename* (`{worktree_id}.yaml`, already path-traversal-validated) --
   it never checks that the loaded YAML's own `worktree_id` field actually
   matches. A tampered or concurrently-replaced `wt1.yaml` declaring `wt2`
   would produce a bundle labeled `wt1` but assembled from `wt2`'s facts,
   and cache that mixed result under `wt1`'s key. Fixed by rejecting an
   identity mismatch (raising `ValueError`, same as a missing record)
   before assembling any facts.
2. **The effort README's own design section still documented the
   pipe-delimited key round 9 replaced.** Left as-is, a future cross-venv
   consumer building its own client against this documented wire contract
   could recreate the exact collision round 9 fixed. Updated the design
   section to describe `coalescing_key()`'s length-prefixed encoding
   instead.
3. A re-flag that the `test_verify_worktree_active.py` cases don't assert
   `probes_ok` was stale -- round 9 already added that assertion to every
   case (5 healthy-path `True`s, 2 degraded-probe `False`s); verified
   directly against the current file. Same stale-carryover pattern
   observed in rounds 3 and 7.
4. Updated the PR description's version reference again
   (`1.5.5-dev202` -> `dev204`).

Added 1 new regression test
(`test_rejects_a_record_whose_stored_identity_does_not_match_the_filename`).

### 2026-09-21 — Merge race, PR follow-up split, and eleventh review round
PR #3102 was merged at round 8's state while rounds 9-10's fixes were still
in flight (a genuine race between the operator's merge and this session's
next push) -- rounds 9-10's real fixes were recovered from the pre-merge
branch tip and re-derived cleanly onto the merged `main` as a follow-up,
**PR #3147**. That PR's own first review round caught 3 further issues,
2 of them genuine (the third a mechanical artifact of the recovery
process, not a design defect):

1. **The recovery process regressed unrelated marketplace/baseline
   entries.** Reconstructing the rounds-9/10 diff against an older
   snapshot of `main` (taken before the merge) carried forward stale
   version numbers and module-size ceilings for entirely unrelated plugins
   (agent-bridge, agent-codespaces, agent-containers, agent-dispatch,
   agent-index, ai-attribution, context-handoff, customizing-copilot, and
   `agent-worktrees/__main__.py`'s own since-refactored ceiling) that had
   moved forward on `main` in the meantime. Fixed by re-deriving those two
   files fresh from the current `origin/main` and only reapplying
   `agent-worktrees`'s own required version bump on top -- not by hand-
   editing the stale values.
2. **The identity-mismatch guard added in round 10 was bypassed by its own
   caller.** `_worktree_status_compute` rejects a loaded record whose
   `worktree_id` doesn't match the requested id -- but
   `cmd_worktree_status_bundle` substitutes `worktree_id =
   record.worktree_id` *before* calling it, so the check becomes a
   tautology (both sides are the same substituted value). A `wt1.yaml`
   declaring the real, existing identity `wt2` would silently serve `wt2`'s
   facts for a `wt1` request. Fixed by validating the loaded record's
   identity against the actual requested filename (`yaml_path.stem`) in
   the CLI command itself, before any substitution, returning a JSON error
   (consistent with this function's other early-exit checks) rather than
   relying on a guard several calls downstream that this call site itself
   defeats.

Updated the existing tampered-record-id regression test (it previously
asserted a raised `ValueError`, which was really testing the old,
bypassable path -- now asserts the earlier JSON-error rejection) and added
a new regression test proving the *safe, real* mismatched-identity bypass
(`wt1.yaml` declaring `wt2`) is caught too, not just an unsafe/traversal
id the old path-validation guard already rejected.

### 2026-09-21 — Twelfth review round: 1 more real bug, 2 stale carryovers
Pushed round 11's fixes. The next review re-flagged the marketplace/
baseline regression and the CLI-substitution bypass -- both confirmed
already fixed by round 11 (verified directly against the pushed diff: both
files are clean vs `origin/main` except the intended version bump; the
`yaml_path.stem` check is present in `session_tracking_cli.py`) -- stale
carryovers, same pattern as rounds 3, 7, and 10. The review's fourth
finding was genuine:

1. **A fresh-cache hit never re-validated the bundle's own identity
   against its key.** Even with the CLI-level and `compute()`-level
   identity guards in place, `WorktreeStatusCache.get_or_refresh`'s
   fresh-cache-hit path returns whatever is stored under the requested
   `(project, worktree_id)` key unconditionally -- it never checks that
   the bundle's own `project`/`worktree_id` fields actually agree with it.
   A warm-restored SQLite row is never re-validated on load (`_warm_restore`
   only checks it parses as a JSON object), and any bundle persisted by an
   older `compute()` build (before its own identity guard existed) would
   keep being served under the wrong key indefinitely -- never
   recomputing until the next TTL expiry or force-refresh happened to
   coincide with the corruption being noticed. Fixed by treating a cached
   bundle that actively disagrees with its own key (when it carries
   `project`/`worktree_id` fields at all -- this cache is otherwise
   generic, per its own tests) as a miss: evict it (both in-memory and the
   durable row) and fall through to a real recompute.

Added 1 new regression test
(`test_a_cached_bundle_disagreeing_with_its_own_key_forces_a_recompute`).

### 2026-09-21 — Thirteenth review round: 1 more real bug, 3 stale carryovers
Pushed round 12's fix. The review re-flagged the marketplace/baseline
regression, the CLI-substitution bypass, and the cache-identity gap --
all three confirmed already fixed (rounds 11-12; verified directly against
the current diff/files each time) -- the same stale-carryover pattern as
rounds 3, 7, 10, and 12. One genuine issue in round 12's own fix:

1. **The mismatch-eviction delete was unconditional, racing a concurrent
   recompute.** `get_or_refresh`'s new mismatch-eviction path called
   `self._delete_row(project, worktree_id)` with no condition -- if a
   concurrent recompute (the sweep, or a successor monitor mid-cutover)
   published a fresh, correct row for the same key between the in-memory
   eviction and this delete actually running, the delete would remove
   that newer row instead of the stale one it meant to prune. This cache
   already has exactly this race-safety mechanism (`_delete_row`'s
   `if_demanded_at` parameter, added for `sweep_due`'s own identical race
   in an earlier round) -- round 12 just didn't reuse it. Fixed by
   capturing the evicted entry's own sampled `demanded_at` and passing it
   through.

Added 1 new regression test
(`test_mismatch_eviction_deletes_conditioned_on_the_evicted_demanded_at`),
verifying `get_or_refresh` actually passes the conditional guard rather
than an unconditional delete.

### 2026-09-21 — Fourteenth review round: 2 more real issues, 4 stale carryovers
Pushed round 13's fix. The review re-flagged the marketplace/baseline
regression, the CLI-substitution bypass, the cache-identity gap, and the
delete's own unconditional-vs-conditional framing -- all four confirmed
already fixed (rounds 11-13; verified directly). Two genuine issues:

1. **Round 13's conditional delete ran outside the cache lock, itself
   introducing a different race.** `_persist`/`_delete_row` are only
   safe to call while holding `self._lock` -- that's what serializes them
   against `close()`'s own teardown of `self._conn`/`self._closed` (see
   `_persist`'s established call site, always inside the lock). Round 13
   moved the eviction's delete to run *after* releasing the lock,
   reasoning it was I/O like `compute()` -- but `compute()` is the slow,
   expensive git/session work this cache exists to keep off the lock;
   `_delete_row` is the same cheap, already-lock-synchronized operation
   `sweep_due` already runs *inside* the lock for the identical reason.
   Fixed by moving the delete back inside the lock, matching `sweep_due`'s
   own pattern exactly.
2. **PR title/description scope had drifted from the actual diff.** The
   title/description still said "rounds 9-10" after four more rounds (11-
   14) of real fixes landed on top -- reconciled both to describe the
   PR's actual rounds 9-13 scope (this round's own fixes are documented
   here, in the journal, rather than retroactively renumbering the title
   again for round 14 itself).
3. Also caught: the marketplace catalog's `metadata.version` field had
   drifted behind agent-worktrees' own plugin-entry version across rounds
   12-13 (bumped the plugin entry each time but not the catalog-level
   field) -- bumped it to match.

### 2026-09-21 — Deployment confirmed, Phase 7 (audit + telemetry) landed
PR #3147 (rounds 9-14) merged. Ran `agent-worktrees update`: picked up
dev215 cleanly (agent-bridge zero-downtime cutover, all other plugins
updated alongside). `worktree-status-bundle` confirmed working
end-to-end against a real tracked worktree (an unrelated harness project's
own worktree) -- full bundle returned, all facts populated.

Per the operator's request ("ensure it's deployed, audit its
functionality... since everything should be relying on it, it needs to be
accurate"), built Phase 7: `worktree-status-audit`, a new CLI command
that periodically reads the durable cache's own snapshot and diffs a
sample against a fresh, cache-bypassing ground-truth recompute --
git-state accuracy, liveness accuracy, cache-freshness bounds, identity
consistency, and daemon liveness (lock parses, owner pid alive,
rendezvous resolves, and a real probe request actually answers). Appends
one JSON line per run to a local telemetry log (refresh cadence +
liveness trail over time, not just a point-in-time read); nonzero exit on
any finding, meant to be scriptable by a scheduled task.

Validated live: ran the new command against the real deployed runtime
before the daemon had come back up post-update -- correctly reported
`responsive: false` (a true finding, not a bug) -- then re-ran after
`worktree-status-bundle`'s own `ensure_monitor` had booted it, correctly
reporting `responsive: true` and zero mismatches against the one real
cached entry. 34 new unit tests (cache-snapshot reading incl. a corrupt-
row case, sampling incl. cache-vs-fallback preference and sample-size
bounding, each diff/check function, the full `audit_one`/`run_audit`
orchestration incl. a log-write-failure-never-raises case, daemon-
liveness incl. a stale-lock and a real-probe-against-a-real-server case,
and the CLI command's JSON output + exit-code contract).

Scheduling: the operator's own `manage_schedule` runs this hourly for
now (session-scoped -- stops when this session ends); the command itself
is durable and independent of any particular scheduler, so a future OS-
level task or `agent-dispatch schedule` job can drive it identically
without any further code change.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3186 review round 1: a real cross-environment import bug
CI's `worktree-manager (out-of-plugin)` job failed: `worktree_status_audit`
imported `worktree_status_daemon` at module scope, and `__main__.py`
imports `worktree_status_audit` eagerly for its CLI alias -- so any
environment importing `agent_worktrees.__main__` now transitively required
the vendored `work_coalescing_singleton` package at import time, including
the standalone `worktree-manager` package's own test suite, which doesn't
install it. `__main__.py` itself and `session_tracking_cli
.cmd_worktree_status_bundle` both already import `worktree_status_daemon`
lazily (inside the function, not at module scope) for exactly this reason
-- this module just didn't follow that convention. Fixed by moving both
the `worktree_status_daemon` import and its `SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
re-export into the two functions that actually need them
(`check_daemon_liveness`, `_check_freshness`). Verified directly: a
subprocess that blocks `work_coalescing_singleton` at the `builtins
.__import__` level now imports both `worktree_status_audit` and
`__main__` cleanly; added that exact scenario as a regression test
(`test_module_imports_without_work_coalescing_singleton_installed`).

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3186 review round 2: 4 more real issues
Pushed round 1's fix. The next review caught 4 further genuine issues:

1. **The read-only SQLite URI was not Windows-safe.** A plain
   ``f"file:{db_path}?mode=ro"`` is not a valid file URI on Windows (a
   bare drive letter/backslash path) and can also misparse a path with
   spaces -- either could make the audit silently treat a genuinely
   readable cache DB as unreadable, degrading to an empty snapshot.
   Fixed by building the URI via `Path.as_uri()` (percent-encodes,
   normalizes the drive letter/separators correctly on every platform).
2. **`cache_age`/`demand_age` used direct dict indexing.** A malformed or
   older-schema cache row missing `computed_at`/`demanded_at` would raise
   `KeyError` here, violating the module's own "never raises past
   run_audit" contract. Added a `_safe_age` helper that tolerates a
   missing/non-numeric field.
3. **The Phase 7 Validation-Plan checklist bullet's version reference was
   ambiguous.** "Deployed and validated live... picked up dev215" could
   read as describing *this PR's own* deployment (which bumps further as
   Phase 7 lands), when it actually describes the already-merged PR
   #3147's deployment, immediately before Phase 7's own work began.
   Clarified in place.
4. **`--json` was a dead argparse flag.** `action="store_true",
   default=True` can never be `False` -- removed entirely; the command is
   unconditionally JSON-out already, so the flag added nothing.
5. Added the `# noqa: E402` marker `__main__.py`'s own convention already
   uses for its other mid-file re-export imports (see
   `worktree_identity`'s import), for consistency.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3186 review round 3: 2 more real issues, 4 stale carryovers
Pushed round 2's fixes. The review re-flagged the SQLite-URI, unsafe-
indexing, ambiguous-version, and dead-`--json`-flag findings from round
2 -- all four confirmed already fixed (verified directly against the
current file each time), same stale-carryover pattern seen throughout
this effort. Two genuine issues:

1. **`select_sample` could raise on a non-positive `--sample`.**
   `random.sample` raises `ValueError` for a negative count -- a
   misconfigured `--sample -1` would crash the CLI instead of degrading
   to an empty sample, violating the module's own "never raises"
   contract (which this round's finding correctly points out extends to
   a caller-supplied argument, not just internal data shapes). Fixed by
   clamping `sample_size` to `max(0, sample_size)`.
2. **A specific downstream project name in the journal.** The prior
   entry named a real internal project when describing which worktree
   the live validation used -- replaced with a neutral placeholder, since
   this repository is public.

Added 1 new regression test
(`test_select_sample_never_raises_on_a_non_positive_sample_size`).

### 2026-09-21 — post-merge: daemon-liveness redesigned to boot-and-wait like a real caller
After PR #3186 merged and deployed (dev219), an hourly scheduled run of
`worktree-status-audit --sample 15` fired twice and both times reported
`daemon.responsive: false` / `cache_row_count: 0`, with a manual retry
immediately after each firing showing `responsive: true`. Investigated
rather than dismissing the second occurrence as a fluke: the resident
status-monitor's PID and lock `created_at` differed on each check --
confirming the monitor idle-exits between infrequent callers (its own
empty-strike logic, see `cmd_status_monitor`) and only comes back up when
something actually demands it via `ensure_monitor`. The audit's original
`check_daemon_liveness` only ever did a bare, non-booting snapshot read
(parse the lock, check the owner PID, resolve the rendezvous fields) --
exactly the probe that will see this idle-exited resting state and
misreport it as an outage, even though every real caller
(`worktree-status-bundle`'s own fallback path) already tolerates it by
booting the monitor and waiting.

Redesigned `check_daemon_liveness` to route its probe through
`worktree_status_daemon.status_with_boot` -- the same dial/boot/wait/
fallback path every real production caller uses -- instead of the old
bare `status_via_daemon` snapshot. Threaded an `ensure_monitor` callable
through `run_audit` and `cmd_worktree_status_audit`, resolved from
`core._ensure_status_monitor` (only when `core._status_monitor_enabled()`
is true, mirroring `session_tracking_cli.cmd_worktree_status_bundle`'s
own opt-out check exactly -- an operator who's disabled the resident
monitor via `AGENT_WORKTREES_STATUS_MONITOR=0` should never have the
audit spawn one anyway). When no real `(project, worktree_id)` probe
pair exists (empty sample), the check still degrades to the old static
read rather than guessing. Added 2 new regression tests covering the
boot-wait path: one confirming `ensure_monitor` is invoked when nothing
is currently reachable, and one confirming a lock write that lands
*during* the wait window is picked up before the boot-wait limit expires
(not just a before/after snapshot). Updated the 4 existing CLI-level
tests' fake `core` stand-ins to supply `_status_monitor_enabled`/
`_ensure_status_monitor` now that `cmd_worktree_status_audit` always
resolves them.

This is expected to eliminate the two false-positive firings above once
deployed: after this change, `responsive` should reliably read `true`
even when the monitor was resting between callers, because the audit's
own probe now boots and waits for it exactly as a real caller would.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 1: 1 real bug, 1 weak test tightened
1. **A stale (dead-owner) lock would never trigger `ensure_monitor`.**
   `status_with_boot`'s own dial step treats any syntactically parseable
   rendezvous as reachable -- it doesn't check whether the lock's owner
   PID is still alive. Passing `locks.read_lock` straight through as
   `read_lock_data` meant a monitor that crashed without cleaning up its
   own lock file would look "dialable" forever: the probe would keep
   trying (and failing) to reach the dead process and report
   `responsive: false` instead of ever booting a live replacement --
   regressing the `lock_is_live` guard the audit's own non-probe static
   read branch already applies. Fixed by wrapping the reader
   (`_read_live_lock`) to reject a non-live lock owner before it ever
   reaches `status_with_boot`'s dial step, treating a stale lock exactly
   like no lock at all.
2. **The delayed-readiness boot-wait test wrote its lock synchronously.**
   `test_daemon_liveness_ensure_monitor_boot_is_picked_up_within_the_wait`
   had `ensure_monitor` write the lock immediately, before
   `status_with_boot`'s poll loop even ran once -- it would have passed
   even if the poll loop didn't exist at all. Tightened to publish the
   lock from a background thread after a real ~0.3s delay, so the test
   actually exercises the poll loop picking up a lock that lands *during*
   the wait window, not merely before it starts.
3. This PR body's own doc-impact note: no user-facing documentation
   changes are needed -- the only behavior visible to a human is the
   audit's exit code/telemetry now reliably reflecting a real caller's
   own daemon-boot experience instead of a bare snapshot; the effort
   README's journal (this file) is the durable record of that change.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 2: 1 more real bug
The stale-lock dial fix from round 1 was confirmed resolved. One
further genuine issue, in code the round-1 fix hadn't touched:

1. **The post-probe rendezvous snapshot didn't apply the same liveness
   check as the dial step.** After `status_with_boot` returns (having
   correctly rejected a stale lock at dial time and fallen back),
   `check_daemon_liveness` re-read the lock to report
   `lock_present`/`rendezvous_present` -- but that re-read only parsed
   the rendezvous fields, without checking `lock_is_live`. A dead
   monitor's leftover lock (still carrying old, well-formed endpoint
   data) would therefore report `rendezvous_present=True` alongside
   `responsive=False`, contradicting the no-probe static-read branch a
   few lines above, which already gates `rendezvous_present` on
   liveness. Fixed by adding the identical `locks.lock_is_live(data_after)`
   check to the post-probe read.

Added 1 new regression test
(`test_daemon_liveness_stale_lock_with_probe_reports_unresponsive_not_rendezvous`)
covering a stale lock with valid-looking rendezvous fields under a real
probe: confirms `ensure_monitor` is still invoked, and that
`responsive`/`rendezvous_present` land consistently (both false), not
the previous `rendezvous_present=True`/`responsive=False` contradiction.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 3: 1 real gap (version bump), 1 stale carryover
1. **Round 1/2's runtime-payload changes hadn't bumped the version.**
   Each of the two prior commits changed `worktree_status_audit.py`'s
   actual behavior but left `plugin.json`/`pyproject.toml`/
   `marketplace.json` at the version bumped for the original redesign
   commit -- an installed client would treat those fixes as already
   applied and skip the update. Bumped to `1.5.5-dev224` /
   `1.7.7-dev192`.
2. **No CLI-level regression test for the `ensure_monitor` opt-out
   wiring.** `cmd_worktree_status_audit` resolves `ensure_monitor` from
   `core._ensure_status_monitor` only when `core._status_monitor_enabled()`
   is true, but nothing asserted what `run_audit` actually received --
   a regression that always booted (or never did, regardless of the
   opt-out) would still have passed every existing CLI test. Added two
   tests spying on `run_audit`'s `ensure_monitor` kwarg: one confirming
   the real callable is passed through when enabled, one confirming
   `None` when disabled.
3. The "Add regression test for stale lock with live probe" finding was
   re-flagged again this round -- confirmed still a stale carryover (the
   test from round 2 was already present and passing).

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 4: 1 real bug (the original motivating scenario itself), rest stale carryovers
The three "Open" findings this round (version bump, CLI opt-out test,
stale-lock-with-probe test) were all re-flagged stale carryovers,
confirmed already fixed. One genuine "previously missed" finding, and
an important one -- it's the *exact* scenario that started this whole
redesign:

1. **The no-probe path could still fail an audit for an idle-exited
   monitor.** `run_audit` passes `probe=None` whenever its sample is
   empty (an empty cache -- `cache_row_count: 0`, precisely what the two
   original false-positive hourly firings reported). The no-probe
   branch's *success* path already reported the conservative
   `responsive=None` ("nothing to probe with, don't guess"), but every
   one of its *failure* sub-paths (no lock, stale lock, no endpoint)
   still reported `responsive=False` -- and `cmd_worktree_status_audit`
   turns any `responsive=False` into a failing exit code. So the
   original bug this whole PR set out to fix was still fully reachable
   through the empty-sample path, even after the probed path was fixed.
   Fixed by making the no-probe branch always report `responsive=None`
   (never `False`) regardless of outcome -- since there is no real
   request in flight, there is nothing that actually *failed*, only "no
   one to ask" -- while still giving an idle-exited monitor the same
   boot-and-wait chance a real probe would get (via `ensure_monitor`)
   before taking its final snapshot, so `lock_present`/
   `rendezvous_present` still reflect a freshly-booted monitor when one
   is available.

Added 2 new regression tests: one confirming a bare no-lock/no-probe
read now reports `responsive=None` (not `False`), one confirming the
no-probe path also boots-and-waits via `ensure_monitor` when given one.
Updated the two existing no-probe-failure-path tests
(`test_daemon_liveness_no_lock_file`,
`test_daemon_liveness_stale_lock_reports_not_live`) to assert
`responsive is None` instead of the previous (incorrect)
`responsive is False`.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 5: 2 real gaps (test rigor + test speed), rest stale carryovers
All 3 "Open" findings this round (version bump, CLI opt-out test,
stale-lock-with-probe test) were re-flagged stale carryovers again,
confirmed already fixed and passing. Two genuine issues from the
review's own headline text (not itemized as discrete findings, but
real):

1. **The new no-probe boot-wait test never verified the poll loop
   itself.** `test_daemon_liveness_no_probe_boots_and_waits_when_ensure_
   monitor_given` only asserted `ensure_monitor` was called -- it never
   published a lock during the wait window, so it couldn't have told a
   working poll loop from a broken one (same gap the probed-path test
   had already closed in round 1). Added a companion test that
   publishes the lock from a background thread after a real delay and
   asserts the poll loop actually observes it.
2. **Two tests paid an avoidable ~4s wait.** `check_daemon_liveness` had
   no way to override the boot-wait window, so
   `test_daemon_liveness_calls_ensure_monitor_when_nothing_is_reachable`
   (a never-boots probe path) and
   `test_cmd_worktree_status_audit_passes_ensure_monitor_when_enabled`
   (an empty-sample CLI run whose sentinel `ensure_monitor` never
   publishes a lock) each ran the real default `BOOT_WAIT_S` (4.0s) to
   completion. Added a `boot_wait_s` override parameter to
   `check_daemon_liveness` (threaded to both the no-probe poll loop and
   `status_with_boot`'s own `boot_wait_s` kwarg -- a pure testability
   knob, production callers never pass it) and used it (or a stubbed
   `check_daemon_liveness`, for the CLI wiring-only test) to bring both
   down to well under a second. Whole-module test time dropped from
   ~36s to ~24s.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3206 review round 6: 1 more real gap, rest stale carryovers
All 4 "Open" findings from round 5 were re-flagged again this round --
3 confirmed stale carryovers (already fixed), plus 1 genuine miss the
round-5 fix left behind:

1. **The round-2 stale-lock-with-probe test still paid the full 4s
   wait.** `test_daemon_liveness_stale_lock_with_probe_reports_
   unresponsive_not_rendezvous` supplies an `ensure_monitor` that never
   publishes a replacement lock -- round 5's speed pass only touched
   the two tests explicitly named in that review's headline text and
   missed this one, which has the identical shape. Added the same
   `boot_wait_s=0.2` override used everywhere else.

Whole-module test time held at ~22-24s (this test's own 4s was already
counted in the "before" figure from round 5's entry, since it wasn't
fixed until now).

## Follow-ups (not scheduled -- captured for later)

Ideas raised after PR #3206 merged/deployed, during the live-audit
investigation that traced the daemon's ~1.5-3s per-invocation overhead
to per-process import cost (see the 2026-09-21 session's own findings,
not yet written up as a dedicated entry here since no code changed):

1. **Fold `worktree-status-audit` into `worktree-status-bundle` as a
   mode flag** (e.g. `--audit`/`--force`/`--compute`) instead of a
   separate top-level verb, to reduce the CLI's already-large flat
   subcommand surface and the chance an agent guesses at the wrong one
   for a task. Not a trivial one-liner: `--audit` samples *N* random
   worktrees and appends telemetry, while `worktree-status-bundle`
   resolves exactly one worktree via its `--worktree`/`--worktree-id`
   option (no `--project` flag -- it resolves the owning project
   internally) -- a flag here would need to switch the command's entire output shape,
   not just add a knob. Worth scoping as its own small design pass, and
   worth doing alongside a broader look at separating genuinely
   diagnostic/introspection verbs (audit, doctor, hygiene,
   history-digest, ...) from mainline task-driving verbs, so agents
   don't have to guess between them.
2. **An opt-in, elevation-required `agent-machines` module to request
   Windows Defender exclusions** for the runtime install dirs (e.g.
   `~/.agent-worktrees/versions/**`), to eliminate the ~1.5-3s
   per-process AV file-scan overhead observed via profiling (`_io.
   open_code` dominating a `--version` cProfile trace despite a warm
   `__pycache__`). Confirmed on this machine that **Tamper Protection
   is enabled**, which blocks scripted `Add-MpPreference
   -ExclusionPath` changes outright, even elevated -- so this module
   could only fully automate the exclusion on unmanaged personal
   machines; on a Tamper-Protection-enforced (e.g. corporate/EMU) box
   it would need to detect that state and fall back to printing the
   exact path for a human to add through the Windows Security app
   itself. On-demand only, never run as a side effect of anything else.
3. **Duplicate resident status-monitor instances.** Live-observed
   (2026-09-22, sweep-CPU investigation): killing the status-monitor and
   waiting a few seconds repeatedly produced 2-3 simultaneously running
   `agent_worktrees status-monitor` processes, at least one spawned as a
   direct child of another. Whatever guards this daemon's own single-
   instance invariant (the `agent-single-instance-lease` primitive
   exists elsewhere in this codebase) is not preventing this -- needs
   its own dedicated investigation into the status-monitor's own
   spawn/cutover path, not folded into an unrelated fix.
4. **Stale system-Python site-packages contamination.** Live-observed
   on the same machine/investigation: the system Python interpreter
   (distinct from any versioned runtime slot) carries `.pth`-based
   editable installs of `agent-worktrees` and sibling libs pointing at
   *specific, already-finalized temporary worktree checkouts* rather
   than a stable location. A caller that resolves to bare/system
   `python` instead of the properly-resolved versioned interpreter runs
   permanently stale, uncoordinated code that no `agent-worktrees update
   --force` ever reaches. Needs a dedicated cleanup (remove the stray
   `__editable__.*.pth` files) plus tracing which launch path let a
   caller resolve system Python at all, since every documented launch
   path is supposed to resolve solely through the marker-based versioned
   interpreter.

### 2026-09-21 — `_check_freshness` flagged demand-scoped staleness as a sweep bug
A scheduled `worktree-status-audit` run reported a real, growing
`mismatch_count` (1, then 2 across consecutive hourly-style runs) --
distinct from the daemon-liveness pattern already diagnosed and fixed in
PR #3206. Investigated rather than dismissing it as another transient.

Root cause: `_check_freshness`'s bound (`DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS +
SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS + FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS` = 90s) assumed
`WorktreeStatusCache.sweep_due` keeps every cached entry warm
unconditionally. It doesn't: `sweep_due` only refreshes an entry while it
is still *demanded* (`get_or_refresh` registers demand on every read;
nothing re-demands it once no consumer is asking) -- once demand ages
past `DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` (300s), the sweep correctly stops refreshing
that entry (it will be evicted, not endlessly kept warm), and its
`cache_age` grows as an expected consequence, not a malfunction. The
audit's own passive snapshot read never registers new demand either, so
sampling an undemanded worktree only ever observes this expected aging,
never resets it. This is the same class of bug the daemon-liveness
redesign (PR #3206) already fixed once this session: confusing a real
caller's own tolerated resting state for an outage.

Fixed `_check_freshness` to read the entry's own `demanded_at` and skip
the bound check entirely once `now - demanded_at > DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` --
a mismatch is now only raised for an entry that is still within its
demand window (the sweep genuinely should be keeping it warm) but isn't.
An entry with no `demanded_at` at all (an older-schema row) falls back to
the original unconditional check rather than silently passing. Added 2
new regression tests (`test_check_freshness_flags_a_stale_entry_still_
within_its_demand_window`, `test_check_freshness_ok_when_demand_has_
aged_out`); all 45 `worktree_status_audit` tests pass. Bumped
`agent-worktrees` to `1.5.5-dev235` and the marketplace catalog to
`1.7.7-dev203`.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3252 review round 1: the persisted demand timestamp can lag true demand
Copilot's review caught a real gap in the fix above: `_check_freshness`'s
new demand-window check reads the *persisted* `demanded_at`, but
`get_or_refresh`'s fresh-hit path deliberately extends demand only in
memory and never synchronously persists that bump (see that method's own
docstring -- durability of the demand timestamp alone isn't worth
blocking an otherwise memory-only read on SQLite's busy-timeout). The
persisted value only catches up the next time the entry is actually
recomputed (a miss, or the sweep's own TTL-triggered refresh, which
re-persists whatever `demanded_at` is then in memory) -- bounded to
roughly one TTL+sweep cycle, not unbounded, but treating
`DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` as an exact cutoff could still hide a real
stale-entry mismatch for an entry genuinely still demanded in memory
whose last persisted `demanded_at` happens to sit just past that bound.

Fixed by reusing this same check's own `FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS` (already
applied to the `cache_age` bound) on the demand-window check too: an
entry is now only treated as demand-expired once
`now - demanded_at > DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS + FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS`, giving
the persisted timestamp's own lag room to catch up before this check
stops looking. Updated the "demand has aged out" test to sit clearly past
the new, larger threshold, and added a new test
(`test_check_freshness_flags_entry_near_demand_boundary_not_yet_past_
slack`) asserting an entry just past the bare `DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` (but
still within the slack window) is still checked and flagged. All 46
`worktree_status_audit` tests pass. Bumped `agent-worktrees` to
`1.5.5-dev236` and the marketplace catalog to `1.7.7-dev204`.

### 2026-09-21 — PR #3252 review round 2: the round-1 padding reintroduced the original bug
Copilot's review confirmed round 1's fix but caught that it traded one
false positive for another: padding the demand-window cutoff by
`FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS` to tolerate the persisted `demanded_at`'s narrow
lag meant a row genuinely past the cache's own real `DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS`
cutoff -- which the cache has, by design, already stopped sweeping --
would still be checked (and flagged as `cache_freshness_bounds`) for the
whole padding window. That is exactly the "expected resting state
reported as an outage" mistake this fix exists to eliminate, just delayed
and confined to a 60s window instead of removed.

Weighed the two failure modes directly: the round-1 lag is narrow (bounded
to roughly one TTL+sweep cycle, ~30s) and self-correcting (the very next
sweep tick, or the next hourly audit run, observes an updated
`demanded_at` regardless) -- a rare, transient false negative. The
round-2 padding window, by contrast, reproduces the false positive
*every single audit run* for the entire 60s stretch any naturally-idle
row spends aging through it -- a frequent, systematic cost. Reverted to
the cache's own exact `DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` cutoff (no padding), accepting
the narrow round-1 race as the lesser cost rather than reintroducing a
worse, more frequent one. Updated/removed the tests that had asserted the
now-reverted padded behavior; all 45 `worktree_status_audit` tests pass.

### 2026-09-22 — PR #3281: found and fixed the real cause of persistent live `cache_freshness_bounds`/`daemon.responsive: false` findings
The hourly `worktree-status-audit` schedule (running unattended per this
effort's own monitoring plan) surfaced a genuine, recurring finding across
several consecutive runs: `daemon.responsive: false` and 4-6 of 6-7
sampled entries failing `cache_freshness_bounds` (90-175s stale, all
within their demand window) -- worse than the narrow, already-diagnosed
demand-lag race PR #3252 accepted above.

Investigated live rather than assuming another instance of the same lag:
confirmed the resident monitor was alive and TCP-dialable throughout (not
an idle-exit/boot-latency problem at all), then profiled
`worktree_status_compute.compute()` directly against a real tracked
worktree. Found `cfg.load_config()` alone took ~8s of a ~15-40s total
compute, with `_control_plane_related_pr_map()` -- a control-plane
related-index scan this compute path never actually needs (it only reads
`config.default_repo.remote`/`default_branch` for the `fetch=True`
classify call right below it) -- as the dominant, unnecessary cost.
Confirmed safe to skip: that map's result only ever merges into a
per-repo `pr:` overlay (`RepoConfig.pr`), never `remote`/`default_branch`.

Passing `include_control_plane_related_pr=False` dropped total compute to
~5.4s (git fetch is now the only real cost left). Copilot's PR review
caught a second, related bug this surfaced: `REQUEST_DEADLINE_S` (3.0s)
was already tighter than even the *fixed* compute path could reliably
meet, so an on-demand daemon request would still miss the deadline and
fall back every time -- defeating the coalescing/caching layer for any
caller that didn't hit an already-warm sweep entry. Bumped
`REQUEST_DEADLINE_S` to 8.0s (mirroring `classify_daemon`'s own 5.0s,
scaled up for this call's slower single-fetch cost) with headroom above
the measured worst case, rather than trying to force the git fetch itself
below the old 3s bound.

Added a regression test asserting `load_config` is always called with
`include_control_plane_related_pr=False` from this path. Full
`agent-worktrees` suite: 658 passed (10 pre-existing, unrelated
`test_doctor.py` failures reproduced identically with this change
stashed out). Bumped `agent-worktrees` to `1.5.5-dev240`.

No user-facing documentation changes needed -- this is an internal
performance/correctness fix to the accelerator's own compute and timeout
behavior; the wire contract, cache semantics, and every consumer-facing
API are unchanged.

### 2026-09-22 — Sweep thread was saturating a full CPU core; raised DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS and added a per-tick refresh cap
The operator flagged, unprompted, that the resident status-monitor
daemon might be "murdering CPU with unlimited, continuous status
sweeps." Investigated live: found the daemon's Windows process
sustaining ~83-99% CPU continuously for hours, with only 7 demanded
worktrees in the cache.

Root cause: `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS` (20.0) was set when the effort assumed
a cheap ~5-git-call bundle; the accelerator-perf-fix work earlier this
session established the real cost is ~5-6s per compute (the unavoidable
`fetch=True` git call), never re-tuned after that discovery. With N
demanded worktrees each costing ~6s and a 20s TTL, the sweep needs
`N * 6s` of CPU-bound work every 20s window -- already exceeding one
core's capacity at N >= ~4, so the single-threaded sweep loop runs
almost continuously back-to-back rather than mostly idling between
ticks (`SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` is 10s, so it wakes far more often than
it can ever finish its own backlog).

Fixed two ways:
1. Raised `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS` from 20.0 to 180.0 -- live-verified this
   is safe in isolation: `worktree_status_audit.py`'s own freshness
   bound is computed as `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS + SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS +
   FRESHNESS_SLACK_SECONDS`, so it moves with the constant rather than
   being a fixed ceiling this change could violate (confirmed via a live
   audit run showing 0 `cache_freshness_bounds` mismatches at the new
   TTL).
2. Added a `max_refresh_per_sweep` cap (default 4) to `sweep_due()` as
   defense-in-depth: even after the TTL fix, an operator with more
   demanded worktrees than one core can refresh within a TTL window
   would reproduce the same symptom at a higher N. The cap bounds
   worst-case per-tick cost to a fixed number of entries, prioritizing
   the STALEST-ATTEMPTED entries first (see the 2026-09-23 Journal
   entry below -- refined to `_last_attempted`, not bare `computed_at`,
   after a follow-up review round caught that a persistently-failing
   entry's `computed_at` never advances) -- demand beyond capacity
   degrades as wider staleness for the excess entries, served on
   subsequent ticks, rather than unbounded CPU growth with N.

Added two new unit tests (`test_sweep_caps_per_tick_refreshes_
prioritizing_the_stalest_entries`, `test_sweep_does_not_cap_when_due_
entries_are_within_the_limit`) plus the existing 22 `worktree_status_
cache` tests and 45 `worktree_status_audit` tests all still pass (69
total for this targeted run).

**Live verification was significantly confounded by two separate,
pre-existing bugs unrelated to this fix**, both discovered mid-
investigation and captured in this README's own Follow-ups section
below rather than fixed here:
- **Duplicate resident daemon instances.** Killing the daemon and
  waiting a few seconds repeatedly produced 2-3 *simultaneously running*
  `agent_worktrees status-monitor` processes rather than one -- at least
  one spawned as a direct child of another (a self-respawn/cutover path
  spawning a second instance rather than replacing itself), inflating
  observed CPU by however many redundant instances exist regardless of
  any single instance's own sweep tuning. The `agent-single-instance-
  lease` primitive exists in this codebase; whatever guards the
  status-monitor's own single-instance invariant is evidently not
  preventing this.
- **Stale system-Python site-packages contamination.** This machine's
  system Python (`...\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`, distinct
  from any versioned runtime slot) carries `.pth`-based editable installs
  of `agent-worktrees` and several sibling libs pointing directly at
  *specific, temporary worktree checkouts* (some from days earlier,
  long since finalized) rather than a stable location -- meaning any
  caller that ends up invoking bare/system `python` instead of the
  properly-resolved versioned interpreter runs stale, uncoordinated code
  that no `agent-worktrees update --force` ever reaches. Confirmed this
  is pre-existing (the editable-install pointers predate this session)
  and reproducible: several `status-monitor` respawns during this
  investigation resolved through this contaminated path rather than the
  correct versioned slot.

Both are real, live bugs on this operator's machine, but out of scope
for this fix's own object (the sweep tuning itself, which is correct and
independently unit-tested) -- pursuing them fully would have meant
chasing a moving target indefinitely on a busy, shared, concurrently-
updating machine rather than landing a validated, scoped fix.

**Documentation impact:** no user-facing/authoritative documentation
required updating -- `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS`/`max_refresh_per_sweep` are
internal tuning constants with no public contract change (the wire
protocol, cache schema, and every consumer-facing API are unchanged);
this effort's own README (here) is the authoritative record of the
investigation and fix, per this effort's own established convention for
this kind of tuning change (see the 2026-09-22 `REQUEST_DEADLINE_S`
entry above, which took the identical position).

### 2026-09-23 — PR #3348 review: sweep cap could starve on a persistently-failing entry
Copilot's review of the sweep-cap PR caught a real correctness bug the
cap introduced: `computed_at` only advances on a *successful* refresh,
so a chronically-broken worktree (a deleted worktree still tracked, a
persistent git/permissions failure, etc.) would remain "the stalest"
entry on every subsequent sweep tick and monopolize every
`max_refresh_per_sweep` slot forever -- directly contradicting the
cap's own claim (in its docstring) that excess demand is served on
later ticks. In the worst case (`max_refresh_per_sweep=1` and one
permanently-failing entry), every *other* demanded worktree would never
be refreshed again for as long as the daemon runs.

Fixed by tracking a separate `_last_attempted` timestamp, updated on
every sweep attempt regardless of outcome (success or exception), and
using it -- not bare `computed_at` -- for the stalest-first priority
ordering. A failing entry now rotates to the back of the queue exactly
like a succeeding one, so demand beyond capacity is served round-robin
across attempts instead of jamming on one broken worktree. Added
`test_sweep_cap_does_not_let_a_persistently_failing_entry_starve_others`
(cap=1, a permanently-failing entry demanded first, two healthy entries
after -- confirms all three get attempted across three sweep ticks; the
bug would have re-selected the failing entry every single tick).

The same review round also flagged that `worktree_status_audit
._check_freshness`'s fixed freshness bound doesn't account for the new
per-tick refresh cap: once the number of currently-demanded entries
exceeds `max_refresh_per_sweep`, an entry's own turn in the sweep's
round-robin can legitimately take several extra ticks to arrive, so a
fixed bound would false-positive under real load proportional to how
far demand exceeds the cap. Added a `demanded_count` parameter to
`_check_freshness`/`audit_one` (threaded from `run_audit`'s own
`len(cache_rows)`) that widens the bound by
`SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS * ceil(demanded_count / cap)` extra ticks of
slack. Added `test_check_freshness_bound_widens_with_demanded_count_
past_the_sweep_cap` proving the same stale age is flagged at
`demanded_count=1` but tolerated once demand exceeds the cap enough to
explain the delay.

Full targeted run: 71 tests pass (25 `worktree_status_cache` + 46
`worktree_status_audit`).

### 2026-09-23 — PR #3348 review round 3: negative-cap validation, dormant-row inflation, refresh-duration accounting, and unrelated-baseline revert
Another review pass on the same PR caught four more real issues:

1. **Unvalidated negative `max_refresh_per_sweep`.** A negative value
   makes `stalest[:-1]` (a negative Python slice bound) refresh every
   due entry except one -- the CPU-saturation guard this parameter
   exists to provide becomes effectively unbounded as demand grows,
   exactly the failure mode the whole mechanism was added to prevent.
   `WorktreeStatusCache.__init__` now rejects a non-int or negative
   value with `ValueError`; 0 remains a valid (if extreme) "pause all
   sweeping" configuration. Added three tests covering the negative,
   non-int, and zero-boundary cases.
2. **`demanded_count` inflated by dormant rows.** The cap-aware
   freshness bound (added in the prior round) used `len(cache_rows)`
   directly, but that count includes rows whose demand has already
   aged past `DEMAND_TTL_SECONDS` -- `sweep_due` evicts those instead
   of refreshing them, so counting them inflates the bound for every
   genuinely active entry, and enough abandoned rows could let a real
   stuck sweep slip past the audit entirely. Added `_count_actively_
   demanded()`, applied in `run_audit`, and a regression test.
3. **The cap-aware bound ignored each batch's own compute time.** The
   prior round's bound counted only `SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` per extra
   tick, but the daemon's inter-tick sleep only starts once a tick's
   whole batch of up to `max_refresh_per_sweep` entries has finished
   computing (each costing ~5-6s of real git-fetch work) -- with enough
   active entries, a genuinely healthy sweep could still exceed the
   bound before an entry's turn arrives. Added a
   `WORST_CASE_REFRESH_SECONDS` constant and folded
   `WORST_CASE_REFRESH_SECONDS * cap * extra_ticks` into the bound.
4. **Unrelated module-size-baseline widening.** The prior round's
   commit had widened `tracking.py`'s and `worktree-manager/__main__
   .py`'s ceilings to fix red-main growth this PR's own diff never
   touched -- against this repo's own shrink-only baseline policy
   (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), an untouched file's ceiling must never move in
   an unrelated PR. Reverted by taking `tools/module-size-baseline
   .json` verbatim from `origin/main` (which had, by this point in a
   very fast-moving day, already absorbed the same fix upstream) rather
   than hand-editing -- confirms zero unrelated diff remains.

Also bumped the marketplace catalog's own top-level `metadata.version`
(a separate, required surface distinct from the `agent-worktrees`
plugin entry -- flagged as missing) and corrected the Journal's own
description of the cap's priority ordering (it prioritizes
`_last_attempted`, not bare `computed_at`, per the starvation fix two
entries above -- the summary above had drifted out of sync with that
fix).

**Documentation impact:** none of `agent-worktrees`' user-facing
documentation, the wire contract, or the durable cache schema changed
in this round -- purely internal validation, an audit-side bound
correction, and a housekeeping baseline/version fix. This effort README
remains the authoritative record, consistent with every prior entry's
own position on this question.

Full targeted run: 75 tests pass (28 `worktree_status_cache` + 47
`worktree_status_audit`).

### 2026-09-23 — PR #3348 review round 4: heapq.nsmallest for cap selection
Addressed the latest Copilot review round on PR #3348:

- **`sweep_due()`'s cap-selection step** used `sorted(sampled.items(), ...)`
  to find the `max_refresh_per_sweep` stalest-attempted entries, which sorts
  the *entire* sampled set -- O(N log N) once the demanded set exceeds the
  cap. Replaced with `heapq.nsmallest(cap, sampled.items(), key=...)`,
  which is O(N log cap) instead: a real complexity difference once the
  demanded-worktree count grows well past the cap.
- The reviewer separately noted that even with `heapq.nsmallest`, the
  due/expired bookkeeping (the dict comprehensions scanning
  `self._entries` to find what's due at all) is still O(N) in the
  demanded-worktree count, so the "hard CPU ceiling independent of N"
  claim isn't literally true for the *bookkeeping* cost. Reworded
  `DEFAULT_MAX_REFRESH_PER_SWEEP`'s docstring to scope that claim
  precisely: the cap bounds worst-case *recompute* cost (the expensive
  per-entry work this whole cap exists to protect against -- an
  unavoidable ~5-6s `git fetch`) independent of N; the O(N) bookkeeping
  around it is N cheap dict/heap operations, several orders of magnitude
  below one recompute, a different cost class from what the cap actually
  protects against. A persistent priority index would remove even that
  O(N) scan if ever needed at a much larger N than this accelerator
  currently targets -- noted as a possible future improvement, not
  implemented here (same scope-boundary judgment as PR #3348's other
  already-accepted follow-ups).
- The reviewer also flagged the PR description's own Testing section as
  stale (still reporting "two new tests, 69 passing" from the initial
  fix, not the later rounds' 75 passing / 28+47 split). Attempted to
  update the PR body directly (`gh pr edit`); blocked by the same
  Enterprise Managed User GraphQL restriction that already prevents
  posting PR comments from this session (`Unauthorized: As an Enterprise
  Managed User, you cannot access this content`) -- an account/API
  permission limitation, not something fixable from this session. The
  accurate final numbers are recorded here and in this PR's own commit
  history instead.
- Verified: targeted `worktree_status_cache`/`worktree_status_audit` run
  -- 75 passed, no regressions.

No consumer-facing documentation changes needed -- this round is purely an
internal complexity optimization and docstring-precision fix; the wire
contract, cache semantics, and every consumer-facing API are unchanged.
