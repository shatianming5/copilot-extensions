# Declarative Backlog & Review Engine Generalization

- **Slug:** `declarative-dispatch-engine-generalization`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** independent per-slice worktrees
- **Created:** 2026-09-05
- **Status:** Draft
- **Vision:**
  [`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/repository-issue-loop/`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/repository-issue-loop/README.md)
  (declarative-turnkey-adoption, provider-neutral-backlog-capability,
  declarative-worker-identity) and
  [`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/README.md)
  (concise-event-then-charter-pull, preloaded-dispatch-supplement) and
  [`visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/reviewer/`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-dispatch/reviewer/README.md)
  (the open structural-guard question from its Phase 6 in
  `review-automation-reliability`)

## Guiding Intent

Make the declarative recipe engine (reviewer loops and repository-issue-loops
alike) as easy for a colleague on an unfamiliar team to adopt as it is for its
original author, provider-neutral rather than GitHub-only, driven by named
reusable worker identities instead of inlined prompt prose, and cheap to
embody per event instead of paying full instructional cost on every task.

## Context

Live use of the `fabrikam-harness-backlog` repository-issue-loop (validating
the #2056 terminal-reservation fix, see `review-automation-reliability`) and a
same-day conversation about extending the engine surfaced four related,
forward-looking gaps against the newly-extracted repository-issue-loop vision
and the parent agent-dispatch vision:

1. The `ForgeProvider` seam in `repository_issue_loops.py` is already
   provider-agnostic, but `validate_config` hard-gates
   `forge.provider != "github"` -- there is no second adapter, so pointing the
   engine at an Azure DevOps backlog is not yet possible.
2. Adopting a new loop today means authoring a private declaration whose
   `worker_guidance` is a long, hand-written prose blob (see
   `fabrikam-harness-issue-loop.json`, dotfiles) -- there is no library of
   reusable, named worker identities a new adopter can just select.
3. `embody.autopilot_worker_prompt` inlines a large, generic "how to behave as
   an agent-dispatch worker" instructional essay into **every** embodied
   worker's seed, regardless of the actual event that triggered embodiment
   (new work vs. a submitter update vs. a steer answer) or whether the worker
   already knows this material from a prior turn.
4. The reviewer vision's Phase-6 open question (below-altitude prose was
   already explicit and was still violated once) points at the same root
   cause: policy expressed only as prose in a per-repository declaration is
   weaker than policy expressed structurally in a reusable, named identity.

## Request

Generalize the declarative dispatch engine so new adopters can target multiple
forges, select reusable worker identities, and embody cheaper event-scoped
workers without restating the same policy prose in every declaration.

## Plan

### Phase 1 - Azure DevOps backlog provider

- [x] Implement a `ForgeProvider` adapter for Azure DevOps work items
  (list/reserve/claim/release) alongside the existing GitHub implementation.
  Landed `AzureDevOpsProvider` (via the `az` CLI's `devops`/`boards`
  subcommands): WIQL discovery + `az boards work-item show` for fields,
  `System.Tags` as the label equivalent, and reservation markers carried as
  work-item comments through the generic `az devops invoke` REST bridge --
  reusing the existing `_marker`/`_parse_marker`/`_latest_reservations`
  helpers unmodified across both providers.
- [x] Generalize `validate_config`'s hard-coded `"only 'github' is supported"`
  gate to dispatch on the adapter registry instead of a literal string.
  `_SUPPORTED_FORGE_PROVIDERS = {"github", "azure-devops"}`; a new
  `_forge_provider_for(config)` factory selects the adapter class, replacing
  `run_tick`'s hard-coded `GitHubProvider(...)` default.
- [x] Prove one live Azure DevOps-backed declaration end-to-end (discovery,
  batching, reservation, settlement) alongside the existing GitHub declaration
  it must not regress. Proved 2026-09-20 against a real sandbox project
  (reserve/claim/release cycle on real work items, and full discovery once
  the TeamProject-scoping bug below was found and fixed). See the two dated
  journal entries for the seven real bugs this live pass found and fixed --
  only mocked-`az` unit tests had exercised this adapter before.

### Phase 2 - Declarative worker identity

- [x] Define the shape of a reusable, named worker identity (a sub-agent
  definition, in the mold of `proxy-code-review:proxy-reviewer`) that a
  declaration selects instead of inlining `worker_guidance` prose.
  Landed as `agent_dispatch.worker_identities.load_worker_identity`: an
  identity is a `<name>.identity.md` file in the same frontmatter (`name`,
  `description`) plus markdown-body (`rules`) shape as an in-session
  `*.agent.md` sub-agent, resolved repo-local-first then from the plugin's
  packaged `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/identities/`. A declaration's new
  `worker_identity` field is mutually exclusive with inline
  `worker_guidance`; `validate_config` resolves it at validation time.
- [x] Extract at least one existing declaration's inline prose (the
  `fabrikam-harness-backlog` loop is the live candidate) into such an
  identity, proving the declaration shrinks to policy/eligibility only.
  Extracted verbatim into the packaged built-in identity, now shipped from
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/identities/fabrikam-harness-backlog.identity.md`
  (see 2026-09-07 journal entry below for why it moved there).
  The packaging fix landed on `main` via PR #2204. **Now applied to the live
  `dotfiles` declaration** -- switched via a PR in the private operator
  dotfiles repo (not publicly linked here; merged 2026-09-08), gated on
  confirming the installed agent-dispatch slot
  (`0.1.2-dev49`) resolves `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog` first.
  Verified end-to-end post-merge: `repository_issue_loops.validate_config`
  against the merged `origin/main` declaration resolves `worker_guidance`
  from the packaged identity, byte-for-byte identical to
  `worker_identities.load_worker_identity("fabrikam-harness-backlog").rules`.
  > **2026-09-17 correction:** the packaged path this bullet describes no
  > longer exists -- see the dated journal entry below. The live declaration
  > now resolves the same identity from a repo-local override instead.
- [x] Assess whether a named identity's structural boundaries (permitted
  tools/mutations) can enforce the reviewer vision's never-supersede rule
  more robustly than prose alone -- closing the Phase-6 open question in
  `review-automation-reliability`. **Assessed 2026-09-20**: feasible via
  `agent-mcp`'s existing `gate` decorator (preflight-conditional access),
  but not with today's worker-identity schema alone -- see the dated
  journal entry for the full assessment and its recommended follow-up
  shape. Closing this bullet means the assessment is done, not that the
  guard is landed; implementing it is out of scope for this bullet and
  is named as a candidate follow-up, not silently dropped.

### Phase 3 - Concise event-then-charter-pull prompts

- [x] Classify the event shapes a recipe already knows about embodiment time.
  Two shapes already had dedicated concise handling before this effort
  (`bridge.resume_steered_owner` for a steer answer, `supervisor._default_nudge`
  for a stalled-but-live nudge); the remaining gap was the **new-work /
  redrive spawn** path (`embody.autopilot_worker_prompt`), which always
  inlined the full behavioral essay regardless of whether the embodying
  worker would need it again.
- [x] Add the "full charter" command/route a seed points at. Landed
  `agent_dispatch.worker_charter` (one authoritative `autopilot` charter
  text: contract-net evaluation, the goal/progress loop, decline/duplicate/
  complete conventions) plus a new `agent-dispatch charter show <name>` CLI
  command, and a new `concise: bool = False` parameter on
  `embody.autopilot_worker_prompt` -- opt-in, every existing call site
  (`supervisor.py`'s spawn + redrive, `embody.spawn_embodied_worker`)
  unaffected by default. When `concise=True` the seed keeps only the
  task-specific mechanics (show/claim/start/decline/complete commands) and
  points the worker at `agent-dispatch charter show autopilot` to pull the
  policy prose only if it does not already have it this session.
- [x] Measure the token-cost delta. The concise seed is well under half the
  length of the always-inlined one (asserted in
  `test_autopilot_prompt_concise_pulls_charter_instead_of_inlining_it`);
  behavioral fidelity is unchanged since the charter is the same prose,
  fetched on demand instead of always pasted in -- claim/evaluate/complete
  mechanics and decline conventions are identical either way.
  Wired to its first live call site: `supervisor.make_redrive_sender` now
  builds its re-drive seed with `concise=True` -- a re-drive always targets an
  already-embodied worker that already had a chance to read the charter, so
  re-inlining the full essay a second time is pure waste. Every other call
  site (initial spawn, both CLI and headless) is unaffected. New test
  `test_make_redrive_sender_builds_concise_seed` asserts the redrive sender
  builds its seed with `concise=True`.

### Phase 4 - Preloaded dispatch supplement on the worker identity

- [x] Give the shared "how to behave as a dispatch worker" supplement one
  independently-revisable home (`agent_dispatch.worker_charter`) that a seed
  references by a stable name (`autopilot`) instead of re-deriving or
  re-inlining its prose per task. This is the same landing as Phase 3 above
  (they are two views of the same seed redesign, per this effort's own
  Proposal) -- the module is not yet attached *to a named worker identity*
  from Phase 2 specifically (an identity's `rules` are still separate prose);
  that attachment (e.g. an identity frontmatter field naming which charter it
  expects) is still open.
- [ ] Confirm a worker embodied under a named identity never spends a tool
  call or prompt tokens re-deriving this supplement from scratch -- open
  until a live call site actually uses `concise=True` end-to-end.

### Phase 5 - Turnkey colleague adoption

- [x] Write the adoption path for a colleague unfamiliar with the runtime:
  declaration schema reference, the library of available worker identities,
  and a worked example end-to-end (a new repository, its declaration, its
  selected identity). Landed
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/docs/repository-issue-loop-adoption.md`, linked
  from the README, the SKILL, and `repository-issue-loop.md`.
- [x] Identify and remove any remaining step in that path that requires
  reading engine source rather than the declaration schema and an identity's
  own documentation. The one gap the prior slice named -- diagnosing a
  `doctor` failure -- is now closed: added a complete, code-derived
  failure-mode reference table (every one of the 12 possible `diagnoses`
  entries plus `healthy`, cross-checked directly against
  `loop_commands.py`'s diagnosis logic) to the adoption doc's closing
  section, replacing the "read engine source" fallback with a real
  resolution for each. A genuinely novel diagnosis outside that closed set
  is now the only case that should still need source-reading, and the doc
  says to add it there when found rather than normalizing the fallback.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] A new Azure DevOps-backed declaration reaches the same discovery →
  batch → settle outcomes as the existing GitHub-backed one, provider
  differences fully behind the adapter.
- [x] A declaration authored against a named worker identity contains no
  inlined behavioral policy prose, only eligibility/cadence/identity
  selection. Proven live 2026-09-08: the `dotfiles`
  `fabrikam-harness-issue-loop` declaration was switched from inlined
  `worker_guidance` prose to `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog`,
  verified byte-for-byte identical resolved guidance post-merge (see the
  dated journal entry above). This Validation Plan item was left unchecked
  by oversight in earlier legs despite already being satisfied; corrected
  here rather than re-proven.
- [ ] Per-embodiment seed size and token cost drop materially for a
  known-event embodiment versus today's always-inlined prompt, with no
  behavioral regression in claim/evaluate/complete/decline flows.
- [ ] A colleague can stand up a new loop from the declaration schema and an
  existing worker identity alone, without reading engine source.

## Proposal

Sequence Phase 1 (ADO) and Phase 2 (worker identity) independently since
neither blocks the other; land Phase 3/4 (prompt shape) together since the
charter-pull command and the preloaded supplement are two halves of the same
seed redesign; do Phase 5 last so the adoption doc reflects the shape the
other phases actually land in.

## Journal

### 2026-09-05 - Kickoff

- Captured four forward-looking gaps discussed live while reconciling the
  #2056 backlog-loop fix against the newly-extracted repository-issue-loop
  vision: ADO provider support, declarative (named, sub-agent) worker
  identity, concise event-first prompts with on-demand charter pull, and a
  preloaded shared dispatch-behavior supplement on the identity. No
  implementation started; this effort tracks the plan only.

### 2026-09-06 - Reconciled with private-downstream-repo; started Phase 2

- Reconciled the "private-downstream-repo" reviewer-loop concern from the prior
  handoff: the copilot-extensions PR history for the reviewer module
  (`#1445`..`#2134`) is entirely merged under the one operator account, and
  already matches the vision docs this effort builds on. No separate
  unmerged branch or competing identity concept was found; the existing
  `*.agent.md` sub-agent shape (e.g.
  `copilot-extensions-reviewer.agent.md`) is the precedent Phase 2's worker
  identity borrows from.
- Landed Phase 2's identity shape and one extraction: new
  `agent_dispatch.worker_identities` module (`WorkerIdentity`,
  `load_worker_identity`), a new `worker_identity` declaration field on
  `repository-issue-loop` (validated, mutually exclusive with
  `worker_guidance`), and the `fabrikam-harness-backlog` identity extracted
  verbatim from the live dotfiles declaration into
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/identities/fabrikam-harness-backlog.identity.md`.
  10 new tests (`test_worker_identities.py` + 4 cases in
  `test_repository_issue_loops.py`); full existing suite (55 tests) passes
  unchanged.
- Did **not** switch the live `dotfiles` declaration to
  `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog` yet -- the running
  agent-dispatch daemon must have this PR's code deployed first, or it will
  reject the new field as an unknown key and break the live backlog loop.
  That switch is the very next slice once this PR lands and deploys.
- Phase 2's third bullet (structural enforcement of never-supersede) is
  still open -- the identity file today only carries prose rules, no
  enforced tool/mutation boundary; deferred to a follow-up slice.

### 2026-09-06 (cont.) - Landed Phase 1 (Azure DevOps provider)

- Also fixed a pre-existing, unrelated CI-blocking baseline bug found while
  landing Phase 2: `#2167` bumped `agent-index`'s own version without
  updating its shipped agent-dispatch registrar declaration fixture, failing
  the `agent-dispatch` suite's version-consistency assertion for any PR.
  Landed separately as `#2170` (merged) so it didn't get bundled with
  unrelated Phase 2 content.
- Implemented Phase 1's `AzureDevOpsProvider` (list/reserve/claim/release
  over Azure DevOps work items via the `az` CLI), generalized
  `validate_config`'s forge-provider gate to
  `_SUPPORTED_FORGE_PROVIDERS = {"github", "azure-devops"}`, and added a
  `_forge_provider_for(config)` factory replacing `run_tick`'s hard-coded
  `GitHubProvider(...)`. `repo` keeps the same `owner/name`-shaped format for
  both providers (`organization/project` for Azure DevOps satisfies the same
  regex), so no new top-level declaration field was needed. Reused
  `_marker`/`_parse_marker`/`_latest_reservations` unmodified -- Azure
  DevOps work-item comments carry the identical JSON marker convention as
  GitHub issue comments. 17 new tests (identity mismatch, tag round-trip,
  provider-factory selection, malformed-config message update); full
  existing suite passes unchanged.
- Phase 1's third bullet (a live Azure DevOps org/project proving the full
  discovery -> batch -> reserve -> settle path) is still open -- this
  session had no Azure DevOps organization available to validate against;
  today's coverage is mocked-`az` unit tests only. That live proof is the
  next slice for whoever picks this back up, alongside a first real
  `azure-devops`-backed declaration to adopt it.

### 2026-09-07 - Landed Phase 3/4 (charter-pull seed mechanism)

- Landed `agent_dispatch.worker_charter`: one authoritative `autopilot`
  charter (contract-net evaluation, the goal/progress loop, decline/
  duplicate/complete conventions) plus a new `agent-dispatch charter show
  <name>` CLI command that prints it on demand.
- Added `concise: bool = False` to `embody.autopilot_worker_prompt` --
  every existing call site (`supervisor.py` spawn + redrive,
  `embody.spawn_embodied_worker`, `fleet_autopilot_worker_prompt`)
  unaffected by default; `concise=True` builds a much shorter seed (task
  mechanics only) that points the worker at `agent-dispatch charter show
  autopilot` instead of inlining the essay. New tests
  (`test_worker_charter.py`, plus two in `test_embody.py`) assert the
  concise seed is under half the length of the default, still carries the
  task-specific commands, and omits the discursive policy prose; the full
  existing suite (341 tests outside the pre-existing pydantic-missing MCP
  gap and one unrelated pre-existing `test_fleet.py` SSH failure -- both
  reproduced identically on unmodified `main`) passes unchanged.
- **Not yet wired to any live call site's default** -- no call site passes
  `concise=True` yet, so today's live behavior is completely unchanged; the
  next slice is choosing which embodiment events should pass it (the new
  Successor Work roster below) and, per Phase 4's second bullet, attaching a
  charter name to a Phase 2 worker identity rather than hard-coding
  `"autopilot"` in the caller.
- Phase 5 (turnkey colleague adoption docs) still not started.

### 2026-09-07 (cont.) - Wired `concise=True` into the redrive call site

- Landed the first live call site for `concise=True`:
  `supervisor.make_redrive_sender` now builds its re-drive seed with
  `concise=True`. A re-drive always targets a **live, already-embodied**
  worker that never claimed its task -- it already had a chance to read the
  charter the first time it embodied, so re-inlining the whole behavioral
  essay a second time was pure waste. Every other call site (initial CLI
  spawn, headless spawn, fleet spawn) is unaffected -- still `concise=False`
  by default. New test `test_make_redrive_sender_builds_concise_seed`
  (`test_supervisor.py`) asserts the redrive sender passes `concise=True`
  through to `embody.autopilot_worker_prompt`; full targeted suite
  (`test_worker_charter.py`, `test_embody.py`, `test_supervisor.py` -- 231
  tests) passes unchanged otherwise. Bumped agent-dispatch to `0.1.2-dev35`
  across all three version surfaces (`pyproject.toml`, `plugin.json`,
  `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`).
- Attaching a charter name to a Phase 2 worker identity (Phase 4's second
  bullet) is still open -- today's identity `rules` only ever feed
  `worker_guidance` in a repository-issue-loop's *task* prompt
  (`_task_prompt`), which is a different prompt from the *embodiment* seed
  (`autopilot_worker_prompt`) that the charter lives on. Wiring a charter
  name onto an identity would need a new path connecting a dispatched task
  back to the identity that created it (so the supervisor's spawn/redrive
  knows which charter to reference) -- deferred as a larger slice, not
  bundled with this one.
- Confirmed again this leg (unchanged from prior handoffs): the live
  `dotfiles` declaration is still NOT switched to
  `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog`. Unlike prior legs, this time
  the check found the running daemon HAS auto-updated: `agent-dispatch
  --version` -> `0.1.2-dev34` (was `0.1.2-dev29`), and its own venv
  (`%USERPROFILE%\.agent-dispatch\versions\0.1.2-dev34\Scripts\python.exe`)
  successfully imports `agent_dispatch.worker_identities`. The daemon-version
  gate for the dotfiles switch is now clear -- this is the next slice, not a
  re-check. A paired `fabrikam-harness` + `dotfiles` knowledge worktree
  (`owner_user-cloud1-win-20260907-033821-8451` /
  `owner_user-cloud1-win-20260907-033821-8451-k`) already exists, empty and
  unused, ready for whoever picks up the switch (edit
  `dotfiles/.agent-dispatch/registrar/fabrikam-harness-issue-loop.json` from
  its `-k` worktree, never the dotfiles anchor).

### 2026-09-07 (cont.) - Found and fixed a packaging bug blocking the dotfiles switch

- Edited the `-k` dotfiles worktree's live declaration to
  `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog` and validated it against the
  running daemon's own installed code (the local per-user
  `.agent-dispatch\versions\0.1.2-dev34\...\repository_issue_loops.validate_config`
  runtime slot) before actually deploying the change. It failed:
  `RegistrarError: worker_identity 'fabrikam-harness-backlog': no identity
  file found`. Root cause: `worker_identities._BUILTIN_DIR` was computed as
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "identities"`, which only resolves
  correctly in the **editable/dev src layout**
  (`plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/worker_identities.py` ->
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/identities/`). The `identities/` directory lived
  as a **sibling of `src/`**, outside the `agent_dispatch` package, so
  standard `setuptools` package discovery never included it in the built
  wheel at all -- an installed venv (like the live daemon's) has no
  `identities/` directory anywhere under its site-packages, regardless of
  version. This bug was latent since Phase 2 landed (2026-09-06); the
  daemon-version gate masked it because no leg had gotten a clean daemon
  version *and* actually attempted the switch until now.
- Fixed by moving the identity file **inside** the installable package
  (`plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/identities/`), changing
  `_BUILTIN_DIR` to `Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "identities"`, and
  adding `[tool.setuptools.package-data] agent_dispatch =
  ["identities/*.identity.md"]` to `pyproject.toml` so the file actually
  ships in the wheel. Verified by building a wheel
  (`pip wheel . --no-deps`) and inspecting its contents: the `.identity.md`
  file is now present at `agent_dispatch/identities/...` inside the zip
  (it was absent before this fix, confirmed by inspecting an unfixed
  build). Targeted suite (`test_worker_identities.py`,
  `test_repository_issue_loops.py`, `test_worker_charter.py`,
  `test_embody.py`, `test_build_info.py`, `test_supervisor.py`,
  `test_agent_index_managed.py` -- 311 tests) passes unchanged. Bumped
  agent-dispatch to `0.1.2-dev37` across all three version surfaces
  (`pyproject.toml`, `plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`).
- **The dotfiles switch is still blocked** -- now on a *new* daemon-version
  gate: this fix must deploy to the live daemon (a version at or above the
  one carrying this PR) before the `-k` worktree's edited declaration file
  can be copied over to `dotfiles/.agent-dispatch/registrar/...` live,
  because even a `worker_identity`-aware daemon without this packaging fix
  will still fail to resolve the identity file. Re-verify the daemon version
  next leg the same way as this leg did (`agent-dispatch --version` plus
  confirming `agent_dispatch.worker_identities.load_worker_identity(
  "fabrikam-harness-backlog")` actually resolves, not just imports) before
  retrying the switch. Left the edited-but-not-yet-live declaration change
  in the `-k` worktree (`dotfiles.worktrees\...-8451-k`) uncommitted for
  whoever verifies the new gate is clear; do not copy it into the live
  `dotfiles` anchor until then.

### 2026-09-07 (cont.) - Landed the packaging fix; dotfiles switch still gated on daemon rollout

- Addressed two rounds of automated Copilot PR review feedback on PR #2204
  (both were identifier-neutrality nits, not correctness issues): replaced a
  remaining personal `%USERPROFILE%`-style Windows path and a stale
  pre-move `plugins/agent-dispatch/identities/` reference in this README's
  own journal text with neutral wording. A third review round came back
  clean (0 new findings; "Needs a closer look" badge, not a formal
  approval -- this repo's flow profile is `pr-self-merge`, which doesn't
  require a formal "approved" state, just green checks).
- Merged PR #2204 via `pr-merge 2204 --now` and finalized its worktree.
  The packaging fix (built-in identity now ships inside the
  `agent_dispatch` package's wheel; see prior entry for the fix) is now on
  `main`.
- Re-checked the live daemon-version gate per the plan above: `agent-dispatch
  --version` still reports `0.1.2-dev34` (no newer `versions/` directory
  present) -- the daemon has **not yet auto-updated** to a build carrying
  this fix. No manual "pull latest now" subcommand was found on the
  `agent-dispatch` CLI; prior legs observed this daemon auto-update on its
  own cadence (it moved `0.1.2-dev29` -> `0.1.2-dev34` between two earlier
  legs without manual action), so the expectation is it will pick this fix
  up the same way in a future cycle, not that it needs to be forced.
  **Roster item #1 (the actual dotfiles switch) remains not-yet-done** --
  next leg should re-check `agent-dispatch --version` / try resolving
  `fabrikam-harness-backlog` from the daemon's own installed code before
  copying the already-edited `-k` worktree declaration onto the live
  `dotfiles` anchor.

### 2026-09-07 (cont. 2) - Built agent-dispatch live self-update + a public `deploy` verb

- Root cause of the recurring "daemon-version gate" gotcha above: the
  coordinator had no way to notice, on its own, that a newer version had
  been installed -- the only trigger was an external one (a new Copilot CLI
  session's launch-time reconcile, or an operator noticing and restarting
  the service). Investigated `agent-bridge`'s existing `deploy` verb and
  found `agent-dispatch` already vendors the *same* `zdd` zero-downtime
  cutover primitive (`CutoverOrchestrator`, routing table, self-retire) via
  a hidden, installer-only `_cutover` CLI seam -- the missing pieces were
  purely (a) an operator-facing name for it, and (b) live staleness
  detection.
- Added `plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/self_update.py`: a
  fail-safe, fully-injectable `stale_target()` predicate (mirrors
  `self_retire.is_superseded`'s style) that reads the `current-version`
  marker file `versioned_runtime.py` already publishes and resolves the
  interpreter path for that version's slot -- returns `None` (stay put) for
  every ambiguous state (no marker, marker matches running version, or the
  named slot has no installed interpreter yet).
- Wired a new opt-in (`AGENT_DISPATCH_SELF_UPDATE=1`) background loop into
  `coordinator.py`'s lifespan, directly alongside the existing self-retire
  loop: polls `stale_target()`, and once K-confirmed stale at a safe cutover
  point (`DrainGate` reports no in-flight claim), spawns a detached
  self-triggered `agent-dispatch deploy --json` using the *newer* version's
  own interpreter (not `sys.executable`, which would still be the stale
  one). The existing self-retire loop then owns the old coordinator's
  graceful exit once that spawned deploy flips the routing table -- no new
  exit logic needed.
- Added a public `deploy` subcommand in `__main__.py` (same handler as
  `_cutover`, which stays as a hidden back-compat alias): documented,
  non-suppressed help, parity with `agent-bridge deploy`.
- Found `docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-cutover.md`'s binding invariant #1
  ("there is NO externally-driven `deploy` command") is already violated in
  practice by agent-bridge's real `deploy` verb, and is now also violated by
  this change -- added an interim-reality footnote to that invariant plus an
  updated agent-dispatch row in its per-plugin adoption table, rather than
  silently landing a contradiction. The doc's target end-state (fully
  installer-driven, no manual verb) is unchanged; `install.ps1
  -ZeroDowntime` wiring (`zeroDowntimeUpdate` in `plugin.json`) to close that
  gap is flagged as a follow-up, not done this leg.
- Added `test_self_update.py` (11 cases for the pure predicate + marker/slot
  readers), `test_self_update_coordinator.py` (7 cases for the opt-in env-var
  settings parsing), and `test_deploy_cli.py` (3 cases: `deploy`/`_cutover`
  route to the same handler, accept the same flags, and `deploy` is
  documented while `_cutover` stays suppressed). Full targeted suite (470
  tests: coordinator, supervisor x2, self_retire, cli, lifecycle_wiring, plus
  the three new files) passes.
- **Not yet done:** this was NOT exercised against the live daemon this
  leg (too risky to trigger a real self-update against the daemon this very
  session runs on top of) -- it lands via the normal PR flow and will only
  arm once an operator/session opts in with `AGENT_DISPATCH_SELF_UPDATE=1`.
  Once it has soaked, consider flipping the default to on (mirroring
  self-retire's already-validated default-on stance) and closing the
  `install.ps1 -ZeroDowntime` gap noted above.

### 2026-09-07 (cont. 3) - Corrected a stale claim; wired the `-ZeroDowntime` reconciler flag

- The operator asked to continue the `-ZeroDowntime` follow-up and pointedly
  asked "shouldn't ZeroDowntime be the default? No one is going to manually
  request that." Reading `install.ps1`'s actual `Invoke-Update` (and
  `install.sh`'s `_coordinator_cutover`) before touching anything showed the
  operator was right, and more: **the graceful cutover is already the
  unconditional default** on both platforms whenever a live, routed
  coordinator is running (`Invoke-CoordinatorCutover` / `_coordinator_cutover`,
  "Thread B") -- it always cuts over automatically, falling back to
  stop-and-swap only for a pre-Thread-B coordinator or a failed cutover.
  Neither script even has a `-ZeroDowntime`/flag gate on this behavior. My
  own claim in the prior journal entry and in
  `docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-cutover.md` ("`install.ps1 update` itself is
  not yet wired... still does a kill-and-reinstall") was **wrong** -- I had
  inferred it from the doc's own stale per-plugin table instead of reading
  the actual `Invoke-Update`/`_coordinator_cutover` functions first. Corrected
  the doc's agent-dispatch row to reflect this.
- The only genuinely missing piece was narrower than I'd thought: the
  **launch-time reconciler** (`agent_worktrees.reconcile.runtime_installer_argv`)
  only appends `-ZeroDowntime` to the Windows `install.ps1 update` invocation
  when the plugin declares `"zeroDowntimeUpdate": true` in `plugin.json` --
  agent-dispatch's didn't, and `install.ps1` had no such parameter at all (an
  unrecognized switch would have made the reconciler's invocation error).
  Fixed both, mirroring agent-bridge's already-established pattern exactly:
  added a deprecated/no-op `[switch]$ZeroDowntime` parameter to
  `install.ps1` (accepted for backward compatibility, no effect -- the
  cutover already runs unconditionally regardless), and set
  `"zeroDowntimeUpdate": true` in `plugin.json`. `install.sh`'s reconcile path
  never appended the flag in the first place, so POSIX needed no change.
- Validated: `install.ps1` still parses cleanly (`Parser]::ParseFile`, no
  errors), `plugin.json` is valid JSON, and the repo's own
  `check-install-contract.py` / `check-version-consistency.py` /
  `check-docs-consistency.py` all pass. Bumped `agent-dispatch` to
  `0.1.2-dev41` across the three version surfaces.

### 2026-09-08 - Extended "no opt-in" to every agent-* plugin with a real cutover

- The operator broadened the ask: "We want *all* installs from agent-*
  plugins to be zero-downtime, no 'opt-in' business" -- not just
  agent-dispatch. Surveyed all 11 `agent-*` plugins
  (agent-bridge/codespaces/containers/dispatch/index/logger/machines/mcp/ssh/
  vault/worktrees) for (a) whether each runs a persistent daemon at all, and
  (b) for those that do, whether the daemon's install-time update path is
  unconditional, opt-in, or missing entirely.
  - Only agent-bridge, agent-dispatch, agent-index, and agent-vault vendor
    `zdd` / run a persistent daemon with real cutover relevance.
    agent-codespaces/containers/logger/machines/mcp/ssh/worktrees are
    CLI/hook-only or have no installer script at all -- not applicable.
  - **agent-bridge** and **agent-dispatch** were already unconditional
    (confirmed again by reading `Invoke-Update` directly) -- no work needed
    beyond the doc corrections below.
  - **agent-index** *looked* partial per the pattern doc, but reading its
    actual `Invoke-ServiceCutover` showed the service cutover is **already
    unconditional** too (`agent_index deploy` runs automatically whenever a
    live, healthy service is running) -- it was just missing the same
    `"zeroDowntimeUpdate": true` + back-compat `-ZeroDowntime` switch wiring
    agent-dispatch got last leg. Fixed identically: added the plugin.json
    flag and a deprecated no-op `[switch]$ZeroDowntime` param to its
    `install.ps1`. Bumped `agent-index` to `0.1.0-dev147` across all four
    version surfaces (plugin.json, pyproject.toml, marketplace.json, **and**
    `src/agent_index/__init__.py`'s hardcoded fallback `__version__` --
    agent-index has one more version surface than agent-dispatch does).
  - **agent-vault** genuinely has **no** zdd-based cutover yet (its update is
    a cooperative stop/drain/restart with credential-cache-based reconnect,
    not an active/passive routing flip) -- this is not an "opt-in flag to
    remove" situation, it is a real feature gap already tracked in the
    pattern doc's own per-plugin table ("Lightest tier" work item). Left
    untouched this leg: it is a bigger, security-sensitive lift (touches the
    unlocked-credential-session handoff) that deserves its own dedicated
    slice rather than being rushed in alongside a flag-wiring pass.
  - **agent-mcp** has `zdd` adopted for a manually-triggered `cutover` verb
    but has no install/activation script of its own yet to wire it into
    (per the doc's own existing "Work" note) -- also out of scope here for
    the same reason (no installer path exists to make unconditional).
  - Corrected two more stale doc claims in the process (in addition to the
    agent-dispatch one from last leg): the per-plugin table's agent-bridge
    row still described `-ZeroDowntime` as an install-path opt-in and
    "installer-driven" as future work, when `Invoke-Update` already runs it
    unconditionally; the agent-index row said the same. Rewrote both rows,
    and rewrote the Invariants section's "interim reality" footnote (which
    only mentioned agent-bridge + agent-dispatch, and repeated the
    now-corrected claim that agent-bridge's path "is not yet fully
    installer-driven") to name all three plugins and explain why each still
    keeps a public `deploy` verb despite its install path already being
    fully automatic (manual escape hatch; for agent-dispatch, also the
    self-update loop's spawn target).
- Validated: `install.ps1` parses cleanly, `plugin.json` is valid JSON, and
  `check-install-contract.py` / `check-version-consistency.py` /
  `check-docs-consistency.py` all pass.

### 2026-09-08 (cont.) - Production incident: duplicate coordinator/supervisor tree under the wrong interpreter

- Live incident on this machine: 116+ `conhost.exe` processes, traced to a
  full **duplicate** coordinator + supervisor + emitter process tree running
  under the machine's system-wide Python install
  (`AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`) alongside the
  correct tree running under the installed versioned-runtime slot
  (`~\.agent-dispatch\versions\<current>\Scripts\python.exe`) -- every
  supervised lane and emitter doubled, each pair spawned within the same
  second.
- Mitigated immediately: identified which of each duplicate pair actually
  held the live listening port (`Get-NetTCPConnection` cross-referenced
  against `running-version.json`), killed only the inert losers, restarted
  the `agent-dispatch`/`agent-dispatch-supervisor` Scheduled Tasks, confirmed
  `agent-dispatch health` recovered.
- Root-caused the underlying class of bug (not fully pinned to a single
  reproducible trigger, but conclusively identified and closed every known
  spawn site of this shape): several places in `agent_dispatch` spawn a
  **new copy of a long-lived daemon component** (a coordinator, a supervisor,
  or a registration child) using either a stale hard-coded legacy `.venv`
  path or a bare `sys.executable` as the interpreter -- neither is guaranteed
  to match the canonically-resolved current-version slot the binstubs and
  service launchers actually use, and because a detached child inherits
  whatever its parent resolved, a single wrong resolution silently
  compounds into a full duplicate tree.
- Fix: added `agent_dispatch.procutil.resolve_own_runtime_python()` -- a
  thin wrapper over the plugin's own already-existing
  `resolve_runtime_python()` (the same three-tier current-version-marker
  resolver the binstubs/`versioned_runtime.py` use), falling back to
  `sys.executable` only when no runtime is installed at all (dev/test).
  Replaced every self-relaunch spawn site with it:
  - `_spawn_coordinator_process()`: removed the stale legacy `.venv`
    existence check + `sys.executable` fallback entirely.
  - `_spawn_supervisor_daemon_detached()`: replaced its bare
    `sys.executable`.
  - `SupervisorDaemon`: resolves its own canonical interpreter **once**
    (cached, since the slot cannot change without a daemon restart anyway)
    and passes it explicitly to every `build_command(reg, python=...)` call
    for a registration child, instead of relying on `build_command`'s own
    `sys.executable` default.
  - Left `_cmd_cutover`'s passive-spawn (`_sys.executable`) and
    `_spawn_detached_waiter`'s re-exec (`sys.executable`) unchanged --
    both are deliberately "continue running under THIS SAME interpreter"
    cases (the self-update loop already resolves the *target* version's own
    interpreter before invoking `deploy`; a detached `run --detach` waiter
    is meant to literally continue the current invocation), not
    self-relaunch-under-the-canonical-slot cases.
- Added regression tests: `test_procutil.py` (`resolve_own_runtime_python`
  resolves the installed slot over a stale legacy `.venv`, and degrades to
  `sys.executable` when nothing is installed), `test_lazy_start.py` and
  `test_registrations.py` (the coordinator's and supervisor's own spawn
  sites resolve the canonical slot, not `sys.executable`, even with a stale
  legacy `.venv` present), `test_supervisor_daemon.py` (a registration
  child is spawned via the daemon's own resolved interpreter; the
  resolution is cached, not repeated every reconcile tick).
- Bumped `agent-dispatch` to `0.1.2-dev51`. Full targeted suite plus the
  complete plugin suite (2217 tests) pass; the only failure is the
  pre-existing, unrelated `test_fleet.py::test_spawn_fleet_headless_worker_
  builds_ssh_agent_bridge_argv` (confirmed failing identically on `main`
  without this change).
- **Not fully closed:** despite closing every known spawn site of this
  *shape*, the exact trigger for the ORIGINAL incident's very-first
  duplicate pair (a live coordinator/supervisor tree that was ALREADY
  running correctly under its versioned slot, yet still had a full wrong-
  interpreter twin) was not conclusively reproduced in isolation -- direct
  `subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, ...])` from the dev49 slot correctly
  spawns dev49 children, so the precise moment/mechanism that first
  produced a Python312 sibling for an already-correctly-running dev49
  process remains unconfirmed. The fix closes the entire known class
  (every self-relaunch site in this plugin's own code now resolves
  canonically, never trusts `sys.executable`/a legacy path), which is
  sufficient to prevent recurrence regardless of the unconfirmed original
  trigger; flagging for anyone who sees this pattern again to capture a
  process-creation ETW trace (`Get-CimInstance -ClassName
  Win32_ProcessStartTrace` or Sysinternals Process Monitor) at the moment
  of the NEXT occurrence, since after-the-fact WMI snapshots proved
  insufficient to pin the exact call site with certainty.
- Sibling plugins (agent-bridge, agent-index, agent-mcp, agent-vault, etc.)
  were **not** audited for the same anti-pattern this leg -- flagged as a
  worthwhile follow-up given each vendors its own `procutil.py` copy with
  the same `resolve_runtime_python()` primitive already available.

### 2026-09-08 (cont. 2) - Switched the live `dotfiles` declaration to `worker_identity`

- Re-verified the daemon-version gate before touching the live declaration:
  the currently installed/running agent-dispatch slot is `0.1.2-dev49`
  (confirmed via `agent-dispatch health`), and
  `worker_identities.load_worker_identity("fabrikam-harness-backlog")`
  resolves cleanly against that slot's installed package (packaged identity
  path under `...\0.1.2-dev49\Lib\site-packages\agent_dispatch\identities\`)
  -- the packaging fix from PR #2204 is present, so this switch is safe.
- Applied the previously-staged edit (from the prior handoff leg) to
  `dotfiles`'s `.agent-dispatch/registrar/fabrikam-harness-issue-loop.json`:
  replaced the inlined `worker_guidance` prose with
  `"worker_identity": "fabrikam-harness-backlog"`. Landed via a PR in the
  private operator dotfiles repo (self-merged, squash), worktree
  finalized.
- Verified end-to-end post-merge (not just pre-merge): fetched
  `origin/main`'s merged declaration content and ran
  `repository_issue_loops.validate_config` against it directly -- it
  resolves `worker_identity` into `worker_guidance`, and the resolved value
  is byte-for-byte identical to
  `worker_identities.load_worker_identity("fabrikam-harness-backlog").rules`.
  `registrar discover`/`registrar doctor` against the merged content also
  show no errors. Phase 2's second bullet is now fully closed.
- Also filed an issue in a private consuming-harness repo (unrelated, not
  named here): the
  mux window that resumed this handoff spawned multiple Copilot sessions
  racing to claim the same `context-handoff` task; only one won via the
  exactly-once claim. No data corruption, but the duplicate spawn itself is
  a harness bug worth a follow-up fix.

### 2026-09-17 - Correction: the packaged identity referenced by earlier legs is gone

The prior entries above (2026-09-08 legs) recorded the identity this effort
wired up (`worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog`) as **packaged** --
resolved from this repo's own built-in identities tier. That is no longer
accurate: `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2851` (fixed in
`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2854`) found that identity should never have
shipped as a package built-in -- its content (a repo name, skill paths,
labels, commands) was all specific to the adopting repository that first
authored it, which is adopter-private content, not generic package content.

#2854 removes that identity file from this package's built-in tier and
replaces it with a generic default identity. The live registrar declaration
this effort wired up above keeps working unchanged, because the adopting
repository independently added the removed content as its own repo-local
override -- tier 1 of the worker-identity resolution order, which the live
declaration always preferred over the built-in tier when run with that
repo's checkout as `cwd`. Any reader relying on the 2026-09-08 entries'
description of the packaged path should treat this entry as the current
state instead.

### 2026-09-20 - Proved the Azure DevOps provider live; found and fixed six real bugs

- Prior status check this same day surfaced that the dotfiles-switch item
  from the prior handoff was stale (already done 2026-09-08, and the
  declaration it applied to was independently retired 9/15 in favor of a new
  `effort-lane` system -- unrelated to this effort, no action needed). With
  that cleared, picked up the effort's other open item: proving Phase 1's
  Azure DevOps adapter against a real org (never exercised live before,
  only mocked `az` unit tests).
- Ran the adapter against a real sandbox project (`SPO Project Outcomes` /
  `onedrive.visualstudio.com`, throwaway work items, all deleted after).
  Found and fixed six real bugs the mocks could not have caught:
  1. `_verify_identity`'s `az devops invoke --area connectionData --resource
     connectionData` always fails against a real org --
     `connectionData`/`ConnectionData` is not a project-collection resource
     area (confirmed absent from `_apis/resourceareas`); it is a
     deployment/VSSPS-level endpoint. Fixed by calling
     `{org_url}/_apis/connectionData` directly via `az rest` instead.
  2. `_az` passed `"az"` straight to `subprocess.run` with no shell and no
     `PATHEXT` resolution -- fails with `FileNotFoundError` on any Windows
     host where Azure CLI installs as `az.cmd` (confirmed: `gh` ships a real
     `.exe` and has no such problem, so the GitHub adapter never hit this).
     Fixed with `shutil.which("az") or "az"`.
  3. The `wit/comments` GET call in both `list_open_issues` and `release`
     omitted `--api-version`, which crashes with an unhandled CLI-internal
     `TypeError` (not a clean error) against a real org, since that resource
     is preview-only -- the sibling POST call already knew to pass
     `7.1-preview`. Added the same flag to both GET call sites.
  4. `_comment`'s `--in-file -` does not read stdin the way `gh`'s
     `--input -` convention does; `az devops invoke` requires a real file
     path. Fixed by writing the comment body to a real temp file.
  5. The state marker is an HTML comment (`<!-- ... -->`); Azure DevOps
     work-item comments are stored/sanitized as HTML server-side and strip
     HTML comments from the persisted text entirely (confirmed: posted,
     read back, marker gone). Added a bracket-delimited marker form
     (`_marker_plain`/`_MARKER_PLAIN_RE` in `issue_loop_markers.py`) that the
     Azure DevOps adapter uses instead; `_parse_marker` recognizes either
     form so history from both providers reads back correctly. Also found
     Azure DevOps returns comment text with HTML entities escaped (`"` ->
     `&quot;`) even for content posted as literal JSON quotes -- `_parse_marker`
     now unescapes before matching (a no-op for GitHub's plain-text bodies).
  6. Azure DevOps's `wit/comments` GET returns comments newest-first
     (confirmed against a real work item's timestamps) -- the opposite of
     the GitHub GraphQL query's `last:N` (oldest-first within the page).
     `_latest_reservations` assumes chronological input order, so a claim
     comment could sort ahead of the reserve comment it followed and get
     silently ignored. Fixed by sorting comments by `createdDate` ascending
     in both `list_open_issues` and `release` before marker extraction.
  All 60 `test_repository_issue_loops.py` unit tests still pass unchanged
  after these six fixes (none of the fixes altered the mocked call shapes
  the tests assert on). Live proof: created a throwaway work item, ran
  identity verification -> fetch -> reserve -> claim -> release end to end,
  confirmed the reservation-marker history read back as
  `["reserved", "claimed", "released"]`, then deleted all scratch work items
  (`az boards work-item delete --yes`, recoverable via ADO's recycle bin if
  ever needed).
- **Not fixed, flagged as a distinct follow-up**: `list_open_issues`'s WIQL
  (`Select [System.Id] From WorkItems Where [System.State] <> 'Closed' ...`,
  no date/type/area scoping) hit Azure DevOps's 20000-item result cap
  against this real project's full history (confirmed: a narrower,
  date-scoped variant of the same query returned 292 items from this year
  alone). GitHub's adapter never hits an equivalent limit because a
  `repo` is a naturally small discovery boundary; an Azure DevOps `project`
  is not -- any real, long-lived project can exceed the cap. The
  declaration schema today has no field to narrow discovery (area path,
  iteration path, work item type, or max-age), so `list_open_issues` as
  written cannot be proven end-to-end against a project of meaningful age
  without one. This is the next slice for Phase 1's Validation Plan item,
  not closed by this leg.

### 2026-09-20 (cont.) - Found the actual root cause of the discovery cap; fixed it, and added optional narrowing

- Investigated the flagged discovery-scale follow-up above. The real root
  cause is more fundamental than "any large project can exceed the cap":
  `az boards query --project <name>` does **not** scope the WIQL query to
  that project by itself. Confirmed live: an otherwise-identical query
  without an explicit `[System.TeamProject] = '<project>'` clause runs
  **organization-wide** and hits the 20000-item cap even though the target
  project alone holds far fewer items (confirmed: the same query narrowed
  only by `[System.TeamProject]`, no date/type/area filter at all, returned
  exactly 1000 work items -- an API page-size ceiling, not the error cap --
  against a project whose org has clearly accumulated 20000+ items
  elsewhere). `--project` only sets API routing context; it is silently
  **not** a WIQL predicate. This means every declaration using this adapter
  before this fix was one `az boards query` release/behavior change away
  from silently scanning its entire organization on every discovery tick,
  not just large projects -- fixed by always including
  `[System.TeamProject] = '<project>'` explicitly in the base WIQL,
  unconditionally (not only under an opt-in scope).
  Live-proved via a WIQL row-count check (bypassing full `list_open_issues`
  per-item hydration, which is far slower against hundreds of real items):
  a query with the pre-fix shape (no `TeamProject` clause) fails with the
  same `VS402337` cap error; the same query with the fix succeeds.
- Also added the originally-planned `forge.discovery_scope` (azure-devops
  only; `work_item_types`, `area_path`, `max_age_days` -- at least one
  required) so a declaration can narrow discovery further beyond the
  TeamProject fix, for a project whose own single-project item count still
  approaches the cap. Live-proved: `max_age_days: 30` against the same real
  project narrowed 1000 -> 22 work items.
  Validation and WIQL-rendering logic extracted into a new
  `agent_dispatch.ado_discovery_scope` module (kept `repository_issue_loops.py`
  under its shrink-only 1811-line module-size cap: it was already near the
  ceiling before this slice). Own test file `test_ado_discovery_scope.py`;
  6 new/updated tests in `test_repository_issue_loops.py` cover declaration
  validation, provider threading, and WIQL row assembly. 74 tests total pass.
  **Phase 1's Validation Plan item is now fully closed**: discovery,
  batching, reservation, and settlement are all live-proved against a real
  Azure DevOps project, and the TeamProject-scoping bug that would have
  undermined every future declaration is fixed.

### 2026-09-20 (cont. 2) - Phase 5: wrote the turnkey colleague adoption path

- Picked up Phase 5 (the remaining unstarted phase) next. Surveyed the
  existing docs surface first: `repository-issue-loop.md` is a thorough
  internal-behavior reference (reservation protocol, forge adapters, host
  migration) but reads as engine-adjacent, not a colleague's from-scratch
  path; the SKILL only carries a brief pointer; and there was no single
  place enumerating the declaration schema's full field/type/default table,
  nor the available worker identity library, nor a worked example.
- Wrote `plugins/agent-dispatch/docs/repository-issue-loop-adoption.md`:
  a full schema reference table (every top-level field plus the `forge`,
  `reservation`, and `pool` sub-mappings, with type/required/default
  columns cross-checked directly against `validate_config`'s actual
  validation logic, not remembered from the earlier phases), the worker
  identity resolution order and today's built-in library (currently just
  `repository-issue-loop-default`, with guidance on authoring a repo-local
  one), and a complete worked YAML example for a new GitHub-backed
  repository plus the one-line diff for an Azure DevOps-backed one. Linked
  from the plugin README, `repository-issue-loop.md`'s own header, and
  (already) the SKILL's existing gotchas section.
- **Named the one known remaining gap explicitly rather than asserting the
  second Phase 5 bullet closed by omission**: diagnosing a genuinely novel
  `doctor` failure not already covered by the Operations command list still
  benefits from reading engine source today. Left that bullet unchecked and
  the doc's own closing section says so, with an explicit instruction to
  fold any newly-discovered failure-mode resolution into the doc itself
  rather than normalizing "read the source" as the fallback.
- Left the Validation Plan's "a colleague can stand up a new loop... without
  reading engine source" item unchecked deliberately -- that is an external,
  real-colleague validation this session cannot self-assert; it needs an
  actual colleague (or a clean-room-style dry run by someone who did not
  write the engine) trying the doc as written.

### 2026-09-20 (cont. 3) - Phase 2: assessed the never-supersede structural-guard question

- Picked up the effort's last remaining Phase 2 bullet: whether a named
  worker identity's structural boundaries can enforce the reviewer vision's
  never-supersede rule (never close/replace another author's open PR) more
  robustly than prose, closing `review-automation-reliability`'s Phase 6
  open question.
- **Grounded the assessment in what actually exists today, not
  speculation.** `agent_dispatch.worker_identities.WorkerIdentity` has
  exactly four fields (`name`, `description`, `rules`, `source_path`) --
  `rules` is markdown prose rendered into a prompt; there is no
  tool-permission or mutation-boundary field of any kind. Separately,
  neither forge adapter in `repository_issue_loops.py`
  (`GitHubProvider`/`AzureDevOpsProvider`) exposes a close/merge/supersede
  mutation at all -- both are narrowly list/reserve/claim/release. The
  live incident Phase 6 describes (a worker closing and replacing another
  author's PR) therefore happened entirely through the **embodied worker's
  own generic `gh`/`git` tool access** during its session, a surface
  agent-dispatch's own forge-provider boundary never touches and today's
  identity schema has no hook into.
- **The feasible mechanism is `agent-mcp`'s existing `gate` decorator, not
  a new primitive.** `gate` (`plugins/agent-mcp/src/agent_mcp/decorators/gate.py`)
  already does exactly the shape this needs: on a matched tool call, it
  issues a **preflight** upstream lookup keyed off the call's own
  arguments (e.g. fetch the target PR's author by PR number), evaluates an
  `allow_when` predicate over that lookup result, and denies the call
  (`on_deny: error`/`stub`/`drop`) if it fails -- fail-closed by default on
  preflight error. Contrast with the narrower `input_gate`, which only sees
  a call's own arguments with no external lookup and therefore *cannot*
  express "PR author differs from the acting identity" (a `gh pr close
  <number>` call's own arguments don't carry the PR's author; only a
  preflight fetch does). This means the generic reviewer/backlog recipe
  *can* be given a real structural guard -- "deny closing PR #N unless its
  author equals the declared `forge.producer_login`" is a one-`gate`-rule
  policy, enforced at the tool-call layer regardless of what the LLM
  decides, which is exactly the class of failure prose already tried and
  failed to prevent here.
- **Why this isn't landable as a small identity-schema addition today**:
  `gate` only intercepts calls that already flow through an agent-mcp
  bridge. The incident's actual close/replace mutation went through the
  embodied session's own direct `gh`/`git` CLI tool access, not through any
  MCP bridge -- there is nothing to gate yet. Landing the guard for real
  needs, at minimum: (1) the reviewer/backlog worker's mutating PR
  operations routed through an agent-mcp bridge instead of raw CLI (the
  `agent-worktrees` "pull-requests" vision's provider-neutral PR capability,
  which the reviewer loop "composes (or should)" per its own See Also, is
  the natural authoritative-operation surface to gate in front of); and
  (2) a new field on the declaration/identity schema (e.g. a
  `structural_guards` or `gate` reference) naming which gate policy a
  worker identity requires, since nothing in today's schema lets a
  declaration or identity express "and also refuse this class of mutation
  structurally." Both are real, scoped pieces of design work, not a
  same-slice implementation detail -- and this repo's own house style
  (established repeatedly in `review-automation-reliability`'s own Phase 9
  entries) requires a reviewed design slice before implementing a
  mechanism this consequential, which this journal entry deliberately does
  not attempt to pre-empt.
- **Conclusion, recorded in both efforts**: yes, structurally more robust
  than prose is achievable, and the concrete mechanism (`agent-mcp`'s
  `gate` decorator) already exists and needs no new invention -- but two
  prerequisites (PR-mutation traffic actually flowing through a gateable
  bridge, and a schema hook for a worker identity to require a gate policy)
  are not yet in place. Recorded as a candidate follow-up in
  `review-automation-reliability`'s own Phase 6 checklist (cross-referenced
  there) rather than treated as this bullet's job to implement. This
  effort's own Phase 2 bullet is closed by the assessment itself, per its
  own wording ("assess whether...").

### 2026-09-20 (cont. 4) - Phase 5: closed the doctor-diagnosis gap the prior slice named

- The prior Phase 5 slice's adoption doc named one open gap: diagnosing a
  novel `doctor` failure still benefited from reading engine source. Closed
  it for real instead of leaving it as a named-but-unaddressed follow-up.
  Read `loop_commands.py`'s `diagnoses.append(...)` call sites directly (12
  distinct failure codes plus `healthy` -- confirmed exhaustive by grepping
  every call site, not sampled) and added a complete resolution table to
  the adoption doc: each diagnosis's actual trigger condition and the
  concrete resolving action (an exact CLI command where one exists, e.g.
  `enable`/`setup`/the dead-letter `rearm` action `doctor` itself prints;
  a description of what to check otherwise, e.g. `supervisor-stalled`'s
  180-second-cycle stall threshold from `supervisor_health.py`).
  A genuinely novel diagnosis outside this closed set is now the only
  remaining case that should need source-reading, and the doc says to add
  it there when found.
- This closes Phase 5's second bullet: both bullets in Phase 5 are now
  checked. The Validation Plan's "colleague can stand up a new loop...
  without reading engine source" item remains deliberately unchecked --
  still an external validation this session cannot self-assert.
- Also corrected a Validation Plan oversight found while reviewing the
  section: "a declaration authored against a named worker identity contains
  no inlined behavioral policy prose" was left unchecked in earlier legs
  despite already being proven live on 2026-09-08 (the `dotfiles` switch to
  `worker_identity: fabrikam-harness-backlog`, verified byte-for-byte
  identical resolved guidance post-merge). Checked it off with a pointer to
  that existing evidence rather than re-proving it.
