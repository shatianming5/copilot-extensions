# Picker New-Session Prompt + Registered-Pivot Composer

- **Slug:** `picker-new-session-prompt-and-composer`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** per-phase model (mirrors `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s own convention)
- **Created:** 2026-09-30
- **Status:** Done
- **Vision:** `picker` (no existing §Features entry yet -- candidate follow-up
  once Phase A lands)

## Documentation impact

New CLI help text (`agent-worktrees create --seed`/`resolve --new --seed`)
is self-documenting at the flag level; no separate CLI reference doc exists
for these commands to update. No vision, architecture, or operating
procedure doc describes the New-worktree creation flow at a level this
change affects -- behavior is additive. As of 2026-10-02, Phase A's seed
prompt is live in the Picker's own flow (`_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED = True`):
both delivery seams (`engine_client.py`'s `--seed` forwarding,
`launch-session.{ps1,sh}`'s post-create `agent-worktrees embody` call) are
closed and validated (see the Journal). Still no separate user-facing doc
to update -- `agent-worktrees embody --help`'s existing `--seed` text
already documents the delivery contract this reuses verbatim, and the
Picker has no separate end-user reference doc of its own beyond its
in-app hints (the options dialog's own hint strings, unchanged by this
PR). This effort's own README (here) remains the authoritative
in-progress record of what's implemented vs. outstanding, kept current in
its Plan/Journal each session. 2026-10-02 (Phase B engine wiring):
`worktree-manager/README.md`'s own "Developing a pivot: render early,
render often" section already documents the `--demo`/preview render
workflow this change's own validation followed -- no update needed there.
Extended `demo_pivot.py`/`preview.py` (the preview fixture itself, not a
doc) so that workflow now exercises the new `create_action` affordance for
any future pivot change. `worktree-manager/docs/plugin-contribution-
contract.md`'s own `create_action` entry is updated in this PR too, to
describe the now-live button/modal/submit flow a producer's manifest
triggers.

## Guiding Intent

Two creation flows in the Picker both want the SAME missing capability --
an optional free-text field collected at creation time, before anything is
launched -- but neither one has it, and the underlying declarative
(registered-pivot) and bespoke (Worktrees) UI mechanisms don't share a
reusable way to add one:

1. **"New worktree…"** (Worktrees pane) should let the operator type an
   initial prompt so the freshly created session launches interactively
   with it already queued -- "fire and forget" instead of waiting through
   the lengthy auto-update/bootstrap flow before being able to type anything.
2. **"New task…"** (any registered pivot, starting with agent-dispatch's
   Tasks pane -- see that effort's own Phase 10) needs a real composer:
   title, prompt, and a tags/criteria picker, submitted as `propose`+`queue`.

Both are blocked on the same missing piece: **the Picker has no
generic way to open a field-spec-driven form when NO row is selected** (a
"create" flow, not an "act on this existing entry" flow). Landing that once,
well, unblocks both creation flows rather than solving each bespoke.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Driving agent | Authors and drives both phases | The effort's active worktree |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase PRs (Phase A can land and ship value on
  its own; Phase B builds on Phase A's extracted field-rendering helper).
- **Host (owns PRs):** Driving agent.
- **Delegates:** none currently.
- **Handoff:** **manual, sequenced-session loop** (matching
  `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s own established pattern) -- each
  session drives until its context fills, updates the Runbook below, then
  hands off via `generate_handoff_prompt`/`save_handoff_prompt` (never
  `trigger_handoff` -- this repo's `context-handoff` config is
  manual-cutover-only). The operator manually pastes the returned prompt
  into a fresh session to continue the loop.

## Context

Sibling, already-in-flight work this effort deliberately does **not**
duplicate or block on:
- **`agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`** (this repo) -- Phase 10 (New
  Task composer) is the primary CONSUMER of this effort's Phase B. That
  effort's Phase 10 Plan text should be read as depending on this effort
  landing first (added there as a cross-link).
- **`picker-creature-comforts`** (this repo, `efforts/active/`) -- also
  touches the New-worktree / launch flow (detached-launch-into-a-new-window,
  Ctrl+F search, tab-title projection), but targets entirely different
  capabilities (window/terminal management, not a creation-time input
  field). No overlap; both can land independently.
- **`worktrees-pivot-ux-overhaul`** (this repo) -- its own 2026-09-29
  Journal entry records a PLANNED rename of the Worktrees `SESS/T` column to
  `LENGTH` (format `"1s 25t"`). Unrelated to this effort's own scope, but
  worth knowing: `agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul` already adopted
  that exact format for ITS OWN `LENGTH` column (PR #4714, 2026-09-30) ahead
  of the Worktrees rename landing, specifically so the two stay visually
  consistent whenever that one ships.

### Investigation already done (2026-09-30, grounding this effort's Plan)

A background `explore` agent mapped the full "New worktree…" activation
path before this effort was written, so Phase A's Plan below is grounded in
real code, not assumption:

1. **Activation path:** `engine_maintenance_actions.py`'s `_open_optmenu()`
   (around line 405) builds a plain option-toggle dialog descriptor (Anchor
   repo / Bare / No Mux / AHP / Local model -- no free text) and pushes
   `ScopeDlgScreen` (`engine_dialogs.py:663`, a `ModalScreen[bool]` built from
   `Static` + `SelectionList` + `FocusGroup` -- **no `Input`/`TextArea`
   widget at all**). Confirming calls `_confirm_new_worktree()`
   (`engine_maintenance_actions.py:11-26`), which folds the selected toggles
   into a `_decide({"action": "new", ...})` call.
2. **Launch plan resolution:** the decision becomes a `picker_app
   .LaunchRequest` (`__main__.py:1090-1100`ish), resolved via
   `engine_client.resolve_launch_plan()` (`__main__.py:1188-1211`), which
   shells to `agent-worktrees resolve --new --json` (launch PLANNING only --
   `agent-worktrees create` itself, per its own help text, explicitly
   performs "no launch, no mux").
3. **Actual launch exec:** `_run_relocated_mux_launch()`
   (`__main__.py:~1237-1268`) execs the Manager-owned
   `worktree-manager/bin/launch-session.{ps1,sh}` script -- "the ONE
   canonical muxed-launch implementation" -- passing `--project`/
   `--worktree-id`/`--base`/`--bare-resume`. **That script already supports
   an arbitrary `--` passthrough** (`launch-session.ps1:163`: "everything
   after this separator is copilot passthrough args (e.g. `--acp --stdio`)",
   appended again near line 1227) straight to the real `copilot` CLI process
   it ultimately execs.
4. **A seed-prompt mechanism ALREADY EXISTS, just on a different command:**
   `agent-worktrees copilot` (`plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees
   /copilot_cli.py:37-57`) already has `--seed` ("Seed prompt injected as
   the session's first interactive turn once Copilot is ready") and
   `--seed-ready-timeout`, plus `--new`. **Note (2026-10-04, Phase 9 of
   `worktree-manager-control-plane`, #5210):** `copilot --headed` itself has
   since been retired -- it duplicated terminal-window-spawning mechanics
   Phase 3b had already relocated out of agent-worktrees, and as a result
   never ran `launch-session.{ps1,sh}`'s mux-daemon registration.
   `headed_actions.py`'s `open_worktree_cli_headed()` (the Picker's "Launch
   in new window" verb, reachable only for an EXISTING worktree row, never
   this creation path) now calls `_run_launch` in-process with
   `LaunchRequest.new_window=True` instead -- the window-opening mechanic
   is a launch-plan MODIFIER on the ordinary resume decision, not a
   separate command. If this effort still wants a headed/new-window option
   for the creation path, compose it the same way (`LaunchRequest(mode="new",
   new_window=True, seed_prompt=...)`), not via the retired
   `copilot --headed`. **The Picker's actual "New worktree" creation
   flow does NOT go through `agent-worktrees copilot` at all** -- its
   own `launch-session.ps1`/`.sh` is a separate, older, more elaborate
   script that does NOT currently forward to `agent-worktrees copilot
   --seed` internally (confirmed: no `--seed` reference anywhere in that
   script as of this writing).
5. **Reusable generic form infra exists, but is steer-coupled:**
   `PivotFormScreen` (`steering_form.py:37`) already renders a field-spec
   list (`text`/`textarea`/`choice`/`multichoice` -> `Input`/`TextArea`/
   `RadioSet`/`SelectionList`, see `steering_form.py:154-210`) from a plain
   constructor arg (`fields: list[dict]`) -- exactly the "field-spec-driven
   form" shape both Phase A and Phase B want. **But its button row (Confirm/
   Save/Reset) and submit semantics are hard-wired to the STEER transport**
   (`agent-dispatch steer submit` / `card draft save` / `card draft clear`
   via `on_clear_draft`) -- wrong semantics for either "launch with this
   prompt" (Phase A) or "propose+queue a new task" (Phase B). Reusing it
   verbatim would be wrong; extracting its field-rendering guts
   (`steering_form.py:154-210`'s type->widget mapping) into a shared,
   submit-semantics-agnostic helper both a new lean creation-form screen AND
   the existing steer form can call is the right shape -- matches this same
   file's own "mechanical extraction... no behavior change" convention
   already used once to split it out of `steering.py`.
6. **The registered-pivot `PivotAction`/`kind:"form"` mechanism is row-scoped
   by design:** `pivot_manifest.py`'s `PivotAction` (line 68) is documented
   as "one entry in a registered pivot's **Enter sub-menu**" -- every field
   spec (`fields_from`) is resolved via `_pivots.resolve_path(rec, ...)`
   against an already-selected entry (`engine_pivot_actions.py`'s
   `_open_pivot_form()`, ~line 367). There is no "pivot-level, no row
   selected" action type today. Worktrees' own "+ New worktree…" button
   (the thing Phase 10's Plan literally says to "mirror") turns out to be
   entirely hand-coded UI chrome (`engine_selection.py`'s `new_worktree_row`
   + the `"BTN"` zone's `"N"` case in `engine_maintenance_actions.py`), NOT
   a generic, manifest-driven mechanism any registered pivot can opt into.
   **This is the real, previously-unidentified prerequisite Phase B needs to
   build**, not assume already exists.

## Plan

### Phase A — "New worktree…" gains an optional Prompt field
- [x] Extract `PivotFormScreen`'s field-type-to-widget rendering
      (`steering_form.py:154-210`) into a shared, submit-semantics-agnostic
      helper (mirroring this file's own "mechanical extraction" precedent);
      re-wire `PivotFormScreen` to call it, confirming byte-identical
      behavior (existing steer tests must still pass unchanged). **Done
      2026-09-30:** new `picker_tui/field_widgets.py` module, `compose_field(f,
      i) -> (widgets, rec)` (pure, no `self`/draft/visibility coupling);
      `PivotFormScreen._compose_one` now calls it and layers its own
      `show_when`/`visible` bookkeeping on top. Full `production_picker` suite
      (840 passed, 1 skipped) confirms byte-identical behavior.
- [x] Build a new, lean creation-prompt screen (its own class -- NOT a reuse
      of `PivotFormScreen` itself, whose Confirm/Save/Reset button row and
      draft-persistence semantics don't fit a "collect one optional prompt
      before launch" flow) using the extracted helper for the one `textarea`
      field it needs. **Done 2026-09-30:** new `picker_tui/seed_prompt_screen
      .py`, `SeedPromptScreen(ModalScreen[str])` -- always dismisses with a
      plain `str` (`""` when skipped/escaped/blank-launch), a `Launch`/`Skip`
      `FocusGroup` button row, Enter-from-textarea advances to it (mirroring
      `PivotFormScreen`'s single-question path). 5 new Pilot tests cover
      launch/skip/escape/blank-launch/whitespace-stripping.
- [x] Chain it into `_open_optmenu()`'s flow: after `ScopeDlgScreen`
      confirms (and only when "Bare" is NOT selected -- a bare worktree gets
      no Copilot bootstrap at all, so a seed prompt has nothing to attach
      to), open the new prompt screen; an empty/skipped prompt behaves
      exactly as today (no change to existing behavior when unused). **Done
      2026-09-30:** `_open_optmenu()`'s `_after` callback now checks "Bare"
      and either calls `_confirm_new_worktree(dlg)` directly (Bare) or pushes
      `SeedPromptScreen` and calls `_confirm_new_worktree(dlg,
      seed_prompt=result)` on its dismiss. `_confirm_new_worktree` always
      carries `options["seed_prompt"]` (`""` when none). 5 existing
      New-worktree confirm tests updated for the extra screen hop (each now
      needs 2 Enter presses: textarea->buttons, then activate Launch); 2 new
      tests cover the Bare-skips-the-screen path and a typed prompt carrying
      through to the decision. Full suite: 847 passed, 1 skipped. The
      screen's live gate (`_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED`) stayed off until the
      remaining delivery seams closed -- see the next item and the Journal;
      it is now `True` (2026-10-02), and the skip condition has since grown
      to also cover Anchor-repo and remote-machine targets (see the
      Journal's 2026-10-02 entries).
- [x] **Persist the prompt at creation time; deliver it on first attach**
      (current design, replacing the Picker-specific launch-script argument
      chain originally planned here -- see the Journal for the full
      redesign history). `agent-worktrees create`/`resolve --new` gained
      `--seed`, persisting it as `WorktreeRecord.pending_seed` (both
      creation call sites that matter locally; a remote `--machine` target
      explicitly rejects the combination rather than relay it unsafely).
      `agent-worktrees embody`/`copilot` discover and deliver a
      `pending_seed` on the first real attach -- both when THEY create the
      mux pane, and when some other caller (the Picker's own
      `launch-session.{ps1,sh}`) already did, via embody's resume branch --
      claiming (clearing) it under a race-safe write-guard immediately
      before delivery, restoring it only on an unconfirmed delivery, and an
      explicit `--seed` supersedes/clears any stale pending one too.
      **Both seams now closed (2026-10-01/02, see Journal):**
      (1) **closed** -- the Picker's live flow now calls `resolve --new
      --seed` (`engine_client.resolve_launch_plan()` gained a `seed` kwarg
      once `engine_client.py`'s module-size cap was relieved by extracting
      `engine_execution_leg.py`); `__main__.py`'s `_resolve_for()` threads
      `LaunchRequest.seed_prompt` through. (2) **closed** --
      `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` now call `agent-worktrees embody
      --worktree-id <id>` (detached, best-effort) immediately after their
      own CREATE-branch `new-session`/`tmux new-session` call succeeds --
      never on the JOIN branch (an already-live session already had its
      chance). embody's own "already embodies this worktree" resume branch
      (the mux session now exists) claims + delivers any pending seed via
      its existing ready-poll/send-keys path; a no-op when nothing is
      pending costs one cheap venv-python round trip, dispatched detached so
      the operator's attach never waits on embody's own (up to 180s)
      seed-ready-timeout. Validated LIVE (non-`--demo`): created a real,
      disposable worktree with `--seed`, stood up its `wt-<id>` mux pane
      manually (mirroring exactly what the launcher's own create-branch
      does), then called `agent-worktrees embody --worktree-id <id>
      --seed-ready-timeout 3 --json` and confirmed the exact JSON contract
      this hook depends on: `"created": false, "resumed": true, "seeded":
      true`. Cleaned up (`remove-system`) immediately after. `_SEED_PROMPT_
      ENABLED` flipped to `True` in `engine_maintenance_actions.py`; 5
      pre-existing New-worktree confirm tests (written before this flip)
      updated for the now-unconditional extra screen hop (2 Enter presses:
      textarea->buttons, then activate Launch). Full `production_picker` +
      `test_launch_session_unwrap.py` suite: 895 passed, 1 skipped, clean
      (three transient Textual-pilot timing flakes along the way, each
      confirmed pre-existing/unrelated by isolated re-run against the
      unmodified baseline).
- [x] Confirm the end-to-end behavior matches `agent-worktrees copilot
      --seed`'s own documented contract ("Seed prompt injected as the
      session's first interactive turn once Copilot is ready") -- the
      prompt must not race the auto-update/bootstrap flow the operator
      explicitly wants to skip past. **Confirmed 2026-10-01/02:** embody's
      own ready-poll (`sessions.mux_seed_pane`) only types the seed once
      Copilot's own input caret is detected ready (stable across two polls),
      and the detached dispatch means this poll runs concurrently with --
       never ahead of -- the launcher's own auto-update/bootstrap flow and
      the operator's attach.
- [x] Tests: the new field-rendering helper (unit, from item 1), the new
      creation-prompt screen (modal behavior: submit/skip/escape, from item
      2), the decision-dict/`LaunchRequest`/launch-script argument threading
      (each layer: `engine_client.resolve_launch_plan()`'s `--seed`
      forwarding, `launch-session.{ps1,sh}`'s post-create `embody` call --
      pinned via a `test_launch_session_unwrap.py` ordering/parity guard
      covering both platforms), and a regression check that
      `ScopeDlgScreen`/steer behavior is completely unchanged when no
      prompt is ever entered (the 5 updated + 2 existing New-worktree
      confirm tests).
- [x] **UX follow-up (operator request, 2026-10-03): fold the separate
      `SeedPromptScreen` step into `ScopeDlgScreen` itself** -- one dialog,
      not two the operator steps through in sequence. Content stack:
      header -> optional Prompt field -> "Additional options:" -> the
      existing Anchor/Bare/No Mux/AHP `SelectionList` -> Create/Cancel,
      with exactly three focus stops (prompt box, options list, buttons)
      and Create as the still-default stop. **Done:** `ScopeDlgScreen`
      gained a `show_prompt` constructor flag (Clean/Sync never sets it, so
      its dialog is pixel-for-pixel unchanged) that composes the same
      `field_widgets.compose_field` textarea `SeedPromptScreen` used,
      directly above the options list; `self.seed_prompt` is set the
      instant Confirm is pressed (read by the caller via a kept screen
      reference, never via the dismiss value, which stays a plain `bool`
      for every other caller). `_open_optmenu()` composes ONE
      `ScopeDlgScreen(dlg, show_prompt=...)` instead of chaining a second
      screen; the compatibility gating (Bare/No Mux/Anchor repo/remote
      silently drop whatever was typed, since none of those targets can
      ever deliver it) now runs once, at Confirm time, reading the live
      checkbox state instead of being resolved before a second screen even
      opened. `SeedPromptScreen` itself (now dead code -- its only caller
      was `_open_optmenu()`) and its dedicated test file were deleted
      rather than left stale. Render- and live-TTY-verified (tmux,
      `--demo`): the merged dialog's content stack renders exactly as
      specified, Tab cycles prompt -> list -> buttons (wrapping back to
      prompt from buttons) and Enter in the prompt box (originally wired to
      advance to the options list; **corrected same-day** per further
      operator feedback -- see the 2026-10-03 Journal entry below -- to
      jump straight to Create instead, since the prompt is almost always
      left blank or typed-and-done) jumps straight to Create, a typed
      prompt lands in the textarea correctly, and
      Escape cancels cleanly with no side effects. 9 New-worktree dialog
      tests rewritten for the one-screen flow (2 renamed
      `..._skips_seed_prompt` -> `..._drops_seed_prompt` to describe the
      new silent-drop-not-skip semantics) plus 1 new dedicated focus-stops
      test; a dialog-focus assumption in the pre-existing
      `test_scope_dialog_highlight_is_focus_gated` (Clean/Sync-adjacent but
      exercising the New-worktree dialog) also needed its Tab count fixed.
      Full suite: 1551 passed, 3 skipped, 3 failed -- all 3 confirmed
      pre-existing (same `test_mux_daemon.py`/`test_update.py`/
      `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` class flagged in this effort's
      own prior Journal entries), none touching any file this change
      modified.

### Phase B — Generic registered-pivot "create" action (unblocks Tasks Phase 10)
- [x] Add a new `PivotAction`-adjacent concept to `pivot_manifest.py` for a
      **pivot-level** action -- no `rec`/selected entry, a STATIC field spec
      declared directly in the manifest (not resolved via `fields_from`
      against a row) -- e.g. a new top-level manifest key
      (`create_action`? name TBD) alongside the existing `actions` list.
      **Done 2026-10-01:** new `CreateAction` dataclass + strict
      `parse_create_action`/`_parse_create_fields` validators, in their own
      new sibling module `pivot_create_action.py` (NOT inline in
      `pivot_manifest.py` -- that module was already close to the 1000-line
      cap; see the Journal). `RegisteredPivot.create_action: CreateAction |
      None = None` wired into `parse_manifest`; re-exported from `pivots.py`.
      Shape: `{"label", "key" (default "create"), "fields": [{name,type,
      options?,allow_other?,show_when?}], "run", "confirm"}` -- the exact
      `{name,type,options,allow_other,show_when}` field shape
      `steering._normalize_form_fields` already accepts for a row's dynamic
      `request_input`, so Phase A's `field_widgets.compose_field` renders it
      with zero changes. 18 tests across `test_pivots.py`/
      `test_pivot_registry.py` (schema parsing/defaults, malformed-manifest
      isolation, each required/malformed-field case, `show_when`
      cross-validation, blank/non-string option rejection,
      `create_action.run` command resolution + malformed-argv/invalid-path
      isolation -- added across 6 Copilot-review rounds on PR #4831, see
      the Journal). Full `production_picker` suite: 867 passed, 1 skipped
      (re-ran clean after every review round). Module-size gate: OK
      (`pivot_manifest.py` 922 lines, under the 1000-line cap with room;
      `pivot_create_action.py` 163 lines).
- [x] Engine wiring: a UI affordance to trigger it when the registered
      pivot's list has focus but no row is meaningfully selected (mirror
      Worktrees' "N" button row, but data-driven -- reuse Phase A's
      extracted field-rendering helper for the widget types). **Done
      2026-10-02:** `button_set()` (`engine_model.py`) returns `["NC"]` for
      a "registered" pivot whose `reg.create_action` is set, else `[]`
      (unconditionally empty before this); `stops()`/`region_heads()` add a
      conditional `("BTN", 0)` stop right after the machine sub-nav, before
      the task rows. `TasksView.build_chrome` (`engine_views.py`) renders a
      new data-driven `registered_create_row()` (`engine_selection.py`) --
      the button's own label comes straight from `create_action.label`, no
      hardcoded per-pivot text table (mirrors `new_worktree_row()`'s
      rendering shape, simplified to one chip since there's only ever one).
      `_activate()`'s `BTN` branch (`engine_maintenance_actions.py`) routes
      `btn == "NC"` to a new `_open_create_action()`
      (`engine_pivot_actions.py`), which pushes the new
      `CreateActionScreen` (below) and, on Confirm, calls a new
      `_run_create_action()` -- confirmed reusing
      `_run_pivot_form_submit`'s exact `format_form_template(action.run, {},
      values)` + `rt.run_resolved(argv)` + `rt.invalidate()`/`rt.ensure()`
      plumbing verbatim, `ctx={}` since there is no row to resolve entry
      tokens against.

      **`CreateActionScreen`** (new module `create_action_screen.py`)
      mirrors `SeedPromptScreen`'s shape (lean, Confirm/Cancel only, no
      draft) but renders `create_action.fields` (any mix of
      text/textarea/choice/multichoice, `show_when` conditionals, tabs when
      >1 field) instead of one hardcoded textarea. `create_action.confirm:
      true` shows an inline are-you-sure (mirroring `ResetConfirmScreen`'s
      FocusGroup pattern, swapped into the same frame rather than a second
      pushed screen) before the collected values are actually
      dismissed/submitted -- Cancel is the initial choice.

      **Shared extraction, not duplication:** `CreateActionScreen` needs the
      exact same multi-field tab/conditional-visibility/advance-on-Enter/
      value-collection mechanics `PivotFormScreen` (the Steer surface)
      already has, so rather than copy ~150 lines of subtle logic, extracted
      a new `FieldQuestionsMixin` (`field_questions.py`) from
      `PivotFormScreen` first (mechanical, mirroring `field_widgets.py`'s own
      precedent -- confirmed byte-identical: full suite re-ran clean before
      touching anything else), with one override point
      (`_focus_final_control()`) for what to focus once Enter advances past
      the last question. Both screens mix it in now.

      **Tests:** 4 new engine-wiring tests
      (`test_registered_pivot_create_action_button_appears_and_absent`,
      `_opens_and_submits`, `_cancel_does_not_submit`, `_confirm_gate`) plus
      a new manifest-writer test helper
      (`_write_tasks_manifest_with_create`). A genuine gap surfaced while
      writing these: a plain `text`-type field had no Enter/Ctrl+Right-to-
      advance mechanic of its own (only textarea/choice/multichoice did, via
      `field_widgets`' custom widgets -- `Input`'s native word-cursor binding
      claimed Ctrl+Right first). **Fixed, see the next Journal entry:** a
      new `_AdvancingInput` (`field_widgets.py`) forwards Enter/Ctrl+Left/
      Right the same way `_AutoExpandTextArea` already does; `compose_field`
      now uses it for `text` fields, and the tests exercise the real
      `pilot.press("ctrl+right")` keyboard sequence instead of calling
      `_activate_tab()` directly.

      **Render-verified, not just unit-tested** (per this project's own
      "render early, render often" README mandate): extended the official
      `--demo`/preview fixtures first -- `demo_pivot.py` gained a `create`
      verb (a harmless synthetic acknowledgment) and `preview.py`'s
      `_DEMO_PIVOT_MANIFEST` gained a matching `create_action` (title +
      prompt fields) -- then captured real screenshots
      (`picker screenshot --demo --pivot "Demo Queue"` for the button row;
      a short driven script using `picker_tui.capture`'s own
      `capture_modal_async`/`export_screenshot` seam for the modal states)
      at each milestone. **This caught a real bug unit tests missed
      entirely:** the inline are-you-sure prompt's dynamically-mounted
      `FocusGroup` rendered with zero height (no CSS rule gave it one) --
      invisible in a screenshot, yet still fully queryable/interactable in
      a headless Pilot test, so all 4 new tests passed while the actual
      rendered UI was broken. Fixed by generalizing `#create-buttons {
      height: 1; ... }` to a screen-wide `FocusGroup { height: 1; ... }`
      rule (now covers the dynamically-mounted confirm-prompt group too).
      Full `production_picker` + `test_launch_session_unwrap.py` +
      `test_picker_preview_mode.py` suite: 913 passed, 1 skipped (one
      different pre-existing Textual-pilot timing flake confirmed
      isolated-pass, same class observed throughout this session's earlier
      PR too).
- [x] `agent-dispatch`'s manifest declares its own `create_action` (title +
      prompt/goal textarea + a tags/criteria picker -- see the Tasks-pane
      effort's own Phase 10 Plan for the exact field list and the pool-
      filter-vocabulary source still to be confirmed). **Resolved
      2026-10-02:** traced the vocabulary question all the way through --
      `registrar.py`'s `_FILTER_DIMS` only names dimensions, never values, so
      added `filter_vocabulary()` (aggregates every active declaration's
      `effective_filters().permit` per dimension) plus a new
      `agent-dispatch registrar vocabulary [--dim] [--json]` CLI exposing it
      (reuses `RegistrarSources().refresh()`, the same active-declaration
      sweep `registrar doctor` already performs -- "already cached", per the
      operator's own framing). Confirmed live against this machine's real
      registrar set (not just unit tests). The picker's generic
      `create_action` field schema gained a new `options_command` key
      (`pivot_create_action.py` + `pivot_registry_materialization.py`'s
      command-resolution, mirroring `run`'s own identity-verified resolution)
      for a `choice`/`multichoice` field whose options are sourced from a
      live subprocess instead of a static array; `allow_other` is auto-forced
      true whenever it's set, so a failed/slow/empty command (bounded to 5s,
      `tasks.OPTIONS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`) always degrades to free text rather
      than ever blocking the dialog. `engine_pivot_actions.py._open_create_action`
      resolves any such fields off-thread (`_run_bg`) before pushing
      `CreateActionScreen`, so the render flow is never blocked.
      `pivots/agent-dispatch.json` now declares the real `create_action`:
      title/prompt + a `criteria` multichoice sourced from
      `registrar vocabulary --dim task-type --json`, submitted via a new
      `agent-dispatch create --criteria-json` flag (a JSON array merged into
      `--label`) -- chosen because the ACTUAL task-routing mechanism today
      is the legacy `pool.labels & task.labels` intersection
      (`reviewer_loop_commands.py`), not `registrar.py`'s newer
      `Filters.permits` (confirmed that's only consulted for
      declaration-to-machine matching, `registrar_reconcile.py`, today) --
      so `task-type`'s vocabulary (pool names + labels) is the dimension
      that's genuinely wired to real routing right now. repo/role/
      capabilities vocabulary exists (`filter_vocabulary` returns them too)
      but isn't yet connected to an actual routing predicate for a created
      task -- left as a named follow-up, not invented speculatively here.
- [x] Submitting calls `propose`+`queue` (already-implemented `client.py`
      calls) against the coordinator, per that effort's own Phase 10 spec.
      **Resolved 2026-10-01, no new plumbing needed:** `agent-dispatch
      create` (no `--proposed`) already performs the propose-then-queue
      lifecycle in ONE subprocess call (`create_cli.py`'s `_cmd_create`
      creates the task directly in queued/claimable state; `propose` is
      only the OPPOSITE -- an explicit flag that keeps it a non-claimable
      draft for a later separate `queue <id>`). So `create_action.run` for
      agent-dispatch can be a single argv template (e.g. `["agent-dispatch",
      "create", "{field.title}", "--prompt", "{field.prompt}", ...]`) run
      through the SAME single-subprocess `format_form_template`/
      `run_resolved` path the row-scoped `kind:"form"` action already uses --
      no two-step orchestration, no propose-id-capture-then-queue chaining,
      needs inventing at the picker layer.
- [x] Tests: the new manifest field parses correctly (and degrades
      gracefully for a pivot that doesn't declare one); the UI affordance
      appears/is absent correctly; a synthetic pivot's create action renders
      and submits via the generic mechanism (mirroring
      `test_registered_pivot_*` patterns already in
      `test_picker_tui.py`); `agent-dispatch`'s own composer round-trips
      title/prompt/tags into the exact `propose`/`queue` call shape.
      **Completed 2026-10-02:** `test_pivots.py` (options_command parsing +
      allow_other auto-force + blank-argv rejection), `test_pivot_registry.py`
      (options_command command-path resolution/validation, mirroring the
      existing `create_action.run` coverage), `test_resolve_dynamic_options.py`
      (the new `tasks.resolve_dynamic_options` helper: success/timeout/
      not-found/non-zero-exit/non-JSON/non-array/non-string-items, all ->
      `[]`, never raises), `test_picker_tui.py` (two new engine-wiring tests:
      live options land in the rendered field before the modal opens; a
      failing command still opens the modal with an empty/free-text-only
      field) -- plus `agent-dispatch`'s own `test_registrar.py`
      (`filter_vocabulary` aggregation/omission semantics) and `test_cli.py`
      (`--criteria-json` merge/validation). All new + pre-existing tests
      green; not render-verified with a screenshot this round (the engine
      wiring itself was already screenshot-verified in the prior session --
      this change extends the field schema, not the render path). All three
      halves (manifest-parsing, engine-wiring, agent-dispatch's own
      manifest) are now done.

## Validation Plan

- [x] Phase A: create a real worktree from the Picker with a typed prompt;
      confirm the new session's first interactive turn is that prompt, with
      no race against the auto-update/bootstrap sequence. Also confirm the
      SKIP path (no prompt entered) launches exactly as before this effort
      -- a zero-regression bar, not just a new-feature bar. **Substantially
      validated 2026-10-01/02 (see Journal); the literal end-to-end
      click-through completed 2026-10-03 (see Journal entry below).** The
      UI chain itself (options dialog -> `SeedPromptScreen` -> typed text
      captured correctly) was confirmed in a REAL terminal via `tmux`, not
      just Pilot (2026-10-01, `--demo` mode). Both delivery seams are closed
      and unit/ordering-pinned for both platforms
      (`test_launch_session_unwrap.py`), live in the Picker's flow by
      default (`_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED = True`). The contract seam 2 depends
      on (`launch-session.{ps1,sh}` calling `agent-worktrees embody
      --worktree-id` right after its own CREATE-branch pane exists) was
      validated LIVE against a real, disposable worktree + a manually stood-
      up mux pane mirroring the launcher's exact shape -- confirmed
      `"created": false, "resumed": true, "seeded": true"`, i.e. the claim+
      deliver path genuinely fires. **2026-10-03: the single literal,
      non-demo Picker binary run (options dialog -> typed prompt -> Create
      -> real worktree + real mux session + real Copilot process) was
      chained end-to-end** via `psmux`-driven `python -m worktree_manager
      picker copilot-extensions` (no `--demo`), landing a genuine git
      worktree (a fresh dated worktree id, clean `git
      status`, correct branch) and a real spawned Copilot v1.0.91 session.
      The `embody` contract fired (`"seeded": true`) confirming the exact
      delivery mechanism proven in isolation on 2026-10-02 now also fires
      from the real UI path. One caveat, carried over unchanged from the
      2026-10-02 seam-2 entry: visually confirming the seed text landing as
      the target pane's OWN first turn is not observable from inside this
      harness's own sandbox -- the keystroke-delivery mechanism redirects
      into the orchestrating agent session instead (the same previously-
      identified, already-dismissed artifact, not a new one). Given the
      JSON contract is identical to the already-proven isolated case, and
      the full UI chain is now also proven, this item is checked off on
      that basis.
  - [x] Confirm behavior with "Bare" selected: no prompt screen is shown at
        all (nothing to seed). (`test_new_worktree_bare_skips_seed_prompt`,
        passing against the now-default-on `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED`.)
- [x] Phase B: from a live coordinator, use the Tasks pane's new "New
      task…" action to hand-author a task; confirm it appears with the
      exact title/prompt/tags entered, immediately eligible for its
      declared pool per the tags/criteria submitted. **Partially validated
      2026-10-02 (later session):** the GENERIC mechanism this depends on
      -- `options_command`'s live subprocess resolution, the off-thread
      `_run_bg` wiring, and the full Confirm -> `run_resolved` round trip --
      was proven in a REAL terminal via `tmux` (not Pilot, not headless
      capture): launched `worktree-manager picker --demo` in a fresh tmux
      pane, drove it with `send-keys` (`]` switches pivot -- see the new
      Journal entry for the full key map discovered this session), opened
      the Demo Queue's "+ New test request…" dialog, confirmed the
      `criteria` multichoice tab rendered the real, live-resolved vocabulary
      (`recalibration`/`maintenance`/`audit`/`neurotoxin-safety` + `Other…`)
      read back via `capture-pane`, and submitted through to the harmless
      `demo_pivot.py` acknowledgment. **2026-10-03: driven against a
      genuinely live `agent-dispatch` coordinator** (pid-confirmed `health`
      `"status": "ok"`, one active registrar declaration,
      `agent-ssh-dtssh-host`) via `psmux` against the real (non-`--demo`)
      Tasks pivot: the real task list (16-17 live tasks) rendered, the
      "+ New task…" affordance appeared (after discovering and fixing a
      real environment gap -- see below), and the Title/Prompt/Criteria
      tabbed dialog captured all three fields correctly, confirmed via
      `capture-pane` at every step. **Blocked at the time** on
      `agent-dispatch: error: unrecognized arguments: --criteria-json` --
      the machine's globally-installed `agent-dispatch` CLI venv predated
      the merged `--criteria-json` flag from PR #4991. Diagnosed as a
      clean, atomic, deployment-currency gap, not a source-code defect, and
      deliberately not force-reprovisioned mid-validation-pass against the
      then-live coordinator.
      **2026-10-05: item closed.** The machine's `agent-dispatch` CLI and
      the running coordinator daemon had since converged on the same
      current version (`0.11.6-dev1`, confirmed via `agent-dispatch
      --version` and `agent-dispatch health`'s `slot.active.version`) --
      the deployment-currency gap closed itself via this machine's normal
      `agent-worktrees update --force` cadence, with no code change needed.
      Re-ran the exact same live click-through in a fresh
      `copilot-extensions` worktree (not the stale anchor): real Picker via
      `tmux`/`psmux` (no `--demo`) against the real, actively-serving
      coordinator (33 live tasks, registrar `agent-ssh-dtssh-host`
      confirmed active via `agent-dispatch registrar doctor`), `]` to the
      Tasks pivot, `+ New task…`, filled Title/Prompt/Criteria (Criteria
      left on its `Other…` free-text fallback), `Enter` to submit. The
      dialog closed and the coordinator confirmed creation
      (`agent-dispatch find "VALIDATION-TEST" --repo copilot-extensions`
      returned the task with the exact title/prompt entered, `repo:
      github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions`, `status: queued`, id
      `0caa5585697c48bd95554e3f15bddaa3`) -- no `--criteria-json` error, no
      orphaned/partial task. Immediately abandoned the test task
      (`agent-dispatch abandon 0caa5585... --permit --reason "..."`,
      confirmed `status: abandoned`) and killed the tmux session, leaving
      the real coordinator and its backlog otherwise untouched. This item
      and the whole Validation Plan are now fully closed.
- [x] Both phases: full `worktree-manager` + `agent-dispatch` test suites
      stay green (baseline: whatever the two packages' full-suite pass
      counts are at the time each phase's PR opens -- record them in that
      PR/Journal entry, not assumed from an earlier session).
      **Completed 2026-10-02:** `worktree-manager` full suite: 1539 passed,
      3 skipped, 6 failed -- all 6 confirmed pre-existing (reproduced
      identically on the base commit via `git stash`; none touch any file
      this session changed: `test_mux_daemon.py` x2, `test_update.py`
      tarball-symlink, `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py`, and two
      unrelated `test_picker_tui.py` Textual-pilot timing flakes, the same
      flake class the Journal already flagged once this effort). `agent-
      dispatch` full suite: 3758 passed, 23 skipped, 5 failed -- all 5
      likewise confirmed pre-existing via the same `git stash` check
      (`test_cli.py` consume/baton x3, `test_managed_companion.py`,
      `test_supervisor.py` fleet-nudge; none touch `create_cli.py`/
      `registrar*.py`).

## Proposal

_Pending — this effort's plan itself will be submitted for review per the
repo's `pr-self-merge` profile before Phase A implementation begins._

## Journal

### 2026-09-30 — Kickoff, grounded in a full investigation of the New-worktree flow
Created from a live conversation that started as a status check on
`agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`'s Phase 10 ("New task…" composer).
Investigating why Phase 10 hadn't been started surfaced a real, previously
undocumented prerequisite gap (see "Investigation already done" above): the
registered-pivot manifest system has no concept of a pivot-level "create"
action at all -- every existing `kind:"form"`/`kind:"card"` action is
row-scoped. In the same conversation, the operator independently raised a
second, related want: an optional Prompt field on Worktrees' own existing
"New worktree…" dialog, so a freshly created session can launch
`--interactive` with a seed prompt already queued ("fire and forget").
Rather than solving either narrowly, folded both into one effort since they
share the same missing capability (a field-spec-driven form opened with no
row selected) and the same reusable widget-rendering code
(`PivotFormScreen`'s field-type mapping, currently coupled to steer-specific
submit semantics).

Investigated the FULL "New worktree" activation-to-launch path before
writing this effort's Plan (five-layer trace: dialog -> decision dict ->
`LaunchRequest` -> launch-plan resolution -> the Manager's own
`launch-session.{ps1,sh}` script) and found a genuinely useful shortcut: a
seed-prompt mechanism (`--seed`/`--seed-ready-timeout`) ALREADY EXISTS on
`agent-worktrees copilot`, just on a command the Picker's creation flow
doesn't currently call (it only reaches an EXISTING worktree's "Launch in
new window" action, never the creation path, which goes through a
different, older script). This significantly de-risks Phase A: no new
seed-prompt PROTOCOL needs inventing, only new plumbing to reach the
existing one (or an equivalent explicit flag on the launch script, exact
mechanism TBD at implementation time).

No code changed yet this session -- this entry (+ the effort doc itself) IS
the handoff artifact. Next session should start at Phase A's first Plan
item (the `PivotFormScreen` field-rendering extraction) since it's shared
groundwork both phases depend on.

### 2026-09-30 — Phase A item 1: field-rendering extraction
Extracted `PivotFormScreen._compose_one`'s field-type -> widget-construction
logic (the `choice`/`multichoice`/`text`/`textarea` branches, `steering_form
.py:154-210`) into a new pure function `compose_field(f, i) -> (widgets, rec)`
in a new sibling module, `picker_tui/field_widgets.py`. It takes no `self`,
touches no draft/visibility/conditional-field state, and returns exactly the
same `rec` shape (`name`/`type`/`options`/`allow_other`/`primary`/`other`)
`PivotFormScreen._q` has always stored, minus the two caller-owned keys
(`show_when`/`visible`) a conditional-fields caller layers on afterward.
`PivotFormScreen._compose_one` now calls it and adds those two keys itself;
`steering_form.py`'s imports were trimmed to drop what moved out (`Input`,
`Widget`, `_AutoExpandTextArea`, `_OTHER_LABEL`, `_SteerRadioSet`,
`_SteerSelectionList` are no longer referenced directly there).

Verified byte-identical behavior: the three steer-form-focused suites
(`test_pivot_steering_modals.py`, `test_picker_steer_form_flow.py`,
`test_picker_steer_button_row.py`, 44 tests) pass unchanged, and the full
`worktree-manager/tests/production_picker` suite (840 passed, 1 skipped --
the skip pre-dates this change) is fully green, confirming no regression
anywhere else that touches this code path.

Next: Phase A item 2 (the new lean creation-prompt screen using
`compose_field` for its one `textarea` field), then item 3 (wiring into
`_open_optmenu()`'s flow) and item 4 (threading the prompt through the
decision dict -> `LaunchRequest` -> launch-script argument chain -- see this
README's own "Investigation already done" §5-6 for the exact call sites).

### 2026-09-30 — Phase A item 2: the new lean creation-prompt screen
Built `SeedPromptScreen` (`picker_tui/seed_prompt_screen.py`), a
`ModalScreen[str]` using `field_widgets.compose_field` for its one `textarea`
field. Deliberately its own class, not a `PivotFormScreen` reuse -- no
Confirm/Save/Reset row, no draft persistence, nothing to resume (a
skipped/blank prompt is exactly today's launch, unchanged). Dismisses with a
plain `str`: the collected (stripped) prompt, or `""` for skip/escape/blank
Launch -- never `None`, so a caller never needs a tri-state check.

**A real bug the mid-session rendering-preview check caught:** the first cut
put `padding: 1 0 0 0` directly on the 1-row-tall `#seed-buttons` `FocusGroup`
to add a visual gap above it -- but that padding eats into the widget's own
fixed `height: 1` content box, pushing its child `Static` row fully outside
the visible area. The Launch/Skip buttons were composed, mounted, and
logically present (`query_one` found them fine) but **invisible** -- headless
Pilot assertions on values/dismiss results never caught this since they don't
inspect rendered pixels. Caught by literally exporting the screen to an SVG
snapshot (`App.export_screenshot()`) and rasterizing it (`resvg-py`; `cairosvg`
needs a native `libcairo` this Windows box doesn't have, `svglib`+`reportlab`
hit the same native-backend gap) to actually look at it. Fixed by moving the
gap to `margin: 1 0 0 0` (space *outside* the widget) instead of `padding`,
matching `PivotFormScreen`'s own convention of a separate spacer `Static`
rather than padding a fixed-height button row. Re-rendered to confirm both
buttons are now visible and correctly styled.

**Takeaway for the rest of this effort (and Phase B's generic create-action
UI):** a CSS-driven modal's layout correctness is not fully covered by
headless Pilot assertions alone (widget presence/values only, not paint
'') -- an SVG-export + raster spot-check is a cheap, repeatable way to catch a
"logically there but invisible" layout bug before it ships. Worth doing once
per new screen, not just once here.

5 new Pilot tests (`test_seed_prompt_screen.py`): Launch with typed text,
Skip button, Escape, blank Launch (⇔ Skip), and whitespace-stripping. Full
`production_picker` suite: 845 passed, 1 skipped (the one unrelated failure
seen mid-run, `test_registered_pivot_action_menu_runs_and_invalidates`, is a
pre-existing timing flake -- passes clean in isolation, confirmed before
concluding this).

**A circular-import bug surfaced and was fixed in the same pass:**
`field_widgets.py` originally imported `_AutoExpandTextArea`/`_OTHER_LABEL`/
`_OTHER_SENTINEL`/`_SteerRadioSet`/`_SteerSelectionList` FROM `.steering` --
but `steering.py` itself imports `PivotFormScreen` from `steering_form.py`,
which imports `compose_field` FROM `field_widgets.py`, so any entry point
that reaches `field_widgets` before `steering`/`engine` have fully
initialized hit a partial-module `ImportError`. Worse, mid-fix (before
`steering.py` was updated to match), the two modules briefly defined their
OWN separate copies of these classes, producing a stealth isinstance-mismatch
failure (`WrongType: Node matching '#q-0'... found _AutoExpandTextArea`) that
only one test caught. Fixed properly, not papered over: the five widget
classes/constants now live ONLY in `field_widgets.py` (a dependency-free base
layer with zero import of `.steering`/`.steering_form`), and `steering.py`
imports them back for backward-compatible re-export. Full suite green after
the fix confirms both the cycle and the duplicate-class issue are resolved,
not just hidden by import order.

Next: Phase A item 3 (wiring `SeedPromptScreen` into `_open_optmenu()`'s
flow, skipped when "Bare" is selected) and item 4 (threading the collected
prompt through the decision dict -> `LaunchRequest` -> launch-script argument
chain).

### 2026-09-30 — Phase A item 3: wired into `_open_optmenu()`'s flow
`_open_optmenu()`'s `ScopeDlgScreen` confirm callback now branches on
whether "Bare" is among the confirmed options: Bare skips straight to
`_confirm_new_worktree(dlg)` exactly as before (nothing to seed -- a bare
worktree gets no Copilot bootstrap at all); otherwise it pushes
`SeedPromptScreen(target=f"{tm} {te}")` and, on its dismiss, calls
`_confirm_new_worktree(dlg, seed_prompt=result)`. `_confirm_new_worktree`
now always includes `options["seed_prompt"]` in the decision dict (`""` when
none was collected) -- `__main__.py`'s decision-handling doesn't read it yet
(that's item 4), so today it's inert but present, ready to thread through.

Updated the 5 pre-existing New-worktree confirm tests in `test_picker_tui.py`
for the new screen hop: each now presses Enter twice after confirming
Create (once to advance focus from the textarea to the button row, once
more to actually activate Launch) -- the same "accept+advance, not
accept+submit" mechanic `_AutoExpandTextArea`/`PivotFormScreen` already use.
Added 2 new tests: `test_new_worktree_bare_skips_seed_prompt` (Bare -> no
screen, `seed_prompt == ""`) and `test_new_worktree_seed_prompt_carries_
through` (a typed prompt reaches `options["seed_prompt"]` unchanged). Full
`production_picker` suite: 847 passed, 1 skipped. Also ran the rest of
`worktree-manager`'s test tree (`tests/` minus `production_picker/`): 643
passed, 5 pre-existing failures confirmed unrelated (mux-daemon,
trusted-materializer-parity, tarball-update tests -- none touch
steering/field_widgets/seed_prompt code).

### Phase A item 4 -- deliberately NOT started this session; a concrete
### recommendation for the next one instead of a rushed attempt
Threading the collected prompt from here to an actual typed keystroke in a
freshly-launched Copilot session is a materially different kind of risk than
items 1-3: those only touched Picker-internal TUI code with a thorough
Pilot-test harness. Item 4's target, `launch-session.{ps1,sh}`, is the ONE
canonical script every real "New worktree…" launch on this machine goes
through (`_run_relocated_mux_launch`'s own docstring: "the ONE canonical
muxed-launch implementation") -- it is ~2000 lines of PowerShell managing
mux-pane creation, bootstrap, and update sequencing, with no equivalent
Pilot-style test harness, and the harness's own "Validate beyond unit tests"
policy (`AGENTS.md`) explicitly calls for more than unit coverage before
landing a change to a shared launch path this consequential.

**What this session's investigation clarified that the original Plan didn't
know yet:** `agent-worktrees copilot --seed` does NOT pass `--seed` to the
`copilot` CLI process itself -- it delegates to `handoff_cli.cmd_embody`,
which (after the real mux pane + copilot process already exist) calls
`sessions.mux_seed_pane(pane, seed, ready_timeout=...)`: a pane-level
primitive that waits for Copilot's input prompt to actually appear inside
the mux pane, THEN sends the seed text as keystrokes. There is no
`copilot --seed` CLI flag to forward through the launch script's existing
`--` passthrough at all -- the effort README's original "confirm whether the
passthrough mechanism can carry it through unchanged" question is now
answered: **it cannot**, because the seeding happens one layer up, against
the pane, after the process is already running and ready.

**Recommended shape for item 4** (not yet implemented): expose the existing
`sessions.mux_seed_pane` primitive as a small, focused `agent-worktrees`
CLI subcommand (e.g. `agent-worktrees internal seed-pane --session <name>
--seed <text> --ready-timeout <n>`), callable from PowerShell/Bash via a
plain subprocess call, the same way the script already shells out to
`agent-worktrees resolve`/`remux`/etc. `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` would call
it once it knows the mux pane it just created holds the live `copilot`
process (right after the point where it currently just returns/attaches),
guarded behind a new optional argument (name TBD, e.g. `--seed-prompt`)
threaded from `_run_relocated_mux_launch`'s `args` <- `LaunchRequest.
seed_prompt` <- `decision["options"]["seed_prompt"]` (the last mile already
built this session). This reuses a primitive already proven correct in
production (`embody`/`handoff-cutover` already depend on it) rather than
reimplementing pane-ready-detection and keystroke-typing a second time in
PowerShell.

**Validation bar for whoever picks this up** (per the harness's own
"Validate beyond unit tests" policy): unit tests for the new CLI subcommand
and the argument-threading layers, PLUS an actual live "New worktree…"
launch from the Picker with a typed prompt, confirmed to land as the
session's real first interactive turn with no race against bootstrap --
this item should not be called done on unit tests alone.

### 2026-09-30 — Item 4 redesigned + mostly implemented, after the operator
### asked a better question than this effort's own original Plan
The operator, reviewing the "new CLI subcommand" recommendation above,
asked: **"Can this not be a standard part of `agent-worktrees create`?"**
That reframing turned out to be architecturally correct and significantly
simplified the implementation -- recorded here in full since it replaces
most of the "recommended shape" written earlier in this same session.

**Why it works:** the Picker's "New worktree…" never calls `agent-worktrees
create` directly -- it calls `agent-worktrees resolve --new --json`
(`engine_client.resolve_launch_plan`) -- but investigation confirmed **both
commands share the exact same core function**, `worktree_creation
._create_worktree_core()`. `create`/`resolve` are both documented as "no
launch, no mux": they can only ever PERSIST a seed as intent, never type it
(no pane/process exists yet at creation time) -- but persisting it on the
worktree's own tracking record, rather than threading it through
Picker-specific decision-dict/LaunchRequest/launch-script plumbing, means
**any** path that later creates a live Copilot session for that worktree
can discover and deliver it, not just the Picker's own launch-session
script. This also makes `--seed` usable directly from a script/automation
context (`agent-worktrees create --seed "..."`), which the original
Picker-only design never would have been.

**Implemented this session** (`plugins/agent-worktrees`):
1. **Persistence:** `tracking.WorktreeRecord` gained `pending_seed: str |
   None` (mirrors `bound_agent`'s "emitted only when set, byte-identical
   legacy YAML" convention exactly -- same read/write pattern in
   `load_record`/the raw-YAML content builder). Threaded through
   `tracking_lifecycle.create_new_record()` -> `worktree_creation
   ._create_worktree_core()` (new `pending_seed` kwarg, end to end).
2. **Both creation CLI surfaces gained `--seed`:** `resolve_cli.py`'s
   `resolve --new --seed <text>` (what the Picker actually calls) and
   `worktree_ops_cli.py`'s `create --seed <text>` (the direct
   agent/script-facing command) -- both pass straight to
   `_create_worktree_core(..., pending_seed=...)`.
3. **TWO independent consumption points**, since there are genuinely two
   ways a live Copilot session gets attached to a freshly created
   worktree, and item 4's Plan text originally only knew about one:
   - **`agent-worktrees embody`/`copilot`'s own "create" path**
     (`handoff_cli.cmd_embody`, the `--new`-or-fresh-worktree branch):
     when no explicit `--seed` is given, it now falls back to the record's
     `pending_seed` (`seed_from_pending` flag) and clears it on confirmed
     delivery (`seed_result["ok"]`) -- left in place on a timeout/failure so
     a later attach can retry, never silently lost.
   - **`cmd_embody`'s own RESUME ("already a live mux session") path** --
     this is the one the original Plan text didn't anticipate needing at
     all: the Picker's `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` creates the exact same
     `wt-<id>` mux-session name `cmd_embody` itself uses
     (`sessions.mux_session_name`), but *without ever calling embody* --
     so from `cmd_embody`'s perspective, calling it after the script has
     already stood up the pane looks exactly like an ordinary **resume**.
     The resume branch previously just reported `resumed: true` and
     returned -- now it ALSO checks for and delivers a `pending_seed`
     against the resolved pane (`mux_copilot_pane`/`mux_active_pane`)
     before returning, with the same confirmed-delivery-clears /
     unconfirmed-leaves-in-place contract as the create path. An explicit
     `--seed` is deliberately NOT delivered on this resume path (unchanged
     "one live session per worktree" contract -- only a *persisted*
     pending prompt is, since that's a leftover obligation from creation,
     not a fresh request).
4. **Picker plumbing, now much smaller than originally planned, but with
   ONE more hard blocker found and deliberately left for next time:**
   `picker_app.LaunchRequest` gained `seed_prompt: str | None`; `__main__
   .py`'s `action == "new"` decision handler reads `decision["options"]
   ["seed_prompt"]` into it -- that much is done and tested. **Reverted
   this session:** threading `seed_prompt` on into `engine_client
   .resolve_launch_plan()` (as a new `seed` kwarg, forwarded as `--seed`
   only when `new=True`) -- `engine_client.py` is at `worktree-manager`'s
   hard 1000-line module-size cap with ZERO slack (999/1000 BEFORE this
   session touched it at all, confirmed via `git show` against this
   session's own starting commit) and, unlike `tracking.py`'s shrink-only
   BASELINE (soft, explicitly wideneable via a reviewed
   `tools/module-size-baseline.json` edit -- done this session, 4078 ->
   4082), this is a hard CAP with no such escape hatch; the tool's own
   message is explicit: "split this module into smaller components." A
   proper split of `engine_client.py` is its own real refactor, not a
   corner to cut mid-feature by deleting unrelated lines elsewhere to buy
   headroom -- so the `seed` kwarg and its `--seed` forwarding were
   reverted back out (confirmed via `git checkout <pre-session-commit> --
   engine_client.py`/its test file) rather than shipped as a line-count
   workaround. **No new argument on `LaunchRequest` needed reaching
   `_run_relocated_mux_launch`'s `args` or `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` at
   all** -- that script's job is simply "exist and create the pane" exactly
   as it always has; something else (today: a dedicated `agent-worktrees
   embody --worktree-id <id>` call) discovers and delivers whatever got
   persisted onto the record.

Tests: `tracking`/`tracking_write` (round-trip unaffected -- 262 passed),
`embody` (6 new cases: pending-seed-on-create delivered+cleared,
unconfirmed-delivery-leaves-it, explicit-seed-doesn't-touch-pending,
pending-seed-on-RESUME delivered+cleared, unconfirmed-on-resume-leaves-it,
plus the pre-existing 46 unaffected -- 48 total). `engine_client`'s own
`seed`-forwarding was implemented, tested (4 new cases), THEN REVERTED this
same session once the module-size gate caught `engine_client.py`'s hard
1000-line cap (see above) -- its test file was reverted alongside it, back
to this session's own starting commit. `test_production_picker_transplant
.py` (2 new, both still valid and kept: `seed_prompt` reaches
`LaunchRequest` from the decision dict, blank normalizes to `None` not
`""` -- this layer doesn't touch `engine_client.py` at all). Targeted
`agent-worktrees` regression set (`tracking`, `tracking_write`,
`codename_cli`, `launch_preflight`, `owner_inheritance`, `paired_carve`,
`embody`, `handoff_cutover`): 480 passed. Full `worktree-manager` suite
(both `tests/` and `tests/production_picker/`): 644 + 847 passed, only the
same pre-existing unrelated failures seen before this session touched
anything (`test_mux_daemon`, `test_trusted_materializer_parity` x2,
`test_update` -- all four about update/tarball/materializer-parity
machinery nothing here touches). One additional pre-existing flake
observed and confirmed unrelated: `test_profile_assignment.py::
test_concurrent_allocation_serializes_bag_positions` races on a Windows
pycache-clearing guard (`plugin_activation`'s own anti-stale-bytecode
check, copilot-extensions #3802) under concurrent subprocess imports on
this busy shared machine -- nothing to do with tracking/create/embody.

**What's genuinely still missing -- TWO remaining pieces now, not one:**
1. `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` itself needs to actually CALL
   `agent-worktrees embody --worktree-id <id>` (no `--seed`
   flag -- let it discover `pending_seed` itself via the resume path just
   built) once it has created the worktree's pane, for a **brand-new**
   worktree creation launch only (never on an ordinary resume launch, where
   there's nothing newly pending in the overwhelming majority of cases,
   though harmlessly a no-op there too since a resume's record has no
   `pending_seed` unless one was persisted and never yet delivered). This
   is still real PowerShell/Bash surgery on the "ONE canonical muxed-launch
   implementation" script with no Pilot-style test harness, and still needs
   a live "New worktree…" launch with a typed prompt to confirm delivery,
   not just unit tests -- the validation bar recorded earlier in this same
   Journal entry family still applies, now narrowed to exactly this one
   call site instead of a whole new CLI subcommand plus multi-layer
   argument threading.
2. **New this session:** `engine_client.resolve_launch_plan()` needs its
   own `seed` kwarg + `--seed` forwarding (reverted here for the
   module-size reason above) -- genuinely needs `engine_client.py` split
   into smaller components first (a real refactor, not a quick follow-on),
   OR a deliberate, separately-reviewed decision to raise its hard
   1000-line cap in `tools/module-size-baseline.json`/wherever that cap is
   actually enforced from (distinct from `tracking.py`'s already-wideneable
   soft baseline) -- whoever picks this up should resolve that choice
   explicitly, not default to widening without discussion.

Without #2, `LaunchRequest.seed_prompt` reaches `_resolve_for()` but is
currently dropped on the floor there (never passed to
`resolve_launch_plan()`, so a locally created worktree's `pending_seed`
never actually gets persisted via the Picker's own flow) -- `--seed` on
`agent-worktrees create`/`resolve --new` directly (bypassing the Picker)
already works today and is the quickest way to verify the persistence +
both consumption paths end-to-end before #1/#2 are tackled. Everything
else in the chain (persistence, both consumption paths, the Picker UI
collecting the prompt and threading it onto `LaunchRequest`) is
implemented and tested.

### 2026-09-30 — PR #4768 opened, then hardened against real Copilot review findings
Pushed and opened PR #4768 for Phase A items 1-4. Its automated review came
back `COMMENTED` with 2 HIGH + 4 MEDIUM/LOW findings, all legitimate --
fixed rather than dismissed:

- **HIGH -- discarded prompt:** confirmed `LaunchRequest.seed_prompt` never
  reaches `resolve_launch_plan()` (the `engine_client.py` module-size
  blocker above), so the live Picker flow would silently drop a typed
  prompt. Fixed by gating `SeedPromptScreen` out of `_open_optmenu()`'s
  live flow behind a new `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED = False` module constant
  (`engine_maintenance_actions.py`) until both remaining seams land --
  the screen/helper/persistence/consumption code all stay built and
  tested, just not yet user-visible. The two integration tests
  (`test_new_worktree_bare_skips_seed_prompt`,
  `..._seed_prompt_carries_through`) now force the flag on via
  `monkeypatch` to keep exercising the real wiring; the other five
  pre-existing New-worktree tests reverted to their original (no extra
  screen hop) expectations.
- **HIGH -- unsafe pane targeting:** `cmd_embody`'s resume-path delivery
  used `mux_copilot_pane(wt_id) or mux_active_pane(wt_id)` -- the fallback
  is "whatever pane is currently active" (could be a bare shell), while
  `mux_seed_pane` treats any `❯` as ready and would happily submit the
  prompt as a shell command. Fixed: delivery now requires the
  registry-identified `mux_copilot_pane(wt_id)` specifically; the
  display-only `new_pane` JSON field keeps the friendlier fallback (purely
  informational, never a delivery target).
- **MEDIUM -- duplicate-delivery race:** two concurrent resume attempts
  could both read the same `pending_seed` and both call `mux_seed_pane`.
  Fixed with an explicit claim/restore pattern under `tracking._RecordLock`
  (new `_claim_pending_seed`/`_restore_pending_seed` helpers in
  `handoff_cli.py`): the claim (load -> clear -> save) is a short locked
  RMW per this codebase's own documented lock-scoping convention ("never
  hold the lock across I/O"); the slow `mux_seed_pane` wait happens
  unlocked afterward, with a second short locked RMW to restore the text
  only if delivery goes unconfirmed. Applied to BOTH consumption sites
  (create path and resume path).
- **MEDIUM -- missing real round-trip coverage:** the embody tests all
  replace `load_record`/`save_record` with fakes, so they couldn't catch a
  YAML-serialization bug. Added
  `test_create_new_record_pending_seed_round_trips` (mirrors the existing
  `..._bound_agent_round_trips` test exactly): a multiline, YAML-special-
  character prompt through real `create_new_record`/`load_record`, the
  no-prompt case omits the key entirely, and clearing + re-saving omits it
  again (not an empty/null scalar).
- **LOW fixes:** added this "Documentation impact" section (above) and a
  patch changefile for each touched plugin (`agent-worktrees`,
  `worktree-manager`, via `tools/changefile.py add`); replaced a personal
  machine-name alias in a new test with a neutral `example-host`
  placeholder.

Also found and fixed two leftover duplicate/stale Plan checkboxes in this
README from an earlier editing pass (a duplicated, unchecked "build a new
lean creation-prompt screen" item sitting right under its own already-
`[x]`'d entry) -- the review flagged the doc at those exact line numbers.

Tests after all fixes: `handoff_cli`/`tracking` targeted regression set
(480 passed, now including the new round-trip test), full
`production_picker` suite (848 passed, 1 pre-existing skip). Both
`handoff_cli.py` and `tracking.py` stayed within their module-size budgets
throughout (1000/1000 and 4082/4082 respectively -- genuinely zero slack
left in `handoff_cli.py` now; any FURTHER addition there needs its own
trim-or-split, same as `engine_client.py` already does).

### 2026-09-30 — A second review round found three more real issues
Pushed the fixes above; the automated review ran again and found three
MORE legitimate issues (none repeats of the first round -- all fixed, not
dismissed):

1. **An explicit `--seed` left a separately-persisted stale `pending_seed`
   behind.** If a worktree had BOTH an unconsumed `pending_seed` (from
   creation) and the caller later ran `embody --seed "..."` explicitly, the
   explicit seed delivered fine but the old `pending_seed` was never
   touched -- a LATER ordinary resume would then re-deliver that stale
   prompt into an already-active conversation as an unwanted later-turn
   injection. Fixed: the create-path now ALWAYS claims (clears) any
   `pending_seed` under the write guard on first attach, regardless of
   whether an explicit `--seed` was also given -- an explicit seed
   supersedes AND consumes the stale one. Only a value that was actually
   *claimed* (not an explicit one) is restored if its own delivery goes
   unconfirmed, so a failed explicit `--seed` never resurrects an unrelated
   old prompt. Renamed the test
   (`test_explicit_seed_wins_and_supersedes_any_stale_pending_seed`) to
   assert the corrected contract with a stateful fake record.
2. **`--seed` was only threaded through ONE of `resolve --new`'s three
   creation call sites.** Fixed the other two: the interactive-TTY path
   (`resolve_launch_cli._resolve_new_context`, used when `--new` is given
   without `--json`) now also passes `pending_seed=getattr(args, "seed",
   None)`. The remote-machine path (`--machine` + `--new`, which relays a
   NAIVELY space-joined command string over SSH with zero shell quoting)
   does NOT attempt to thread `--seed` through that same unsafe
   string-concatenation -- proper quoting for an arbitrary remote shell is
   its own real, security-sensitive task, not a quick addition. Instead
   `--seed` is explicitly rejected when combined with `--machine`, with a
   clear error naming why; 2 new tests (`test_resolve_cli_seed_guard.py`)
   cover the rejection and confirm an ordinary (no-`--seed`) remote `--new`
   is completely unaffected.
3. **`create --seed`'s own help text overpromised delivery.** It said
   "whichever path first attaches a live session... delivers and clears
   it" -- true in intent, but today only `agent-worktrees embody`/`copilot`
   actually implement that contract; an arbitrary direct tmux/psmux attach
   does nothing. Reworded the help text (both `create --seed` and `resolve
   --new --seed`) and `_create_worktree_core`'s own docstring to name the
   actual supported consumer explicitly, matching the gated-off Picker
   flow's own honesty bar from the first review round.

Tests: agent-worktrees targeted regression set (`tracking`,
`tracking_write`, `embody`, `handoff_cutover`, `codename_cli`,
`launch_preflight`, `owner_inheritance`, `paired_carve`, plus the new
`test_resolve_cli_seed_guard.py`): 483 passed. Module-size gate: OK
(`tools/check-module-size.py` run directly, not just inferred from the
earlier pre-push hook output).

### 2026-09-30 — A THIRD review round found three more correctness issues
Three rounds of real findings now, each a genuine issue, none a repeat:

1. **`_RecordLock`'s default mode silently degrades** to an in-process-only
   lock when the cross-process sidecar times out (a deliberate graceful-
   degradation feature for *critical* writers per its own docstring) --
   which defeated the claim-once guarantee entirely under contention: a
   stalled holder and a degraded contender could both read+deliver the
   same seed. Fixed: both `claim_pending_seed`/`restore_pending_seed` now
   pass `require_sidecar=True` (fail closed -- `TimeoutError` caught,
   nothing claimed -- rather than ever degrade).
2. **The claim happened far too early** -- right where the record was
   first loaded, well before dry-run handling, profile/backend validation,
   lifecycle rejection, a concurrent-session check, or even confirming
   `mux_new_session` actually succeeded. Any of those early-return paths
   could permanently consume `pending_seed` with nothing ever delivered.
   Fixed: the create path now only PEEKS (read-only) at the pending seed
   early (for display/dry-run purposes), and does the real claim (lock +
   reload + clear + save) immediately before the actual `mux_seed_pane`
   call, after `mux_new_session` has already succeeded.
3. **`pending_seed`'s YAML serialization was unsafe for arbitrary text.**
   The hand-rolled `_yaml_scalar` helper (shared with simpler fields like
   `bound_agent`) only quotes a LEADING reserved-indicator character --
   a value like `"false"` would round-trip as the YAML boolean `False`,
   and a multiline or `": "`-containing prompt could produce invalid YAML
   entirely. Fixed: `pending_seed` now serializes through `yaml.safe_dump`
   (the same pattern this file already uses for structured fields like
   `dispatch_attempt`), which handles arbitrary scalars correctly.
   Strengthened the round-trip test with an explicit `"false"`-as-string
   case (not just multiline) to prove the fix.

Also extracted `claim_pending_seed`/`restore_pending_seed` into a new
sibling module, `pending_seed.py` (mechanical extraction, matching this
file's and this repo's own established "many small `_cli.py`/helper
modules, not one growing monolith" convention) -- `handoff_cli.py` kept
hitting its own 1000-line hard cap on every one of these fix rounds, and
splitting out a self-contained, independently-testable pair of functions
is the correct response once a module is genuinely full, not another round
of comment-shrinking. `tracking.py`'s own soft baseline was widened again
(4082 -> 4090) for the real `yaml.safe_dump` fix's few extra lines.

Tests: full targeted regression set (`tracking`, `tracking_write`,
`embody`, `handoff_cutover`, `codename_cli`, `launch_preflight`,
`owner_inheritance`, `paired_carve`, `resolve_cli_seed_guard`): 483
passed. Module-size gate: OK.

### 2026-09-30 — Fourth and fifth review rounds: a real non-JSON gap, a
### merge-safety hole, and documentation hygiene
Two more rounds, five more genuine findings (still zero repeats):

**Round 4:**
- **`resolve --new --machine X --seed Y` (no `--json`) still slipped
  through.** The rejection only lived in `_resolve_json_mode`; the
  non-JSON dispatcher in `cmd_resolve` checks `state.use_new` BEFORE
  `state.requested_machine`, so it would silently create a LOCAL seeded
  worktree instead of honoring (or rejecting) `--machine` at all. Moved
  the validation up into `cmd_resolve` itself, before the JSON/non-JSON
  split, so both paths reject consistently; rewrote the guard tests to
  exercise `cmd_resolve` end-to-end (both JSON and non-JSON) instead of
  only the JSON-mode internal function.
- **This effort's own Plan item 4 still read like the superseded design**
  (the Picker-specific launch-script argument chain) with a redesign note
  bolted on top, leaving the "actionable" text inconsistent with both the
  implementation and the Journal. Rewrote the item to state the CURRENT
  design directly (persist at creation, deliver via embody on first
  attach, two still-incomplete seams named explicitly); the design-history
  narrative stays here, in the Journal, where it belongs.
- **`pending_seed.py`'s and `field_widgets.py`'s module docstrings
  described their own extraction history** ("mechanical extraction...
  moved verbatim") instead of their lasting responsibility. Reworded both
  to be timeless; the history is this Journal's job.

**Round 5:**
- **The claim-once guarantee had a merge-safety hole:** any OTHER process
  that loaded the SAME record before a claim (e.g. to bump an unrelated
  field like `summary`) and saved its own stale in-memory snapshot AFTER
  the claim would silently resurrect the already-delivered seed -- nothing
  in `_save_record_unlocked` knew `pending_seed` needed protecting the way
  `effort_revision`/`lifecycle_revision` already are. Fixed the same way:
  a new monotonic `WorktreeRecord.pending_seed_revision` field, bumped on
  every claim/restore, with a merge rule in `_save_record_unlocked` --
  "take the on-disk value when its revision is newer" -- so a stale save
  can never roll a delivered/cleared seed backward. Added
  `test_stale_full_record_writer_cannot_resurrect_a_delivered_seed`
  (real `create_new_record`/`load_record`/`save_record`, not fakes) to
  prove it.
- **`restore_pending_seed` gave up permanently after one 2s sidecar
  timeout**, silently losing a prompt that had ALREADY been claimed for a
  delivery that then failed -- strictly worse than `claim_pending_seed`
  giving up (which loses nothing, since the claim itself never happened).
  Added a bounded retry (3 attempts, 1s apart) before accepting the loss.
- **`--seed` was only rejected alongside a remote `--machine` target.**
  `resolve --json --worktree-id <id> --seed ...` and `--base --seed ...`
  both silently succeeded while discarding the prompt (it's only
  meaningful with `--new`, which persists it onto a NEW record). Added a
  blanket `requested_seed and not state.use_new` rejection, ahead of the
  (now narrower) remote-specific one.
- **A test docstring overstated the current wiring**, claiming
  `engine_client.resolve_launch_plan` already forwards `--seed` on a
  truthy value -- it doesn't yet (that's the still-incomplete seam this
  whole effort keeps naming). Reworded the docstring to say only what the
  test actually verifies (decision-dict -> `LaunchRequest` normalization),
  and to point at the real gap instead of implying it's closed.

Tests: full targeted regression set re-run clean (315 + 170 passed across
two batches, covering `tracking`/`tracking_write`/`embody`/
`resolve_cli_seed_guard` plus `handoff_cutover`/`codename_cli`/
`launch_preflight`/`owner_inheritance`/`paired_carve`). `tracking.py`'s
soft baseline widened again (4090 -> 4105) for the revision-merge fix.
Module-size gate: OK.

### 2026-10-01 — Phase B item 1 (manifest schema): new session, fresh worktree
Resumed via handoff `d75d8a385b3c4ab5b94a3558d15c297b`. Phase A's worktree
was already finalized (PR #4768 merged, no live copilot-extensions worktree
left); created a fresh, isolated worktree per the handoff's own instruction
before touching anything.

**Choice made:** of the handoff's two offered next-slices (close Phase A's
remaining seams, or start Phase B), picked **Phase B**. Reasoning: Phase A's
second remaining seam (`launch-session.{ps1,sh}` calling `agent-worktrees
embody` after creating a worktree's pane) explicitly needs **a live "New
worktree…" launch with a typed prompt** to validate (per the harness's own
"Validate beyond unit tests" policy) -- not achievable from this headless
session. Phase B's own Plan is fully testable headless via the existing
Pilot-test harness (`production_picker`'s 850+ tests already prove this
pattern), so it was the slice this session could actually drive to a
genuine, tested state rather than a half-finished, unvalidatable one.

**Implemented (Plan item 1 -- the manifest schema):** a new `CreateAction`
dataclass (`label`, `key` default `"create"`, `fields` -- a tuple of static
field-spec dicts, `run` -- an argv template, `confirm`) plus strict
`parse_create_action`/`_parse_create_fields` validators that raise
`ManifestError` on a malformed `create_action` (consistent with
`pivot_manifest.py`'s existing strict-validation convention for `actions`,
rather than `steering._normalize_form_fields`'s lenient-degrade convention --
this spec is manifest-authored, not runtime/operator data, so a typo should
surface at discovery time).

**A real module-size near-miss, caught before it became one:** the first
draft added this directly to `pivot_manifest.py`, which was already at 819
lines (not baselined -- meaning the ordinary 1000-line hard cap applies with
no grandfathered ceiling). The straightforward addition would have pushed it
to 1030 -- over cap, and exactly the kind of "one more honest addition tips
an un-baselined file over" failure this guard exists to catch before merge,
not the engine_client.py-style "already over cap, zero slack" case Phase A's
item 4 flagged. Moved `CreateAction` + its two parser functions into a new
sibling module, `pivot_create_action.py` (113 lines), imported by
`pivot_manifest.py` the same way it already imports from `pivot_actions.py`.
`pivot_manifest.py` ends this session at 922 lines -- under cap, with real
room left, instead of permanently baselined at 1030+. Also re-exported
`CreateAction` from `pivots.py` (the package's public aggregator) alongside
the existing `PivotAction`/`RegisteredPivot` exports.

**Field-shape reuse, confirmed, not assumed:** deliberately chose the exact
`{name,type,options,allow_other,show_when}` shape
`steering._normalize_form_fields` already accepts for a row's dynamic
`card.request_input`, so Phase A's `field_widgets.compose_field` (the
pure, submit-semantics-agnostic widget renderer extracted in Phase A item 1)
will render a `create_action`'s fields with **zero changes** when the engine
wiring (item 2) lands -- confirmed by reading `compose_field`'s actual
signature/behavior, not assumed from the shape's name alone.

**Two investigations resolved a previously-open design question (the
propose+queue chaining) with NO new plumbing needed, contrary to what this
effort's own Plan text implied:**
1. Read `_run_pivot_form_submit`/`_open_pivot_form`
   (`engine_pivot_actions.py`) end to end: the existing row-scoped
   `kind:"form"` action already does exactly "collect field-spec-driven
   values, substitute `{field.<name>}` into `run`, execute ONE subprocess,
   invalidate the cache" via `pivot_actions.format_form_template` +
   `RegisteredPivotRuntime.run_resolved`. This plumbing has NO dependency on
   a selected row beyond the `ctx` tokens it also substitutes (which a
   create action simply won't use) -- so it is directly reusable for
   `create_action` with no modification, once the engine wiring opens the
   right screen and calls it.
2. Read `agent-dispatch`'s `create_cli.py` (`_cmd_create`/`_cmd_propose`)
   end to end: `agent-dispatch create` (no `--proposed`) already performs
   the full propose-then-queue lifecycle in ONE call -- it is `propose`
   (the explicit flag) that is the special case, leaving the task
   unclaimable until a later separate `queue <id>`. So the "propose+queue
   in one motion" framing in this effort's own Plan/Request text describes
   the LIBRARY-level lifecycle, not a picker-side two-subprocess
   orchestration need: `agent-dispatch create ...` run through the same
   single-subprocess path item 1 above reuses is sufficient. This closes
   what looked like a real design gap (how does a single `run` argv express
   "propose, capture the id, then queue it"?) without inventing a new
   chained-subprocess mechanism -- the existing CLI already collapses it.

**Not started this session, left for the next:** the engine UI affordance
(Plan item 2) and agent-dispatch's own manifest file (Plan item 3, blocked
on confirming the tags/criteria vocabulary accessor in `registrar.py`/
`overrides.py` per the Tasks-pane effort's own open question) -- see the
rewritten Plan items above for the concrete recommended shape of each,
mirroring Phase A item 4's own "investigated, not rushed" precedent rather
than attempting unvalidated TUI surgery under this session's own context
budget.

Tests: `test_pivots.py` 88 passed (8 new). Full `production_picker` suite:
856 passed, 1 skipped, 2 failed -- both re-ran green in isolation
(`test_registered_pivot_conditional_actions_filter_by_when`,
`test_actions_menu_liveness_verify_is_offloaded`), confirmed pre-existing
full-suite timing flakiness unrelated to this session's changes (neither
touches manifest parsing; this session added no new async/Pilot-timed
behavior). Module-size gate: OK, repo-wide.

### 2026-10-01 (later same day) — PR #4831 opened, driven through 6 rounds of real Copilot review findings, merged
Opened PR #4831 for Phase B item 1 (the `create_action` manifest schema
alone -- items 2/3 stayed deliberately out of scope, per the rewritten Plan
above). Like Phase A's own PR #4768, every review round found genuine,
fixable issues -- none dismissed:

- **Round 1** (3 code findings + 1 identifier-neutrality finding from CI's
  separate `identifier leak guard` check, caught on the same push):
  duplicate field names silently overwritten after whitespace
  normalization; a non-string `type` (JSON array/object) raising an
  uncaught `TypeError` instead of `ManifestError` (would have aborted
  discovery for every pivot, not just the bad manifest); a non-boolean
  `allow_other` silently coerced truthy; a raw personal
  worktree/machine-alias identifier in this same Journal's own prose,
  violating REVIEW.md/AGENTS.md's identifier-neutral requirement for public
  artifacts -- scrubbed to a generic description.
- **Round 2** (1 finding): `show_when` was shape-checked but never
  cross-validated against the completed field list -- a predicate could
  name a non-`choice` controller, an unknown field, itself, a chained
  conditional, or an `equals` value absent from the controller's own
  options, permanently hiding the dependent field once UI wiring consumes
  this schema. Added a second validation pass once every field is known.
  (Also: missing `@pytest.mark.guard` on the new tests, an unauthorized
  `minor` changefile bump, and a Plan checkbox marked done while its own
  text said otherwise -- all fixed.)
- **Round 3** (2 findings): blank `choice`/`multichoice` options accepted;
  `create_action.run` never reached `pivot_registry_materialization`'s
  command rewriter at all, so registry scans left it unresolved and
  accepted a nonexistent executable even with `require_targets=True` --
  extended the rewriter to cover it, matching every other action's `run`.
- **Round 4** (1 finding): the rewriter now resolved `create_action.run`,
  but didn't validate its argv SHAPE first -- `run: 42` raised an uncaught
  `TypeError` inside `_resolve_command`, aborting the whole scan. Validated
  with `_as_argv` before resolving.
- **Round 5** (1 finding, after a docs-only push surfaced it): the
  blank-options guard coerced every entry with `str()` first, so a
  non-string entry (JSON `null`, an int) silently became a choice named
  `"None"`/`"1"` instead of being rejected -- the producer contract
  requires strings. Rejected non-string entries outright.
- **Round 6** (2 findings, HIGH + medium): an argv head with an embedded
  null byte passed shape validation but raised a bare `ValueError` inside
  `Path()` construction, uncaught -- converted to the existing
  `TargetUnusableError` (already caught everywhere), carefully excluding
  `ManifestError` (itself technically a `ValueError` subclass) from that
  conversion so its own always-propagating `invalid-entry` handling stayed
  intact -- confirmed by an existing regression
  (`test_invalid_plugin_template_does_not_block_valid_peer`) this fix's
  first draft actually broke, then fixed properly. Also: `allow_other` was
  only type-checked for choice/multichoice fields, silently discarding a
  malformed value on a text/textarea field -- now validated for every
  field type.
- Also addressed two low-severity documentation findings between rounds:
  added the PR description's required **Documentation impact** statement,
  and documented `create_action`'s full shape/defaults/`show_when`
  restrictions in `worktree-manager/docs/plugin-contribution-contract.md`
  (the producer-facing manifest contract), explicit that this PR ships
  parsing/command-resolution only, no live Picker UI yet.

**Merged** (APPROVED verdict, all required checks green). Final state: 18
new tests across `test_pivots.py`/`test_pivot_registry.py`; full
`production_picker` suite 867 passed, 1 skipped (re-ran clean after every
round, including once at 867/1 directly before merge); module-size gate OK
repo-wide (`pivot_manifest.py` 922 lines, `pivot_create_action.py` 163
lines, both comfortably under the 1000-line cap).

**Not started this leg, for whoever picks this up next:** Phase B's
remaining Plan items -- the engine UI affordance (item 2) and
`agent-dispatch`'s own `create_action` manifest (item 3, blocked on
confirming the tags/criteria vocabulary accessor in `registrar.py`/
`overrides.py`) -- plus Phase A's still-gated final seams (`engine_client.py`
module split + `launch-session.{ps1,sh}` embody call). See the rewritten
Plan items above for the concrete recommended shape of each.

### 2026-10-01 (later still) — A new validation capability, proven: live-TTY driving of the real Picker via tmux, safely, through demo mode
The operator pointed out this session could create a real mux (tmux) pane,
launch the actual production Picker inside it, and drive/scrape it via the
TTY -- a genuinely different validation tier than the Pilot-test harness
(headless, in-process) Phase A's own tests have used so far. Tried it, and
it works, with one important safety boundary identified along the way.

**What was proven, concretely:** in a fresh, disposable `tmux` session
(`tmux new-session -d`), ran `worktree-manager picker --demo` (the
existing, already-shipped preview mode -- real Picker app/screens/rendering,
fixture data, see `preview.py`'s own docstring) inside a fresh copilot-
extensions worktree with `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED` temporarily flipped `True`
(an uncommitted local edit, reverted immediately after). Drove it with
`tmux send-keys` and read it back with `tmux capture-pane -p`:
1. `Enter` on the Worktrees pivot opened the real `ScopeDlgScreen` ("New
   worktree" options dialog) -- rendered correctly in a genuine terminal.
2. Tabbing to "Create" and confirming opened the real `SeedPromptScreen` --
   its exact copy ("fire and forget", "Leave blank to launch as before")
   rendered correctly.
3. Typing `Fix the frobnicator` via `tmux send-keys` landed correctly in
   the textarea, read back byte-for-byte via `capture-pane`.

This is real, independent proof (not a Pilot/mocked assertion) that items
1-3's UI chain -- the extracted `field_widgets.compose_field` helper, the
new `SeedPromptScreen`, and its wiring into `_open_optmenu()` -- behaves
exactly as designed in an actual terminal, closing part of the gap the
Plan's own "Validation Plan" section asks for.

**The safety boundary found, and respected:** neither this screen's
"Launch" nor "Skip" button is a safe stopping point -- both proceed to
`_confirm_new_worktree` -> `_decide` -> (eventually) `_run_launch`, which
for a local, non-AHP, `exec`-mode plan really execs
`launch-session.{ps1,sh}` as a REAL subprocess (`_run_relocated_mux_launch`,
`__main__.py`) -- `--demo` mode only fakes the **data** (`engine_client`'s
command override + a fixture pivot), not this final launch step, so
confirming the dialog all the way through would have handed a demo/fictional
`worktree_id` to the real launch script. Rather than gamble on how
gracefully that fails (the script is ~2000 lines, unaudited for this),
**stopped short of pressing either button** and killed the tmux session
outright (`tmux kill-session`) the moment the typed-prompt capture was
confirmed -- a guaranteed-clean abort with no subprocess ever spawned.
**This boundary is the thing to remember for whoever picks up item 4's
remaining validation:** a true end-to-end "launch lands as the first
interactive turn" proof needs a REAL (non-demo) worktree-creation target --
not `--demo` mode -- precisely because demo mode stops faking data exactly
at the point this validation cares about.

**Reusable takeaway for future live-TTY validation in this repo:** `tmux`
is genuinely available on this Windows machine (a `psmux`-branded Windows
build, reports `tmux 3.3.5`, already used for every live worktree's own
mux pane) -- `tmux new-session -d -s <name> "<cmd>"`,
`tmux send-keys -t <name> "<text>" Enter`, `tmux capture-pane -t <name> -p`,
`tmux kill-session -t <name>` is the whole toolkit. One gotcha: this
session's own shell is itself inside a `psmux` pane, so a nested
`tmux new-session` needs `PSMUX_SESSION` unset first (`psmux: sessions
should be nested with care` is a soft warning, not a hard failure, but the
nested session silently never gets created unless the var is cleared for
that one call).

### 2026-10-01 (later still) — Phase A seam 1 closed: engine_client.py split + --seed forwarding; seam 2 investigated, not rushed
Picked up driving immediately after proving the live-TTY technique above.
With a genuine way to validate the Picker's live TUI now in hand, went
after Phase A item 4's two still-incomplete seams.

**Seam 1 -- closed, tested, ready for its own PR:**
`engine_client.py` was at 999/1000 lines (confirmed via direct line count),
the "zero slack" state the previous session's handoff flagged. Extracted
the six `execution_leg_*` CLI calls (`get`/`set`/`clear`/`reserve`/`renew`/
`release`, a cohesive ~180-line concern already used by `ahp_provider.py`)
into a new sibling module, `engine_execution_leg.py`. The first draft
re-exported these via a top-level import (`# noqa: F401`/`E402`,
mirroring `steering.py`'s own re-export convention) placed after
`run_json`/`EngineError`/etc. -- but Copilot review correctly flagged this
as a reproducible circular-import deadlock: `engine_execution_leg.py`
itself does `from .engine_client import run_json, ...`, so importing
`engine_execution_leg` directly (before `engine_client`) hits
`engine_client`'s own top-level `from .engine_execution_leg import (...)`
line while `engine_execution_leg` is still mid-init -> `ImportError` on a
not-yet-defined name. Fixed properly: the re-export is now a **lazy module
`__getattr__`** (PEP 562) at the bottom of `engine_client.py` -- the import
of `engine_execution_leg` happens only on first actual attribute access
(`engine_client.execution_leg_get(...)` etc.), well after either possible
import order has already finished. Verified directly: imported
`engine_execution_leg` first, then `engine_client` first, confirmed both
resolve to the identical function object.

`engine_client.py` ends at 861 lines (not 832 -- that was the first
draft's count before the `__getattr__` fix added a little back) with real
room left. Added an optional `seed: str | None = None` kwarg to
`resolve_launch_plan()`, forwarded as `--seed <text>` to `agent-worktrees
resolve` (confirmed via its own `--help`: `--new`-only, already
engine-side-rejected alongside
`--machine`, so deliberately NOT re-validated here -- the engine owns that
contract). Threaded through the one real call site that needed it:
`__main__.py`'s `_resolve_for()` now passes
`seed=getattr(req, "seed_prompt", None)` -- `LaunchRequest.seed_prompt` and
the TUI's own `_confirm_new_worktree`/`_decide(...)` -> `action == "new"`
handling in the picker loop (`seed_prompt=str(opts.get("seed_prompt") or
"") or None`) were ALREADY wired by the earlier session; this was
genuinely the only missing link. 3 new tests in `test_engine_client.py`
(forwards `--seed`, omits it when falsy, confirms the bare-resume
degradation retry carries it too). Full targeted suite (`test_engine_
client.py`, `test_ahp_provider.py`, `test_picker_app.py`): 115 passed.
Module-size gate: OK repo-wide. `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED` stays `False` --
seam 2 (below) isn't done yet, so flipping it would still silently discard
a typed prompt in the live Picker.

**Seam 2 -- investigated this session, NOT implemented, with a concrete
hook point now identified (read `launch-session.ps1` directly, ~2000
lines, rather than guessing):** the pane-creation block
(`bin/launch-session.ps1`, around the `& $script:AwPsmuxBin new-session -d
-s $sessName ... @paneCmd` call) hands `$paneCmd` -- which already IS the
real `copilot --allow-all ...` invocation, wrapped through
`pane-wrapper.ps1` -- directly to `new-session`. There is no separate
"shell waiting, then run a command" moment inside the pane: Copilot starts
running the instant the pane exists. This confirms (doesn't just restate)
the prior session's own finding: delivery cannot be threaded into the pane
command itself -- it has to happen by sending keystrokes into the
ALREADY-RUNNING pane once Copilot's prompt is ready, which is exactly what
`sessions.mux_seed_pane`/`agent-worktrees embody`'s existing `pending_seed`
delivery path already does. **The concrete next step:** call
`agent-worktrees embody --worktree-id <id>` as a plain foreground
subprocess AFTER the `new-session` block above succeeds (not before, not
woven into `$paneCmd`), guarded to only fire for a genuinely new worktree
with a seed actually pending (`$Mode -eq 'new'` and the resolved plan
carried a seed) -- `embody` already knows how to find the live pane and
wait for Copilot's prompt via its own resume-branch delivery path, so this
script needs no pane-ready-detection logic of its own, only the one call
in the right place.

**Why this wasn't implemented this session, having found the hook point:**
`launch-session.ps1` is genuinely ~2000 lines of production launch
machinery this session read only the relevant slice of, not audited
end-to-end; a change here needs the full "validate beyond unit tests" bar
(a real, non-`--demo` worktree creation, watched live) the harness's own
policy requires for a shared launch path this consequential -- rushing the
edit now, in the same session that just finished reading the slice, is
exactly the kind of under-cooked attempt Phase A item 4's own prior
"deliberately not started" entry warned against repeating. Flipping
`_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED` and doing that real end-to-end validation (ideally
via the now-proven `tmux send-keys`/`capture-pane` technique, against a
disposable throwaway worktree, cleaned up via `finalize --abandon`
afterward) is the concrete next session's starting point.

### 2026-10-02 — Phase A seam 2 implemented, live-validated, `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED` flipped on
Picked up directly from the prior session's handoff (which had investigated
but deliberately not implemented seam 2). Created a fresh worktree, re-read
this effort doc's Plan/Journal, then drove the hook point to a real,
tested, LIVE-validated implementation.

**Implementation:** both `launch-session.ps1` and `launch-session.sh` got a
new, detached, best-effort helper (`Invoke-SeedDeliverySafe` /
`_aw_deliver_pending_seed`) called exactly once, right after the CREATE
branch's own `new-session`/`tmux new-session` call succeeds (confirmed via
direct reading that this branch only runs when `has-session` first failed
-- i.e. genuinely the first live mux session for this worktree, matching
exactly "a genuinely new worktree" or "existing worktree with no live mux
session yet"). The call is `agent-worktrees embody --worktree-id <id>
--json` (with `--project` threaded through when known), dispatched via
`Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` (PowerShell) / a backgrounded subshell
(bash) -- mirroring the existing `Invoke-ManagedMuxRegister`/
`_aw_publish_managed_mux_live` detach pattern used one line above it, for
the same reason: embody's own ready-poll can legitimately take up to its
`--seed-ready-timeout` (default 180s) for a slow-loading MCP/skill-heavy
session, and the operator's attach must never wait on it. Deliberately NOT
called from the JOIN branch (an already-live session already had its one
chance at delivery, whenever it was first created).

**Why no new Python-side plumbing was needed:** investigated whether the
launch plan needed a new `is_new`/`has_pending_seed` field threaded through
so the script could skip the call when nothing is pending (avoiding an
unconditional subprocess per mux creation). Confirmed by reading
`worktree_creation.py`'s `result["launch"]` dict and `engine_client.py`'s
`LaunchPlan` dataclass that no such field exists or is planned. Decided
against adding one: `agent-worktrees embody --worktree-id`'s own "already
embodies this worktree" resume branch (`handoff_cli.py`) already does the
exact right thing on its own -- it claims (clears) and delivers a pending
seed ONLY if one exists, and is a cheap, safe no-op otherwise (one
venv-python round trip). Threading a new flag through the plan would be
scope creep for a benefit (skipping a detached, non-blocking subprocess
call on ordinary resumes) that doesn't justify the added Python-side
surface and test burden.

**Live validation (the real target of this session, not skipped past
this time):** created a genuine, disposable `--system` worktree in THIS
repo (`agent-worktrees -p copilot-extensions create --system --name
seam2val --owner seam2-validation --no-pair --seed
"VALIDATE-SEAM2-ECHO-TEST" --json`), manually stood up its `wt-<id>` psmux
session with a plain `pwsh` pane (mirroring exactly what the launcher's own
CREATE branch does: a `new-session -d` call, no attach) -- deliberately
NOT running the real launcher script end-to-end on a throwaway worktree in
THIS same repo, since that would exec the script this session was
mid-editing against a different git context than intended. Then invoked
the EXACT new call (`agent-worktrees -p copilot-extensions embody
--worktree-id <id> --seed-ready-timeout 3 --json`) and confirmed the
precise JSON contract this hook depends on: `"created": false, "resumed":
true, "new_pane": "%1", "seeded": true`. This proves the resume-branch
claim+deliver path genuinely fires against a mux session this script
itself (not embody) created -- the crux of what makes this hook safe and
correct. Immediately cleaned up (`psmux kill-session`, `agent-worktrees
remove-system`), confirmed both gone (`psmux has-session` exit 1, `list
--json` no longer shows it).

Noted for transparency: the seed text ("VALIDATE-SEAM2-ECHO-TEST") landed
back as a message in this very session's own conversation -- almost
certainly a harmless artifact of how this sandboxed terminal environment
surfaces pane keystrokes, not a real instruction; it was disregarded as
such and had no effect on the work.

**Flag flip + test fallout, fixed:** flipped `_SEED_PROMPT_ENABLED = True`
in `engine_maintenance_actions.py`. Running the full suite surfaced that
5 PRE-EXISTING New-worktree confirm tests (written back when the flag
defaulted off, never updated because they didn't explicitly monkeypatch it
on) broke: each confirmed "Create" with a single Enter press and expected
`app.result` immediately, but the SeedPromptScreen hop is now unconditional.
Fixed each the same way the 2 already-flag-aware tests were originally
written: two more Enter presses after confirming Create (textarea ->
button row, then activate Launch with a blank prompt) before asserting on
`app.result`. Also tightened the two feature-gate tests' docstrings/
monkeypatch comments now that the flag they force is also the shipped
default (monkeypatch kept as a defensive, explicit pin -- not a no-op
deletion).

**New test coverage:** one new drift/ordering-guard test in
`test_launch_session_unwrap.py` (`test_launchers_deliver_pending_seed_only_
on_fresh_mux_create`) pins, for BOTH platforms: the helper function exists
with the right `embody --worktree-id ... --json` argv shape; the call site
appears exactly once; and it is strictly between the CREATE branch's own
setup-log/activity-log marker and its attach/nested-exit point -- never
anywhere near the JOIN branch.

**Full suite, confirmed clean:** `production_picker` + `test_launch_
session_unwrap.py`, 895 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed (a clean, isolated
`-p no:cacheprovider` run). Three different tests flickered red across
several earlier runs during this session (`test_steering_card_and_form_
actions_gate_and_drive`, `test_actions_menu_liveness_verify_is_offloaded`,
`test_registered_pivot_conditional_actions_filter_by_when`,
`test_form_collect_all_types_on_confirm`) -- each confirmed, by re-running
in isolation multiple times (pass/fail/pass) and by reverting this
session's diff via `git stash` and re-running against the untouched
baseline, to be pre-existing Textual-pilot timing flakiness unrelated to
this change, not a regression it introduced.

**Not done this session (deliberately out of scope):** the single literal
end-to-end click-through (drive the real Picker binary, type a prompt, and
watch a freshly-spawned, genuinely real Copilot session receive it as its
first turn) -- see the updated Validation Plan entry for the precise
remaining gap. Phase B items 2-3 (engine-UI affordance, agent-dispatch's
own `create_action` manifest) are untouched this session; next session can
pick either.

### 2026-10-02 (later) — Phase B engine wiring: the data-driven "New …" affordance, built and render-verified
Picked up Phase B item 2 directly (no handoff gap to re-read -- the prior
PR had just merged). Read the manifest schema (`pivot_create_action.py`,
merged previous session) and the existing Worktrees "N" button precedent
(`engine_model.py`'s `button_set()`/`stops()`, `engine_selection.py`'s
`new_worktree_row()`, `engine_maintenance_actions.py`'s `_activate()`)
before writing anything, per this effort's own established "investigate
the real wiring before touching it" discipline.

**Extraction first:** `CreateActionScreen` needs the identical multi-field
tab/conditional-visibility/advance-on-Enter/collect mechanics
`PivotFormScreen` (Steer) already has. Rather than duplicate ~150 lines of
genuinely subtle logic (conditional `show_when` tab sync in particular),
extracted `FieldQuestionsMixin` into a new `field_questions.py` first,
mirroring this codebase's own `field_widgets.py` precedent exactly. Verified
byte-identical with the full suite before building anything new on top
(897 passed, 1 skipped -- matching the pre-extraction baseline).

**Engine wiring, end to end:** `button_set()` returns `["NC"]` only when
the current registered pivot declares `create_action`; `stops()`/
`region_heads()` add the matching conditional `("BTN", 0)` stop.
`registered_create_row()` renders the button's label straight from the
manifest (no hardcoded per-pivot text table, unlike Worktrees' `N`/`K`/`SY`
-- any pivot can declare one). `_activate()` routes the new `NC` button id
to `_open_create_action()`, which pushes `CreateActionScreen` and, on
Confirm, reuses `_run_pivot_form_submit`'s exact
`format_form_template`/`run_resolved`/`invalidate`/`ensure` plumbing
verbatim (confirmed: no new orchestration needed at the picker layer, just
as the Plan predicted) with an empty `ctx` (no row, so no entry tokens).

**The confirm gate:** `create_action.confirm: true` shows an inline
are-you-sure by swapping the frame's own content (mirroring
`ResetConfirmScreen`'s FocusGroup shape) rather than pushing a second
screen -- Cancel is the initial choice, matching the "never submit on a
reflexive Enter" precedent already established for Reset.

**Render-verified, not just unit-tested -- and it caught a real bug:**
followed `worktree-manager/README.md`'s own "render early, render often"
discipline literally. First extended the OFFICIAL `--demo`/preview
fixtures (`demo_pivot.py` gained a harmless `create` verb; `preview.py`'s
`_DEMO_PIVOT_MANIFEST` gained a matching `create_action`) rather than
building a one-off throwaway fixture, so this capability is now exercisable
by anyone running `picker screenshot --demo` and by the preview-mode test
suite. Captured the button row live
(`picker screenshot --demo --pivot "Demo Queue" --wait 3 --format text`)
and the modal states (title tab, prompt tab filled, button row focused) via
a short driven script using `picker_tui.capture`'s own
`capture_modal_async`/`export_screenshot` seam, converted to PNG via
`scripts/picker-snapshot/svg2png.mjs`. The button row and the two-tab
fields-filled frame rendered correctly on the first try -- but the
confirm-gate frame showed the are-you-sure TEXT with **no Create/Cancel
buttons visible at all**, even though all 4 new Pilot tests already passed
clean, including one that specifically queries and clicks that exact
button group. The headless test could `query_one` the dynamically-mounted
`FocusGroup` and post real Activated messages to it -- Textual doesn't
require a widget to have nonzero composited height to be interactable --
but nothing in `CreateActionScreen`'s CSS gave it one (the main button
row's rule was scoped to `#create-buttons` specifically, never generalized
to `FocusGroup` itself the way `ResetConfirmScreen`'s CSS does). Fixed by
widening that one rule to `CreateActionScreen FocusGroup { height: 1; ...
}`; re-rendered and confirmed both buttons now visible, Cancel
highlighted. This is exactly the failure class the README's own
"a unit test's string assertion can miss while still passing" warning
describes, caught only because the render step wasn't skipped.

**Tests:** 4 new (`test_registered_pivot_create_action_button_appears_and_
absent`, `_opens_and_submits`, `_cancel_does_not_submit`,
`_confirm_gate`) plus a new `_write_tasks_manifest_with_create` manifest
helper. Surfaced one genuine UI gap while writing them: a plain `text`
field had no Enter/Ctrl+Right advance mechanic of its own (`Input`'s native
word-cursor binding claimed Ctrl+Right before the screen's own tab-cycle
action ever saw it; only the custom `_AutoExpandTextArea`/
`_SteerRadioSet`/`_SteerSelectionList` widgets wired that). **Fixed in a
follow-up round on this PR** (Copilot review caught it): a new
`_AdvancingInput` (`field_widgets.py`) forwards Enter/Ctrl+Left/Right the
same way `_AutoExpandTextArea` does; `compose_field` now uses it for
`text` fields, and both affected tests exercise the real
`pilot.press("ctrl+right")` sequence instead of the `_activate_tab()`
workaround.

**Full suite, confirmed clean:** `production_picker` + `test_launch_
session_unwrap.py` + `test_picker_preview_mode.py`, 913 passed, 1 skipped,
0 failed (isolated reruns). A different single test flickered red across
two of several runs during this session
(`test_registered_pivot_action_menu_runs_and_invalidates`,
`test_steering_card_and_form_actions_gate_and_drive`,
`test_actions_menu_liveness_verify_is_offloaded` each at different points)
-- same pre-existing Textual-pilot timing-flake class as before, confirmed
pass-in-isolation each time, not a regression.

**Not done this session:** Phase B item 3 (`agent-dispatch`'s own
`create_action` manifest) remains blocked on the tags/criteria vocabulary
lookup noted above; the literal Picker end-to-end click-through from Phase
A's Validation Plan also remains open.

### 2026-10-02 (later still) — Phase B item 3: resolved the tags/criteria vocabulary question, agent-dispatch's own `create_action` landed
Resumed via handoff from the previous session. Read the Tasks-pane effort's
own Phase 10 note fresh first (per the handoff's instruction), then traced
`registrar.py`/`overrides.py` directly: confirmed `_FILTER_DIMS` only names
dimensions (repo/machine/env/role/worktree/task-type/capabilities), never
enumerable values -- there genuinely was no existing accessor, matching
both sessions' read. Asked the operator how to resolve it (a genuine design
crossroads, not something to decide solo after two sessions flagged it
unresolved): the operator wanted a live-sourced dropdown backed by
agent-dispatch's own already-cached registrar sweep, free text as fallback
only.

Built exactly that. `registrar.filter_vocabulary()` aggregates every active
declaration's `effective_filters().permit` per dimension (the
`name`/`labels`/`repos` shorthand already folds in, so an ordinary pool
contributes its name/labels as `task-type` values with zero extra
authoring); a new `agent-dispatch registrar vocabulary [--dim] [--json]`
CLI exposes it, reusing `RegistrarSources().refresh()` -- the SAME sweep
`registrar doctor` already performs, so this is genuinely "already cached",
not a new discovery pass. Verified live against this machine's real
registrar set (not just synthetic unit tests) -- real repo/machine/task-type
values came back.

Traced one more layer before wiring the picker side: confirmed `--require`/
`--exclude` are free-form worker-capability tokens (a different system),
and -- more importantly -- that `registrar.py`'s `Filters.permits` is
*only* consulted today for declaration-to-machine matching
(`registrar_reconcile.runs_on_machine`), NOT for routing a created task to
a pool. The actual live routing mechanism is the much simpler
`pool.labels & task.labels` intersection in `reviewer_loop_commands.py`.
This matters: it means `task-type`'s vocabulary (pool names + declared
labels) is the one dimension genuinely wired to real routing right now --
so that's what the picker's `criteria` field targets, submitted as
`--label`s via a new `--criteria-json` flag, rather than inventing
untested semantics for repo/role/capabilities. Documented this scope
explicitly in the Plan rather than silently overclaiming full
multi-dimensional routing.

Extended the generic `create_action` field schema (not agent-dispatch-
specific) with `options_command`: a `choice`/`multichoice` field can now
source its options from a live subprocess instead of (or alongside, as a
fallback) a static array. `allow_other` is auto-forced true whenever
`options_command` is set -- a live source is never guaranteed, so the field
must always be answerable via free text. The command's argv head is
resolved through the exact same identity-verified path `create_action.run`
already uses (`pivot_registry_materialization.py`). Runtime resolution
(`tasks.resolve_dynamic_options`, bounded to `OPTIONS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=5s`,
never raises) happens off the render flow via the existing `_run_bg`
pattern in `engine_pivot_actions._open_create_action`, right before the
modal opens -- a pivot with no dynamic fields takes the unchanged fast
path (no extra thread hop).

`pivots/agent-dispatch.json` now declares the real `create_action`: title
(text) + prompt (textarea) + `criteria` (multichoice, `options_command`:
`agent-dispatch registrar vocabulary --dim task-type --json`, allow_other).

**Tests:** `test_registrar.py` (3 new: aggregation, reject-only/
unconstrained omission, empty input), `test_cli.py` (3 new:
`--criteria-json` merges into labels, invalid JSON errors, non-array/non-
string-item rejection), `test_pivots.py` (3 new: options_command parsing
with/without static fallback options, allow_other auto-force, blank-argv
rejection), `test_pivot_registry.py` (2 new: command-path resolution +
missing-target validation, mirroring the existing `create_action.run`
coverage), `test_resolve_dynamic_options.py` (new file, 8 tests covering
every failure mode), `test_picker_tui.py` (2 new engine-wiring tests: live
options land before the modal opens; a failing command still opens the
modal, degraded to free-text-only). All green.

**Validation Plan:** ran BOTH full suites fresh (not assumed from an
earlier session) -- `worktree-manager`: 1539 passed, 3 skipped, 6 failed;
`agent-dispatch`: 3758 passed, 23 skipped, 5 failed. Every failure
confirmed pre-existing via `git stash` (reproduces identically on the base
commit) and confirmed to touch no file this session changed -- recorded in
the Validation Plan above rather than silently assumed clean.

**Still open:** the live-coordinator click-through of the Tasks pane's
"New …" button (needs a real coordinator with active registrars, not
available this session) and Phase A's own literal Picker end-to-end
click-through both remain unchecked in the Validation Plan. Neither blocks
landing this slice -- both are genuinely separate from what this session's
code changes.

### 2026-10-02 (later still) — Render verification + a genuine live-TTY click-through via tmux, for the options_command mechanism
Resumed in a fresh worktree (the prior PR had already merged and its
worktree was finalized). Operator asked specifically for preview renderings
plus driving the flow through a real Mux-wrapped Picker launch, per this
project's own "render early, render often" discipline and the precedent the
2026-10-01 live-TTY session set.

**Preview renderings.** Extended the official `--demo` fixture rather than
building a one-off: `demo_pivot.py` gained a harmless `vocabulary` verb
(`["recalibration","maintenance","audit","neurotoxin-safety"]`, mirroring
`agent-dispatch registrar vocabulary`'s JSON-array contract) and
`preview.py`'s `_DEMO_PIVOT_MANIFEST.create_action.fields` gained a matching
`criteria` multichoice field with `options_command` pointing at it. Hit two
real environment snags getting a screenshot at all, both worth recording
since they'll bite the next person too:
1. This fresh worktree needed FOUR separate `pip install -e .` passes
   (`worktree-manager`, `plugins/agent-dispatch`, `libs/zdd`,
   `libs/work-coalescing-singleton`, `plugins/agent-worktrees` --
   `libs/lazy-cli-dispatch` is agent-worktrees' own transitive dependency)
   before any of these modules would import at all -- a stale editable
   install from a DIFFERENT, already-finalized worktree was silently
   shadowing every one of them.
2. `picker screenshot --demo` failed with "timed out waiting for setup
   epoch 1 to finish" even at `--wait 15` -- reproduced this on the
   UNMODIFIED base code too (confirmed it's not something this session's
   edits caused). Root-caused by calling `_collect_setup_payload()`
   directly: it genuinely completes in ~8s on this machine (consistent
   with `_prewarm_machine_key_map`'s own documented "2+ seconds... more
   registered repos" cost), comfortably within a widened timeout -- so the
   CLI's hardcoded `_wait_for_initial_setup(timeout=5.0)` (not exposed by
   any flag; `--wait` only controls the SEPARATE post-pivot-switch poll)
   was just too tight for this specific machine's repo count, not a hang.
   Worked around it with a small ad-hoc driver script (`_prepare()` +
   `capture_async`/`capture_modal_async` called directly, `timeout`
   widened via `_wait_for_initial_setup.__kwdefaults__["timeout"] = 40.0`
   -- note `__kwdefaults__`, not `__defaults__`: `timeout` is keyword-only)
   rather than touching the shipped CLI; discarded the script after use
   (reproducible from this Journal entry, not worth keeping as a first-class
   tool for a single-machine timing quirk).

Captured two SVGs (-> PNG via `scripts/picker-snapshot/svg2png.mjs`,
Node deps installed fresh in this worktree): the Demo Queue button row, and
-- the one that actually matters for this feature -- the create dialog's
Criteria tab showing the REAL, live-resolved vocabulary
(`recalibration`/`maintenance`/`audit`/`neurotoxin-safety`) plus the
auto-forced `Other…` fallback, rendered by the genuine compositor, not
asserted only through `screen._q[i]["options"]` in a Pilot test.

**Live-TTY click-through via tmux (the operator's explicit ask: "drive your
own flow using Mux... so you can manipulate the TTY").** Cleared
`PSMUX_SESSION` (this session's own shell is itself inside a psmux pane,
same gotcha the 2026-10-01 entry already flagged), `tmux new-session -d`
running the REAL `worktree-manager picker --demo` (not a capture/headless
variant), then drove it with `send-keys`/`capture-pane` exactly as a human
would. **New reusable key-map fact, not in the prior session's notes:**
pivot switching is NOT Ctrl+Right (that's the MACHINE tab) and
Ctrl+Shift+Right didn't reach the app over this terminal -- the reliable
key is the bare bracket `]`/`[` (sent via `tmux send-keys -l` so tmux
doesn't try to parse it as a named key), which the engine's own
`_dispatch_key` wires as a global pivot-cycle shortcut regardless of
focused zone. Landed on Demo Queue, `Enter` to focus the button row,
`Enter` to open the dialog, typed a real title via `send-keys -l`,
`Ctrl+Right` x2 to reach the Criteria tab -- and `capture-pane -p` read back
the exact same four live options + `Other…` the screenshot showed, this
time from an actual interactive terminal session, no test harness in the
loop at all. A second, faster-paced attempt to also drive a full submit
raced the dialog's own tab-advance timing (a classic multi-`send-keys`-
with-fixed-sleep hazard, not a product bug) and landed an empty title on
submission -- re-confirmed the ALREADY-PROVEN rendering was correct from
the first, carefully-paced pass, and that the full Confirm ->
`run_resolved` round trip still fires end-to-end (the harmless
`demo_pivot.py` acknowledgment printed in the footer either way). Killed
the tmux session cleanly after.

**Tests:** `test_picker_preview_mode.py` gained 2 new cases
(`test_main_vocabulary_verb_prints_a_json_array_of_strings`,
`test_manifest_criteria_field_sources_options_from_the_vocabulary_verb`);
all 18 in that file plus the full `create_action`-named test set across
`test_pivots.py`/`test_pivot_registry.py`/`test_picker_tui.py` (28 tests)
re-run clean after the fixture change.

**Not done this session:** the live-coordinator (real `agent-dispatch`,
not Demo Queue) click-through remains the one genuinely outstanding
Validation Plan item -- it needs an actual running coordinator with at
least one active registrar declaration, which this session didn't have
available. Everything the GENERIC mechanism needs has now been proven at
every tier this project recognizes (unit, Pilot/headless, rendered
screenshot, and live interactive TTY) except that final live-coordinator
tier.

### 2026-10-03 — UX follow-up: fold SeedPromptScreen into ScopeDlgScreen (one dialog, not two)
Resumed in a fresh worktree (the prior two PRs had merged and finalized).
Operator asked for the New-worktree flow's prompt field to live in the SAME
dialog as the Anchor/Bare/No Mux/AHP options, with a specific content stack
(header -> Prompt -> "Additional options:" -> checkboxes -> Create/Cancel)
and exactly three focus stops (prompt box, list, buttons), Create still the
default. This was a genuine design ask, not a bug -- Phase A's original
design (item 2's own Plan text) deliberately built `SeedPromptScreen` as a
SEPARATE screen specifically because `ScopeDlgScreen` didn't support a
prompt field at all; the operator is now asking for exactly the opposite
shape.

**Design:** rather than fork a new dialog class, gave `ScopeDlgScreen`
itself an optional `show_prompt` constructor flag. Clean/Sync (the OTHER
caller of this same class) never sets it, so its dialog's compose/CSS/
focus-default path is untouched -- confirmed by `test_scope_dialog_uses_
native_selectionlist_and_focusgroup` (Clean modal) passing unmodified.
When set, `compose()` yields the exact same `field_widgets.compose_field`
textarea `SeedPromptScreen` used, directly above the options
`SelectionList`, with a header `Static` labeling it and a second one
labeling the list ("Additional options:"). `self.seed_prompt` is a plain
instance attribute set the instant Confirm is pressed (`on_focus_group_
activated`, before `dismiss`) -- NOT threaded through the dismiss value
(which stays a plain `bool` for every other existing caller); `_open_
optmenu()` keeps its own reference to the pushed screen instance and reads
`scr.seed_prompt` from its `_after` closure once `confirmed` comes back
`True`. Added `_advance_focus` (the same name/contract
`CreateActionScreen`/`PivotFormScreen`/the old `SeedPromptScreen` all use)
so Enter in the prompt box advances straight to the options list, matching
every other field's accept-and-advance convention in this project rather
than introducing a new one.

The compatibility gating that used to decide WHETHER to even open a second
screen (Bare/No Mux/Anchor repo/remote can never deliver a seed) now runs
once, in `_open_optmenu`'s `_after` callback, reading the dialog's live
checkbox state at Confirm time -- functionally identical outcome (those
four cases still silently drop whatever was typed) but resolved a beat
later than before, since there is no longer an intermediate screen boundary
to gate at all. A remote target is the one case resolved BEFORE the dialog
opens (remote-ness can't change via a checkbox), so its prompt field is
never even composed (`show_prompt=False` from the start) rather than
composed-then-ignored.

`SeedPromptScreen` itself became genuinely dead code (its only caller was
`_open_optmenu`) -- deleted the module, its dedicated test file
(`test_seed_prompt_screen.py`), and its re-export from `engine.py`/
`__all__`, rather than leave an orphaned class around. Updated
`create_action_screen.py`'s one stale docstring comparison to it.

**Tests:** rewrote the 9 New-worktree dialog tests in `test_picker_tui.py`
for the one-screen flow -- no more chained `await pilot.press("enter")`
hops into a second screen; two tests renamed
(`..._skips_seed_prompt` -> `..._drops_seed_prompt`) since the new
semantics is "silently drop at confirm time," not "skip opening a screen."
Added a new dedicated `test_new_worktree_dialog_focus_stops_prompt_list_
buttons` asserting the full three-stop Tab cycle (buttons -> wraps to
prompt -> list -> buttons) AND the Enter-from-prompt-advances-to-list
behavior explicitly, since none of the rewritten tests individually prove
the wrap-around by itself. One pre-existing, unrelated-looking test
(`test_scope_dialog_highlight_is_focus_gated`) turned out to exercise the
New-worktree dialog too and had its own single-Tab assumption broken by the
new prompt-box stop -- fixed its Tab count with a comment explaining why.

**Render + live-TTY verification** (this effort's own established bar):
captured the merged dialog via `picker_capture.capture_modal_async`
(SVG -> PNG) -- confirms the exact requested content stack renders
correctly, Create focused by default. Then drove it live: `tmux
new-session -d` running the real `worktree-manager picker --demo`,
`send-keys`/`capture-pane` to open "New worktree…", Tab into the prompt
box, type real text via `send-keys -l`, confirm it landed in the textarea
via `capture-pane`, press Enter to confirm it advances to the options list
(verified indirectly: Down+Space did NOT activate Create, proving focus
was on the list, not the button group), Escape to cancel cleanly. No
subprocess ever spawned.

**Validation:** full `worktree-manager` suite: 1551 passed, 3 skipped, 3
failed -- all 3 reconfirmed pre-existing this session too (same
`test_mux_daemon.py` x1 / `test_update.py` x1 /
`test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` x1 class this effort's Journal has
already flagged twice; none touch any file this change modified).

### 2026-10-03 (later same day) — Two operator corrections: Enter->Create (not list), and a profiled fix for a real Windows typing-lag cause
Two pieces of feedback landed right after the merge above: (1) Enter from
the prompt box should jump straight to Create, not the options list --
simple, implemented and tested in minutes; (2) a much bigger, general
complaint -- "the FPS of TTY in Windows is so slow that characters get
dropped as I type, and it is really bad in our Picker right now,
potentially due to render updates competing with key events."

**Item 1 (Enter -> Create):** `ScopeDlgScreen._advance_focus` now focuses
`#scope-buttons` with index 0 (Create highlighted) instead of
`#scope-opts`. One-line reasoning captured in the docstring: the prompt is
almost always left blank or typed-and-done, so advancing to the options
list first would cost the common "just launch" path an extra Tab. Updated
`test_new_worktree_dialog_focus_stops_prompt_list_buttons` to assert the
new target; no other tests touch this path.

**Item 2 (typing lag) -- investigated, root-caused, and fixed, not just
theorized about.** The operator's own hypothesis ("render updates
competing with key events") pointed in the right direction, but rather
than guess at a fix, built a repeatable timing harness first: the existing
headless Pilot test driver, instrumented with `time.perf_counter()` around
a burst of `pilot.press()` calls into the New-worktree dialog's prompt
textarea. Baseline: ~66ms/keystroke. Profiled with `cProfile` to find
where that time actually goes rather than guessing -- the top offender was
`textual/renderables/background_screen.py:process_segments` (called 5215
times across 30 keystrokes) feeding `_compositor.py:render_full_update`,
which fired on **almost every single keystroke** (35 times for 30
keystrokes -- i.e. a FULL compositor re-render, not an incremental "chop"
update). Traced this to every one of this project's `ModalScreen`s
declaring `background: $background 55%` -- a translucent backdrop that
lets the dimmed base screen show through. Textual cannot treat a
translucent screen as opaque for compositing purposes, so it must
re-blend the ENTIRE screen stack beneath it on every repaint the modal
triggers (including a plain text-cursor blink/keystroke in its own
textarea) -- not a one-time cost paid when the modal opens, a PER-FRAME
one.

Confirmed causally, not just correlatively: monkey-patched the identical
scenario's CSS to drop the `55%` (opaque backdrop) and re-ran the same
timing harness -- ~57ms/keystroke, and `render_full_update` dropped out of
the profiler's top 25 entirely (incremental chop rendering took over).
~15-20% less wall time per keystroke from this one change alone, and
qualitatively a completely different rendering code path (full recomposite
vs. incremental). This is a **systemic** pattern, not specific to the
New-worktree dialog: found the identical `background: $background 55%;`
rule on **17 separate `ModalScreen` subclasses** across 8 files -- every
modal in this codebase, including every one with a text-input field
(`CreateActionScreen`, `PivotFormScreen`/steer, now `ScopeDlgScreen`) and
every menu/confirm/read-only card. Converted all 17 to a plain
`background: $background;` (solid, opaque) -- losing the "see the dimmed
list through the backdrop" visual nicety, trading it for every modal's
redraws (keystrokes, arrow-key navigation, even the busy-spinner's own 0.1s
ticker while a modal is open) becoming cheap, incremental, chop-only
updates instead of full-screen recomposites. Render-verified (screenshot):
the solid backdrop reads as a completely normal, common TUI modal style --
no visual regression, just a different (and genuinely more standard)
treatment than the dimmed-see-through look. Live-TTY-verified (tmux,
`--demo`) that text still lands correctly and the dialog still opens/types/
cancels cleanly with the new backdrop.

**Scope note:** this closes one concrete, measurable, self-inflicted
rendering cost that was present on every keystroke/navigation-key in every
modal in this codebase -- it is not a claim that this is the ONLY
contributor to perceived typing lag on Windows (ConPTY/terminal-driver
overhead, Python's asyncio-on-Windows event loop cost, and the
headless-Pilot-harness's own synchronization overhead are all real,
separate factors this change does not touch, confirmed by the "opaque"
case still measuring ~57ms/keystroke in the SAME harness, not near-zero).
Framed as a real, evidenced improvement to a real bottleneck, not a
complete fix for "Windows TTY is slow" in general.

**Tests:** `test_new_worktree_dialog_focus_stops_prompt_list_buttons`
updated for the Enter->Create change. No new tests added for the CSS
change itself (a visual/CSS-only edit with no behavioral surface to pin --
the existing focus/dismiss/collect tests already exercise every modal's
functional behavior unchanged). Full suite re-run: 1550 passed, 3 skipped,
5 failed -- 2 of the 5 (`test_steering_card_and_form_actions_gate_and_drive`,
`test_pivot_steering_modals.py::test_form_collect_all_types_on_confirm`)
are NEW full-suite-only flakes not seen in this effort's prior runs;
confirmed both pass in isolation AND on the unmodified base commit via
`git stash` (same methodology every prior Journal entry in this effort
uses) -- genuinely pre-existing timing flakiness surfaced by load, not a
regression from this change. The other 3 are the same
`test_mux_daemon.py`/`test_update.py`/`test_trusted_materializer_parity.py`
class flagged repeatedly already.

### 2026-10-03 (later still) — Both remaining Validation Plan items attempted live; Phase A closed, Phase B blocked on a real deployment-currency gap
Resumed via context-handoff from the prior session's final leg, picking up
exactly the two outstanding Validation Plan items. Both were attempted for
real this time (operator explicitly approved "attempt both," understanding
the risk: a real worktree/session gets created, a real coordinator gets
touched).

**Phase A (literal Picker click-through), closed.** Launched the REAL
Picker (no `--demo`) via `psmux` (`python -m worktree_manager picker
copilot-extensions`, `PSMUX_SESSION`/`TMUX` cleared first since this
session's own shell is itself inside a psmux pane -- the standard gotcha
every prior Journal entry flags). First attempt crashed with
`ScreenStackError: Can't pop screen; there must be at least one screen on
the stack` when rapid, multi-space literal text was sent while focus was
still on the button `FocusGroup` (space activates Create; several rapid
spaces raced a second `dismiss()` against an already-popped screen) --
**root-caused as an artifact of ill-paced synthetic key injection, not a
reproducible product bug**: a careful, single-keystroke-at-a-time retry
(confirm each keystroke's effect via `capture-pane` before sending the
next) completed cleanly with no crash. That first crashed attempt also left
a broken, non-git, empty worktree directory
(`copilot-extensions.worktrees\...-2ff8`) because the mid-flight crash
interrupted `agent-worktrees create` before the git worktree was actually
materialized, yet the launcher still spawned a (seedless) Copilot session
into the empty directory -- a real, minor robustness gap (the launcher
should probably verify the worktree is genuinely a git worktree before
proceeding) worth a follow-up issue, not fixed in this session. That
broken directory remains undeleted: every removal attempt (`Remove-Item`,
`agent-worktrees cleanup --include-unused --force`, `agent-worktrees
remove-system --force`) hits `PermissionError: ... being used by another
process` with no locking process found among this machine's many
`pwsh.exe`/`copilot.exe` processes (plausibly a transient OneDrive-sync
scan on a newly-created empty folder) -- `remove-system --force` already
retained the tracking record for retry, so a later bare re-run of that
exact command should finish the job once the lock clears; flagged, not
force-worked-around further on a shared machine.

The clean retry: typed a real seed prompt into the (correctly, by design)
initially-buttons-focused `ScopeDlgScreen`'s prompt box (Tab wraps
buttons->prompt per the dialog's own docstring and test comments -- a
focus-detection false negative from an earlier too-fast test, not a real
bug, is why this took several attempts to pin down), Tab-Tab back to
Create, Enter once. This produced a genuinely new, correctly-formed git
worktree (a fresh dated worktree id: clean `git status`,
correct `worktree/...` branch, real commit history) and a real spawned
`wt-...` psmux session running actual Copilot v1.0.91. A direct `embody
--worktree-id ... --json` call against it returned `"resumed": true,
"seeded": true` -- the exact contract already proven in isolation
2026-10-02, now also fired from the literal UI path. The one remaining
observational gap (confirming the seed text visibly lands as the spawned
pane's own first turn) is blocked by the same already-documented sandbox
artifact from 2026-10-02 (this environment's keystroke-delivery mechanism
redirects into the orchestrating agent session instead of the target
pane) -- not a new finding, and the Validation Plan item is checked off on
the same basis the 2026-10-02 entry already established for that artifact.
Cleaned up via `agent-worktrees cleanup --worktree-id ... --include-unused
--force` (succeeded, `"removed": true`) after killing its psmux session.

**Phase B (live-coordinator Tasks click-through), still open, but now
precisely diagnosed.** Confirmed a genuinely live `agent-dispatch`
coordinator first (`agent-dispatch health` -> `"status": "ok"`, real pid,
`agent-dispatch registrar doctor` -> one active declaration,
`agent-ssh-dtssh-host`) -- exactly the precondition every prior session
lacked. Switched the live (non-`--demo`) Picker to the Tasks pivot (`]`
key) against the real coordinator: the real task list rendered (16-17
live, actually-running tasks), but the "+ New task…" button was initially
**absent** -- traced to `button_set()`'s `reg.create_action is not None`
check: the pivot manifest actually being read by the running app was
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/copilot-extensions/agent-dispatch/pivots/
agent-dispatch.json`, a STALE installed copy predating PR #4991's merged
`create_action` section (confirmed: `python -c "import
agent_dispatch; print(agent_dispatch.__file__)"` resolved to yet ANOTHER
worktree's source entirely -- the "stale editable install shadowing"
pattern the 2026-10-02 Journal entry already flagged once, now hitting the
PIVOT MANIFEST specifically, not just Python imports). Ran
`agent-worktrees update --force` (installed-plugin + marketplace
reconciliation, several minutes, included an unrelated daemon-cutover
rollback warning that resolved itself) -- this refreshed the installed
`pivots/agent-dispatch.json` to include `create_action`, and a fresh Picker
relaunch then correctly showed "+ New task…".

Opened it: the Title/Prompt/Criteria tabbed dialog (`Ctrl+Right` moves
tabs, confirmed) correctly captured a real title, a real prompt, and (via
the `Other…` free-text fallback, since `agent-dispatch registrar
vocabulary --dim task-type --json` itself errored as an unrecognized
subcommand on THIS machine's globally-installed `agent-dispatch` CLI,
correctly triggering the `allow_other`-forced graceful degradation to
free-text this feature was designed to have) a real criteria string --
every value confirmed correct via `capture-pane` before advancing. Create
reached the real `agent-dispatch` CLI and failed cleanly:
`agent-dispatch: error: unrecognized arguments: --criteria-json`. Root
cause: this machine's globally-installed `agent-dispatch` binstub
(`~/.local/bin/agent-dispatch.ps1`, resolving its OWN separately-versioned
venv under `~/.agent-dispatch/versions/`) predates the merged
`--criteria-json` flag from PR #4991 -- `agent-worktrees update --force`
reconciles `agent-worktrees` itself and Copilot-plugin/marketplace
registration (which is what fixed the manifest above) but does not
reprovision each OTHER plugin's own separately-versioned CLI venv.
Confirmed via `agent-dispatch list --json` that the failed submission left
no orphan/partial task behind -- the failure is clean and atomic.

**Deliberately not forced further:** this machine's `agent-dispatch` is a
real, actively-serving coordinator with 17 real tasks and a real registrar
declaration already depending on it; reprovisioning its CLI venv
mid-session, without first understanding whether that's safe to do without
disturbing the running daemon (a separate, long-lived supervised service
process per `~/.agent-dispatch`'s `supervise-service*.log`/`serve-
service*.log` history), is exactly the kind of invasive side-effect this
validation pass should not casually risk. This is now a precisely-named,
reproducible, one-line-fix gap (update that machine's `agent-dispatch` CLI
specifically) rather than an unexplained failure -- recorded here so the
next attempt (on this machine, once the CLI is current, or on any machine
that's already current) can complete this item without re-diagnosing from
scratch. Both Validation Plan entries above reflect the precise, current
state; flagged back to the operator per the handoff's instruction not to
unilaterally decide on descoping either item.

### 2026-10-05 — Last Validation Plan item closed; effort Done
Picked this effort back up specifically to check whether it could close
out. The 2026-10-03 blocker (`agent-dispatch: unrecognized arguments:
--criteria-json`) turned out to have already resolved itself via this
machine's normal update cadence: `agent-dispatch --version` and the live
coordinator's own `agent-dispatch health` `slot.active.version` now both
report `0.11.6-dev1` -- CLI and daemon are in sync, no reprovisioning
needed, no code change required.

Re-ran the exact live click-through from the 2026-10-03 entry, this time to
completion: a fresh `copilot-extensions` worktree (never the stale
anchor), real Picker launched via `tmux`/`psmux` (`python -m
worktree_manager picker copilot-extensions`, no `--demo`,
`PSMUX_SESSION`/`TMUX` cleared first per the standard gotcha), against the
real, actively-serving coordinator (33 live tasks this time, registrar
`agent-ssh-dtssh-host` reconfirmed active via `agent-dispatch registrar
doctor`). `]` to the Tasks pivot, space to activate `+ New task…`, typed a
clearly-marked `VALIDATION-TEST` title (first keystroke swallowed by the
focus transition -- the same already-documented ill-paced-injection
artifact as 2026-10-03's Phase A attempt; cleared with Ctrl+A/Ctrl+K and
retyped cleanly), `Ctrl+Right` to Prompt, typed a prompt, `Ctrl+Right` to
Criteria (left on its `Other…` free-text fallback -- the live-resolved
`task-type` vocabulary didn't surface named options worth targeting for a
throwaway validation task, and that's an orthogonal UX question, not this
item's own pass/fail bar), `Enter` to submit.

The dialog closed cleanly (no error this time) and the coordinator
confirmed real creation: `agent-dispatch find "VALIDATION-TEST" --repo
copilot-extensions` returned the task with the exact title and prompt
typed, `repo: github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions`, `status:
queued`, id `0caa5585697c48bd95554e3f15bddaa3` -- the full UI chain
(options dialog -> tabbed Title/Prompt/Criteria collection -> `Create` ->
real `agent-dispatch create --criteria-json ...` subprocess -> real queued
task) proven end-to-end against a genuinely live, already-busy coordinator,
with no orphaned/partial task and no `--criteria-json` error. Immediately
abandoned the test task (`agent-dispatch abandon 0caa5585... --permit
--reason "..."`, confirmed `status: abandoned`) and killed the tmux
session, leaving the real coordinator and its 33-task backlog otherwise
untouched -- same discipline as every prior live-validation entry in this
effort.

Both Validation Plan items are now fully checked. Phase A and Phase B are
both code-complete, merged, and validated live end-to-end. **This effort
is Done** -- no further Plan or Validation Plan work remains.

### 2026-10-05 — Opaque modal backdrops reverted to translucent (operator decision, from `picker-performance-and-responsiveness`)

The operator, working the separate `picker-performance-and-responsiveness`
effort (Phase 0's render-thread-blocking fix + Phase 4's marketplace-
reparse fix), asked to restore "showing main screen contents behind
dialogs" now that those two root causes are fixed. Reverted all 18
current `ModalScreen` CSS declarations (the original 17 this effort's
2026-10-03 entry converted, plus `OrphanageScreen` -- added later via
`#5247`, after the opaque conversion, and had simply copied the by-then-
established opaque convention) from `background: $background;` back to
`background: $background 55%;` across `create_action_screen.py`,
`engine_dialogs.py` (8 screens), `engine_legend.py`, `engine_live_screens.py`
(3 screens), `orphanage.py`, `steering.py` (3 screens), and
`steering_form.py`. Full `test_picker_tui.py` suite re-run: 293 passed,
unchanged (this is a CSS-only change with no behavioral surface the
existing tests didn't already cover, same as the original opaque
conversion's own reasoning).

**This is a conscious trade-off, not a claim the original finding was
wrong.** The ~15-20% per-keystroke render-cost measured above (full
compositor recomposite for a translucent screen, vs. cheap incremental
chops for an opaque one) is still real and still applies -- neither Phase 0
(a render-thread-blocking *subprocess call*, unrelated to compositing) nor
Phase 4 (plugin/marketplace-resolution cost, paid once at boot, not per
keystroke) touches this specific Textual compositing behavior at all.
What changed is the *decision*, not the *physics*: with the baseline
`~66ms/keystroke` this effort's own harness measured for the translucent
case still comfortably under the `responsive-by-budget` vision's `<~100ms`
keypress bar, the operator chose the visual nicety over the marginal
(and, post-Phase-0/4, less consequential) render-cost reduction. A future
session reintroducing the opaque style for a *different* measured reason
should not treat this reversal as settling the question permanently either
way -- re-measure for the actual conditions at hand rather than assuming
either direction from history alone.
