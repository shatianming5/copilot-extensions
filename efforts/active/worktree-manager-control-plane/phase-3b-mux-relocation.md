# Phase 3b, Slice 2 — Relocate Mux launch/reattach mechanics out of agent-worktrees

- **Parent effort:** [`README.md`](README.md) § Phase 3b
- **Tracks:** [#2062](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2062)
- **Governing vision:** [`visions/session-hosting`](../../../visions/session-hosting/README.md)
  Concepts/*Session-host provider*; the matching Non-Goal in
  [`visions/plugins/agent-worktrees`](../../../visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/README.md);
  the already-published [`visions/installer`](../../../visions/installer/README.md)
  §Features/`optional-worktree-agent-control-plane` ("muxing is a capability
  this app provides ... the plugins detect it and use it when present, and run
  **non-muxed** when it is absent").
- **Depends on:** [`phase-3b-ahp-relocation.md`](phase-3b-ahp-relocation.md)
  (Slice 1) proving the pattern of a relocated provider calling agent-worktrees
  only through its `--json` subprocess CLI. This slice does **not** wait for
  Slice 1's every step, but reuses its generic `execution-leg` verbs once they
  exist (see below).
- **Operator directive (2026-09-05):** the Mux relocation is a **clean,
  decisive cutover** — one canonical implementation, not an indefinitely
  maintained pair. The agent-worktrees implementation is proven and correct;
  it is migrated **verbatim**, not reconciled with, merged into, or replaced
  by Worktree Manager's own earlier, fledgling Picker-launch prototype (the
  Picker-slice-1/2/3 code predating the production-Picker transplant, PRs
  #494/#504/#505 — now retired scaffolding, not a competing implementation).
  Every step of this migration is validated against the existing Textual
  Picker golden/screenshot regression suite
  (`worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_picker_capture.py` and
  siblings) and clean-room scenarios, so "clean cutover" means *proven*, not
  merely *fast*.
- **Status:** In progress — Sub-slice 2a Step 1 landed (script files copied
  verbatim; deployment mechanism proven). Sub-slice 2a Step 2's
  `cmd_launch` repoint, direct non-mux fallback, and the deferred in-plugin
  script deletion are all now complete (the relocated Worktree Manager path
  had already been proven live across many self-updated versions). While
  the deletion was deferred, the two copies drifted (a post-exit stale-venv
  re-resolve fix landed only in agent-worktrees' now-deleted copy); that fix
  and a matching cross-plugin resolution consistency fix were ported into
  Worktree Manager's copy as part of completing this step, along with a
  latent PowerShell if-as-expression array-collapse bug in
  `pane-wrapper.ps1` found by the migrated test suite.
  Sub-slice 2b's design was revised twice (2026-09-12, see below): first
  after discovering the `sessions.py` coupling depth, then again (before any
  code was written) after discovering `_perform_remux` also backs the
  bundled Picker's standalone "Restore" action via `--restore` -- Sub-slice
  2b is now purely additive (a new query verb + WM's own executor), with no
  deletion in agent-worktrees. Implementation has not started.

## Why this is a different shape of problem than AHP

AHP is one ~350-line Python module plus a narrow persisted-record shape. Mux
is not:

| File | Size | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/launch-session.ps1` | 1,844 lines | Windows launcher: resolves a JSON launch plan from `agent-worktrees resolve`, executes it natively (spawns/attaches PSMux, profile selection, Windows Terminal fragment handling, seed injection, handoff-cutover argv, AHP token handoff), calls `agent-worktrees post-exit` for finalization on exit. |
| `plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/launch-session.sh` | 1,203 lines | POSIX equivalent (TMux). Same `resolve` → execute → `post-exit` shape. |
| `plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/launch-session.cmd` | 13 lines | Thin `cmd.exe` shim, used only for `--stdio`/`--acp` (stdin-forwarding requirement); interactive launches skip straight to the `.ps1`. |
| `plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/pane-wrapper.{sh,ps1}` | 175 / 311 lines | Wraps the actual tmux/psmux pane command: graceful exit-code handling, `--aw-ahp-token-file` handoff (confirms Mux already wraps AHP sessions today), initial-prompt injection receipt. |
| `__main__.py` `cmd_launch` | ~80 lines | Resolves the installed launcher script path and execs into it, forwarding `--no-update`/`--no-mux`/`--verbose` as env vars. **Already an external-process boundary**, not an in-process import. |
| `__main__.py` `cmd_remux` / `_perform_remux` | ~120 lines | The `remux` verb: POSIX adopts a bare live process into tmux via `reptyr`; Windows previews then (`--yes`) applies a reclaim-before-resume plan. Calls `reclaim_one`. |
| `__main__.py` `reclaim_one` | ~40 lines | Picker's "Reclaim" action and the Windows remux apply step share this: resolves bound Copilot process(es) via `reclaim.resolve_bound_copilots` and terminates them. |
| `agent_worktrees/reclaim.py` | whole module | Process-table introspection: builds a process table, classifies homing (`bare`/`mux`/`unknown`), resolves which processes are "bound" to a worktree. **Generic observation tooling**, reused by Reclaim, remux, and orphan-detection — not launch mechanics. |
| `agent_worktrees/sessions.py` | `has_mux_session`, `has_mux_session_named`, `LiveVerdict`, `verify_worktree_active` | **Live liveness observation**, queried fresh from the mux control socket each time — there is no persisted "mux binding" record analogous to `SessionBackendBinding`. This is the aggregate-status reducer's input and legitimately belongs to agent-worktrees per the vision's *provider-observation-ingestion* feature. |

Two things follow from this inventory:

1. **Mux liveness is observed, not persisted.** Unlike AHP, there is no
   `session_backend`-shaped binding to migrate to the generic `execution_leg`
   record for Mux itself — `has_mux_session` asks the live mux server every
   time. So Slice 2 does not need an `execution_leg` write path the way
   Slice 1 does; it only needs one if/when a relocated Mux provider wants to
   record *which* worktree a pane belongs to in a way agent-worktrees should
   observe generically (see Non-Goals — not attempted in this slice).
2. **The launcher scripts already call agent-worktrees only through its CLI**
   (`resolve`, `post-exit`) — an external-process boundary, not an in-process
   import. Relocating the *files* is therefore a "move + repoint installed-
   path resolution" problem for `cmd_launch`, not a deep Python untangling.
   The size risk is in the **scripts' own internal complexity** (profile
   selection, Windows Terminal fragments, handoff-cutover argv, AHP token
   handoff), not in their coupling to agent-worktrees.
3. **The deployment mechanism already exists, unmodified.** Worktree
   Manager's `self_install._copy_payload` copies the *whole* payload
   directory (`shutil.copytree`) into each versioned slot, and the bootstrap's
   `git clone` fetches the whole repo before `cd`-ing into `worktree-manager/`.
   A `worktree-manager/bin/` sibling directory therefore deploys automatically
   through both the self-update and the fresh-bootstrap path with **zero**
   packaging code changes — proven by
   `test_bin_directory_is_deployed_into_the_slot` (Sub-slice 2a Step 1).

## What "clean cutover" means here

Reconciling the operator's directive with the two already-published vision
invariants that constrain this migration:

- [`session-hosting`](../../../visions/session-hosting/README.md) requires
  agent-worktrees to remain fully functional with **zero** session-host
  providers present (§Non-Goals: "not a requirement for a terminal or
  multiplexer").
- [`installer`](../../../visions/installer/README.md) already states the
  resolution: *"a terminal multiplexer is a heavy, invasive dependency ...
  muxing is a capability this app provides (the plugins detect it and use it
  when present, and run **non-muxed** when it is absent) rather than
  something the lightweight plugins carry."*

So the clean cutover is: **exactly one implementation of muxed launch**
(migrated verbatim into Worktree Manager, canonical, no parallel
reimplementation preserved from Worktree Manager's own earlier prototype),
and a **much smaller, genuinely different** fallback in agent-worktrees for
when Worktree Manager is absent — a **direct, non-muxed Copilot invocation**,
not a second copy of the mux launcher scripts. This is decisively simpler
than the "keep a legacy fallback launcher until a deprecation window closes"
model this document originally proposed, and removes any period where two
mux implementations exist side by side:

| Worktree Manager present? | `cmd_launch` behavior |
|---|---|
| Yes (usable, version-probed) | Exec into `<worktree-manager slot>/bin/launch-session.*` — the one true mux implementation. |
| No | Exec Copilot **directly, non-muxed** — a small, new code path in agent-worktrees, not the retained giant script. Degraded (no mux, no reattach, no remux), but functional, matching the already-published graceful-degradation invariant. |

The old in-plugin `launch-session.{sh,ps1,cmd}`/`pane-wrapper.{sh,ps1}` are
**deleted from agent-worktrees in the same cutover PR** that adds the direct
non-mux fallback and repoints resolution — there is no dual-maintenance
window for the mux implementation itself.

## Recommendation: still two sub-slices, but a decisive cutover in each

Given the size (3,500+ lines across three platforms) and that `cmd_remux`
mixes generic liveness detection (which should stay) with a launch action
(which should move), this document proposes **two further sub-slices**. Each
sub-slice's *own* cutover is clean (no lingering duplicate implementation);
splitting into two sub-slices is about bounding review/test size per PR, not
about leaving Mux itself half-migrated.

### Sub-slice 2a — Move launcher scripts; repoint resolution; add the non-mux fallback

1. **Step 1 (done):** copy `launch-session.{sh,ps1,cmd}` and
   `pane-wrapper.{sh,ps1}` verbatim into `worktree-manager/bin/`. Zero logic
   changes. Proved deployable via the existing `_copy_payload` mechanism
   (no packaging code change needed) with a new self-install test.
2. **Step 2 (repoint + direct fallback portion done; deletion deferred by an
   explicit deviation):**
   - [x] Changed `agent-worktrees`'s `cmd_launch` to resolve
     `<worktree-manager install dir>/bin/launch-session.*` via
     `WORKTREE_MANAGER_ROOT` + `current-version`, reusing the same
     `--version` health-probe pattern as the bare-invocation Manager seam.
   - [x] Added the **direct, non-mux fallback**: when no usable Worktree
     Manager / relocated launcher is found, `cmd_launch` now resolves the
     normal launch plan and runs Copilot directly in the target worktree, then
     calls `agent-worktrees post-exit` after the child exits.
   - [x] **Delete** `plugins/agent-worktrees/bin/launch-session.{sh,ps1,cmd}`
     and `pane-wrapper.{sh,ps1}` from agent-worktrees, along with the
     mux-exclusive `terminal/session-options.{sh,ps1}`,
     `terminal/apply-mux-keybinds.{sh,ps1}`, and
     `terminal/psmux-passthrough.conf` (all four already had verbatim
     Worktree Manager copies; nothing else in agent-worktrees referenced
     them). The temporary deviation's own condition -- the relocated
     Worktree Manager launcher proven live on real hardware -- was met (the
     Manager's `bin/` scripts had already been the live path across many
     self-updated versions before this deletion landed); `cmd_launch` no
     longer tries an in-plugin fallback tier at all, only the relocated
     Worktree Manager launcher and the direct, non-mux fallback below.
     `install.{ps1,sh}` no longer deploy or health-check the deleted files
     (a lightweight Worktree Manager presence check replaced the old
     wrapper/terminal-script status lines); `scripts/psmux-path.ps1` stays,
     since it also serves agent-worktrees' own `Ensure-Psmux`/
     `Ensure-PsmuxSshSafe` install-time provisioning independent of the
     launch scripts. Regression coverage for the four deleted-and-relocated
     files (`test_pane_wrapper_argv.py`, `test_terminal_decoupling.py`,
     `test_launch_session_unwrap.py`) moved to `worktree-manager/tests/`
     rather than being dropped.
   - [x] The scripts' own calls into `agent-worktrees resolve` /
     `agent-worktrees post-exit` are unchanged in contract — still the same CLI
     subprocess boundary, now invoked from a different installed location.
   - [x] **Closed the actual live regression this slice exists to fix:**
     Worktree Manager's OWN transplanted production Picker (`_run_launch` in
     `worktree_manager/__main__.py`) previously routed every local, non-AHP
     launch through `launcher.compose_launch()`/`execute()` -- whose
     `MuxCapability` has **never** been wired to a real backend (`_capability`
     stays `_NO_MUX` unless something calls `set_mux_capability()`, which
     nothing does). Once the Manager's own `worktree-manager` binstub is on
     `PATH`, the bare-invocation seam hands the WHOLE interactive session to
     that Picker, bypassing `cmd_launch`/`launch-session.ps1` entirely --  so
     the `cmd_launch` repoint above, while correct and necessary for
     agent-worktrees' own standalone/fallback path, does **not** by itself
     restore muxed launches once Worktree Manager is installed. `_run_launch`
     now delegates the whole local, non-AHP launch to the SAME relocated
     `<own-install>/bin/launch-session.*` script (verbatim reuse, per the
     operator directive above) instead of `launcher.launch()`: it passes the
     **already-resolved** `plan.worktree_id` (never re-issuing `--new`/`--base`,
     which would create a second worktree), threads `--bare-resume` and
     `WORKTREE_NO_MUX` exactly as `cmd_launch` does, and lets the script's own
     resolve/launch/attach/post-exit take over. AHP-attached launches are
     deliberately excluded (unchanged, still `launcher.launch()`) -- AHP
     already rewrites `plan.cmd` to the attach client via `attach_plan()`,
     and routing that through the script would re-resolve a vanilla plan and
     clobber the rewrite; AHP mux-wrapping remains a known, separately-scoped
     follow-up.
3. **Validation gate for the cutover PR (required, not optional):**
   - Full `worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/` suite, especially
     `test_picker_capture.py`'s golden character-grid, ANSI, and SVG
     screenshot assertions — proves the Picker's rendered launch/resume
     affordances are pixel/text-identical before and after.
   - `worktree-manager` and `agent-worktrees` full plugin suites
     (`python tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees worktree-manager`).
   - Clean-room `agent-worktrees-solo` (proves agent-worktrees alone —
     i.e. exactly the non-mux fallback path — still round-trips
     register→create→finalize) and `worktree-manager-bootstrap` (proves the
     relocated scripts deploy on a pristine box). A **new combined**
     clean-room scenario exercising an actual interactive mux launch across
     both installed plugins is the strongest possible proof and should be
     authored before or immediately after this cutover lands, tracked as a
     follow-up if not ready in the same PR.

### Sub-slice 2b — Relocate the remux action; keep liveness detection

**Design revised 2026-09-12** after discovering the coupling runs deeper than
originally scoped below: `remux.py`'s POSIX reptyr-adoption action calls
`sessions.mux_session_name` / `build_mux_new_window_argv` /
`build_mux_new_session_argv` -- and those helpers are **not** remux-specific.
They are pervasive, load-bearing utilities used throughout `__main__.py` (list
rendering, session-catalog liveness, the bundled Picker's own native mux
launch when Worktree Manager is absent). Duplicating them into Worktree
Manager would be exactly the "parallel reimplementation" the operator's clean-
cutover directive forbids, and reads on `sessions.py` are exactly the vision's
*provider-observation-ingestion* feature this document already says stays put.
So the split is **not** "detection stays, both actions move as self-contained
logic" as originally written -- it mirrors the **resolve/execute pattern
Sub-slice 2a already established** for the main launch path: agent-worktrees
keeps sole ownership of *planning* (still owns every tmux-naming/argv-building
call), Worktree Manager owns only *executing* what agent-worktrees tells it to.

1. **New agent-worktrees query verb (planning only, no side effects, never
   terminates a process):**
   `agent-worktrees mux-remux-plan --worktree-id <id> [--session-id <id>]
   [--force-sudo | --no-force-sudo] --json`.
   - Refactors `_perform_remux`'s and `remux_bare_copilot`'s **guard/target-
     resolution** logic (already-has-live-mux refusal, ambiguous-owner
     rejection via `reclaim.py` unchanged, none-found) into this query,
     unchanged in substance -- reuses `reclaim.py` and `sessions.py` exactly
     as today.
   - **POSIX (Linux/WSL) result:** the *precise* reptyr pane-adoption `argv`
     the query would have run (built via the SAME
     `sessions.build_mux_new_window_argv`/`build_mux_new_session_argv`/
     `mux_session_name`, unchanged, still living here), the resolved
     `pid`/`session_id`/`session_name`, and whether `sudo` is required
     (`_needs_sudo()`, unchanged) -- but does **not** invoke it.
   - **Windows result:** the exact same preview shape `_perform_remux`
     already computes today (target `pid`/`session_id`, `reason`,
     `requires_resume`) -- but does **not** call `reclaim_one` itself; that
     becomes a separate, explicit step (below).
   - Every existing safety invariant (refuse live mux, refuse ambiguous
     owner, never resolve the calling process's own subtree) lives entirely
     in this query, verbatim.
2. **The action moves to Worktree Manager as a thin executor, not a
   reimplementation:**
   - **POSIX:** calls `mux-remux-plan --json`, runs the returned `argv`
     directly via `subprocess` (mechanical -- no tmux-naming knowledge of its
     own), then polls agent-worktrees' *existing, unchanged* liveness query
     (`has_mux_session` / the homing-observation path) to confirm the
     hand-over, mirroring `remux_bare_copilot`'s current verify-poll loop.
   - **Windows:** calls `mux-remux-plan --json` for the preview, then (on
     apply) calls the **already-existing, unchanged**
     `agent-worktrees reclaim --worktree-id <id> --bare-only --yes --json`
     verb (the same primitive Picker's plain "Reclaim" action already uses)
     to terminate the confirmed-unreachable owner, then relaunches through
     its **own relocated** `<bin>/launch-session.*` script from Sub-slice 2a
     in ordinary resume mode -- the identical path any normal Picker resume
     takes, not a new relaunch mechanic.
   - This means **no new Windows relaunch code** is needed in Worktree
     Manager at all: "reclaim-then-relaunch" is just "call the reclaim verb,
     then do a normal resume" -- both already-existing primitives.
3. **Correction (2026-09-12, before implementation started):** point 3 as
   originally written here ("delete `cmd_remux`/`_perform_remux`/
   `remux_bare_copilot`'s execution from agent-worktrees") is **unsafe as
   literally stated**. `_perform_remux` is not solely the standalone `remux`
   CLI verb's backend -- it is also called internally by
   `_restore_before_resume`, which backs `resolve --restore` and, through it,
   the bundled Picker's own **"Restore"** action (`picker_tui/engine.py`).
   That capability must keep working with **zero** session-host providers
   present (the vision's own invariant: the bundled Picker still ships and is
   still mux-capable until Phase 6c retires it, and `--restore`/"Restore" is
   exactly how it self-heals an unreachable bound session **without**
   Worktree Manager). Deleting the underlying action would regress that --
   exactly the class of live regression this whole effort exists to prevent.

   **Revised, purely additive plan:** agent-worktrees's existing
   `cmd_remux`/`_perform_remux`/`remux_bare_copilot` action machinery is
   **unchanged and stays** -- it is agent-worktrees' own zero-provider-mode
   remux capability (both the standalone `remux` verb and the internal
   `--restore` path keep using it exactly as today). The new
   `mux-remux-plan` query is an **additional** surface, refactoring the
   SAME guard/target-resolution logic into a shared, reusable pure function
   that both the existing action code and the new query call -- not a
   replacement for the existing action, and not something that removes any
   existing capability. Worktree Manager becomes a **second, independent**
   executor of that same plan (useful once WM wants its own "Restore"
   Picker-parity action without importing agent-worktrees' Python or
   duplicating tmux-naming logic) -- it does not replace or disable
   agent-worktrees' own standalone remux/`--restore` path, which remains the
   fallback when Worktree Manager is absent.
4. `reclaim_one` (used by both Picker "Reclaim" and the Windows remux action)
   **stays in agent-worktrees unchanged** -- already true today, reconfirmed:
   it is a generic process-termination operation over `reclaim.py`'s
   process-table observation, invoked identically by both callers.
5. Preserve every existing safety invariant from #1478/#1491 verbatim: refuse
   an existing live mux, refuse an ambiguous owner, never reap the calling
   process's own subtree. These live entirely inside the shared plan
   function now, called by both the existing action and the new query --
   "preserved" means the guard logic is shared, not duplicated or rewritten.
6. **No cutover/deletion in agent-worktrees for this sub-slice.** Unlike
   Sub-slice 2a (where exactly one launch implementation must exist), remux
   is not being relocated away from agent-worktrees -- agent-worktrees keeps
   its own standalone remux/`--restore` capability permanently (the
   zero-provider fallback), and Worktree Manager gains an *independent*
   second consumer of the same plan for its own eventual Picker-parity
   "Restore" action. "No parallel reimplementation" here means: don't
   duplicate the plan-computation logic (tmux-naming, guard checks) in both
   places -- it means share one plan function, not "only one place may
   execute a remux."

### Sub-slice 3 — Split the resident status-monitor's push/observe legs into Worktree Manager

Detailed ordered plan: [`phase-3b-substatus-monitor-relocation.md`](phase-3b-substatus-monitor-relocation.md).

This parent doc now keeps only the boundary statement:

- `agent-worktrees` retains the existing resident `status-monitor` daemon as
  the **sole accumulator/authority** for worktree status data.
- `worktree-manager` gains a new **companion mux daemon** that owns
  Worktree-Manager-managed worktree ⇄ mux-session/pane mapping and writes mux
  status-bar options.
- The two daemons communicate **bidirectionally**:
  1. Worktree Manager notifies `agent-worktrees` when a managed worktree gains,
     changes, or loses a live mux pane.
  2. `agent-worktrees` sends already-rendered status payloads back to Worktree
     Manager, which applies them to the mapped mux session(s).

The dedicated doc above defines the transport, message shapes, status-updater
retirement/reconciliation, implementation ordering, and validation contract.


## What stays in agent-worktrees (not relocated, ever)

- `sessions.py`'s `has_mux_session`, `has_mux_session_named`, `LiveVerdict`,
  `verify_worktree_active` — live liveness **observation**, feeding the
  aggregate-status reducer. This is the vision's *provider-observation-
  ingestion* feature, not launch mechanics.
- `sessions.py`'s `mux_session_name`, `build_mux_new_window_argv`,
  `build_mux_new_session_argv` — **discovered during Sub-slice 2b design
  (2026-09-12)** to be pervasive planning/naming utilities used throughout
  `__main__.py` well beyond remux (list rendering, session-catalog liveness,
  the bundled Picker's own native mux launch). These stay so agent-worktrees
  remains the single owner of "how to name/build a mux session for worktree
  X"; Worktree Manager only ever *executes* an argv agent-worktrees already
  computed (`mux-remux-plan`), never rebuilds one itself.
- `reclaim.py` in full — process-table introspection and bound-process
  resolution, reused by Reclaim (a non-relaunching action) independent of
  which launcher a worktree uses.
- `reclaim_one` — generic termination, not Mux-specific.
- The `resolve`/`post-exit` CLI verbs — these are the generic "give me a
  launch plan" / "run finalization after the child exits" contract every
  launcher (Mux today, potentially others later) calls into. They are
  already provider-neutral in shape and do not move.

## Ordered implementation steps

1. **(Done)** Copy launcher/wrapper scripts into `worktree-manager/bin/`,
   unchanged; prove the deployment mechanism with a self-install test.
2. **(Done)** Add the health-probed new-location resolution **and** the
   direct non-mux fallback to `cmd_launch`; **defer deleting** the old
   in-plugin scripts until a follow-up live-proof cleanup PR removes the
   temporary rollback. Also closed the concurrent live regression where
   Worktree Manager's own `_run_launch` bypassed the relocated launcher
   entirely (see `README.md` journal, 2026-09-10).
3. Author (or extend) a combined clean-room scenario proving an actual
   interactive mux launch end-to-end across both installed plugins.
4. Implement Sub-slice 2b per the revised (2026-09-12, twice-corrected)
   design above:
   a. Extract `_perform_remux`'s/`remux_bare_copilot`'s guard and
      target-resolution logic into a shared, reusable plan function
      (unchanged in substance) called by BOTH the existing action code
      (`cmd_remux`, `_restore_before_resume` -- unaffected, still fully
      functional standalone) and a new
      `agent-worktrees mux-remux-plan --json` query verb.
   b. Add Worktree Manager's OWN, independent executor consuming that
      query: POSIX runs the returned `argv` + polls existing liveness;
      Windows calls the existing `agent-worktrees reclaim --bare-only --yes
      --json` then relaunches via its own relocated launcher in ordinary
      resume mode.
   c. **No deletion in agent-worktrees.** `cmd_remux`, `_perform_remux`, and
      `remux_bare_copilot`'s execution stay exactly as they are today --
      this sub-slice is purely additive (see the correction above).
5. Update/add tests for the new shared plan function and query verb; add
   Worktree Manager tests for its new executor. No existing test should need
   to change in spirit (the existing action's behavior is unchanged).

## Validation

- Existing launcher contract tests continue to pass unmodified in spirit
  (only the resolved script path changes).
- The **full** `test_picker_capture.py` golden/ANSI/SVG suite passes
  unmodified — the Picker's rendered launch/resume/create affordances are
  provably unaffected by where the launcher scripts live.
- A worktree with no Worktree Manager installed still functions via the new
  direct non-mux fallback (no mux, no reattach, no remux — degraded but
  working), proven by the `agent-worktrees-solo` clean-room scenario.
- `remux` detection-only query returns the same verdict before and after the
  split, for the same fixture process states (existing live mux, ambiguous
  owner, unreachable bare process).
- `reclaim_one`/Picker "Reclaim" behavior is provably unaffected by this
  slice (it does not touch the launcher at all).

## Non-Goals of this slice

- **Not an internal decomposition of the 1,844/1,203-line scripts.** They
  move as-is; simplifying their internals is separate, future work.
- **Not a persisted Mux execution-leg record.** Mux liveness stays
  live-observed; this slice does not introduce a `provider: "mux"`
  `execution_leg:` writer. If a future need arises (e.g. cross-machine mux
  observation) it is a separate, explicitly scoped addition.
- **Not a change to `resolve`/`post-exit`'s contract.** The scripts keep
  calling the same generic CLI verbs; only where the scripts themselves live
  changes.
- **Not a reconciliation with Worktree Manager's earlier, fledgling
  Picker-launch prototype.** That code is retired scaffolding; the migrated
  agent-worktrees implementation is authoritative and unmodified in substance.
