## Guiding Intent

Resuming a worktree after a handoff should always land the rightful, current
head session -- never a stale continuation of a predecessor's already-concluded
context, and never a second session racing an existing live one. Separately,
starting new work should be cheap to check against a duplicate claimant already
driving the same objective elsewhere in the fleet.

## Participants

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase PRs.
- **Host (owns PRs):** Driving agent.
- **Delegates:** none currently.
- **Handoff:** n/a (single participant today).

## Context

Operator-observed symptom: resuming a worktree that previously handed off
sometimes lands a session into the tail end of the *predecessor's own*
context-loaded session (the handoff prompt) rather than a genuinely fresh
head -- and `/clear`ing that session then reports the handoff as already
consumed. This makes operators reluctant to resume worktrees that ever handed
off, precisely the case recovery depends on most.

This is not a net-new problem: **issue #84** ("Session lifecycle: single
current session per worktree -- head pointer + asserted conclusion + two-way
handoff chain") already names the model and has sat open, unclaimed, 0
comments. This effort supplies the concrete mechanism and drives it to
landing. Related, narrower issues: #912 (sessionStart succession awareness),
#3000 (context-handoff: reconcile authoritative handoff target across
mux/agent-worktrees/agent-dispatch), #910 (mirror handoff reference into the
worktree record).

A second, smaller and independent symptom folded in here because both concern
"which agent is authoritative right now": agents rarely check whether another
worktree is already driving the same objective before starting new work, even
though `agent-worktrees list --json` makes that cheap -- and when a related
chain of repos/worktrees is involved, the *root claimant* actually driving the
objective can be a worktree other than the one nearest at hand.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Acknowledgement-gated head succession (#3584, closes groundwork for #84)
- [ ] Restrict head-claiming-from-**vacant** to the `sessionStart` hook alone
      (the operator's own "session-start hook must always claim head unless
      empty" request). _(agent-recommended precision, from PR review
      analysis)_ Define "vacant" precisely as two distinct,
      separately-enumerated cases —
      never conflated into one "never set" test: **(a) fresh** — the worktree
      has genuinely never had a head; **(b) confirmed-recovered** — a prior
      head existed but its predecessor is proven fully abandoned through the
      existing recovery procedure, and that procedure is what marks the slot
      vacant again, not an implicit inference. No other hook/extension point
      may write the slot in either case.
- [ ] _(agent-recommended, corrected via PR review analysis after an
      initial design flaw)_ Model displacing an *existing* head as a single
      atomic, acknowledgement-gated transfer — reconciled with
      `docs/patterns/context-handoff-lifecycle.md`'s existing invariant that
      **the predecessor remains head until the successor proves it can
      recover the baton**. Explicitly reject the earlier
      "predecessor-clears-then-successor-claims" two-phase design considered
      during planning: a Copilot code review correctly flagged that an
      unconditional clear-before-claim opens a race where a delayed or failed
      launch strands the worktree with no authoritative head. The corrected
      model never separates "vacate" from "claim" into two steps.
- [ ] Confirm this composes with, not replaces, full session lineage
      journaling (every session ever associated with the worktree stays
      recorded independently of the current head).
- [ ] _(agent-recommended, added from PR review analysis, not the original
      operator request)_ Add the **creation-side guard** #84 already
      specifies: creating a new session in a worktree whose head is still
      active is *refused* by default, not silently permitted, with a
      structured reason enumerating the three resolutions (reuse, hand off,
      sunset) plus an explicit, attributable break-glass override —
      matching agent-bridge's existing `409 live_cli_holds_worktree` shape.
      Without this, restricting who can *write* the head slot does not by
      itself stop a second session from being *created* while an existing
      head is still live, so the effort's "never a second session racing an
      existing live one" guarantee would be unmet. This item is load-bearing
      for that guarantee, not optional polish.
- [ ] _(agent-recommended, added from PR review analysis)_ **Carve out the
      legitimate handoff launch — as an explicit cross-plugin dependency,
      not a self-contained Phase 1 mechanism.** The default-refuse rule
      above must not also block `context-handoff-lifecycle`'s own normal
      step 4 ("launch the successor without changing the worktree head" —
      i.e. the successor session is deliberately created *while the
      predecessor is still head*, by design). A review round correctly
      caught that an undifferentiated guard would make ordinary handoff
      indistinguishable from break-glass — and a further review round
      correctly caught that the carve-out as first written assumed an
      "authenticated, persisted handoff token carrying successor identity"
      that doesn't actually exist yet in this shape:
      `context-handoff-lifecycle` persists a task/file **continuation**
      before launch, but the real session identity is only created after
      prompt submission and acknowledged later — nothing today assigns
      which plugin (context-handoff, agent-bridge, or agent-worktrees
      itself) owns minting and verifying the identity the creation-guard
      would need to distinguish a legitimate handoff from an ad-hoc launch.
      This item is therefore **an open cross-plugin design question to
      resolve during Phase 1's own implementation-time design**, not a
      pre-solved mechanism: name the owning plugin and the contract before
      the creation-guard can rely on it.
- [ ] _(agent-recommended, added from PR review analysis)_ **Reserve the
      successor idempotently across retries — never a one-shot admission.**
      A further review round correctly caught that "admitting exactly one
      launch attempt per token" contradicts the cited lifecycle's own retry
      contract: a failed or uncertain *first* launch must be able to resume
      from its checkpoint for the *same* successor (the "same-successor
      retry resumes from checkpoint instead of replaying a consumed task"
      invariant already recorded in `context-handoff-lifecycle`), while only
      the final **takeover/acknowledgement** step is truly one-time. The
      creation-guard's token check must therefore *idempotently reserve or
      identify the same successor* across repeated presentations of the
      same token — not treat the first admission as the only permissible
      launch attempt, which would incorrectly block the pattern's own
      legitimate retry path. Break-glass remains for the case with no such
      token at all.
- [ ] Reconcile with #912 and #3000's overlapping scope so the three don't
      land contradictory mechanisms.

### Phase 2 — Duplicate-claimant discovery + root-claimant surfacing (#3585)
- [ ] Strengthen the `worktree` skill's instructions to make an early
      `list --json` check (filtered on bound effort/objective) a routine step
      before starting substantial new work.
- [ ] When a chain of related worktrees/repos is involved, resolve discovery
      to the root claimant actually driving the objective, not the nearest or
      most-recently-touched member of the chain.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Simulate a handoff: successor proves it can recover the baton and the
      single atomic acknowledgement both displaces the predecessor and seats
      the successor; resuming does not land inside the predecessor's
      concluded context.
- [ ] Simulate a delayed/failed launch (successor never acknowledges): head
      remains with the predecessor, non-vacant and recoverable, never
      falsely displaced by a launch that didn't complete.
- [ ] Confirm no hook other than `sessionStart` can seat a head from vacant,
      and no path can displace an existing head without a verified successor
      acknowledgement (two targeted negative tests).
- [ ] Attempt to create a second session in a worktree whose head is still
      active: the attempt is refused with the structured reuse/hand-off/
      sunset reason, never silently allowed to proceed; a break-glass
      override is available, explicit, and attributable.
- [ ] A legitimate `context-handoff-lifecycle` handoff launch (carrying its
      authenticated persisted token, once the owning plugin and contract are
      named per the open cross-plugin question above) is let through the
      same guard without needing break-glass, while an unrelated ad-hoc
      new-session attempt against the same live head is still refused.
- [ ] Simulate a failed/uncertain first launch retrying with the *same*
      handoff token: the retry resumes toward the *same* successor from its
      checkpoint (never refused as a "second" launch, and never spawning a
      competing successor); only the final takeover/acknowledgement step is
      one-time, and only a genuinely *different* token can seat a different
      successor.
- [ ] A fleet with an existing worktree bound to effort X surfaces that
      worktree (and, where a chain is involved, the root claimant) when a
      second agent checks before starting work on X.

## Proposal

_Pending — this effort's plan itself will be submitted for review per the
repo's `pr-self-merge` profile before Phase 1 implementation begins._

## Journal

### 2026-09-24 — Kickoff
- Effort created from a facility planning session. Deliberately did not open
  a new issue duplicating #84 -- it already names the model precisely; this
  effort supplies the mechanism and cites it plus #912/#3000/#910 as related.
  Filed #3584 (mechanism) and #3585 (discovery/root-claimant), folding the
  smaller discovery item in here rather than a fourth effort, since both are
  about "which agent has authority right now."

### 2026-09-25 — Corrected the head-transfer mechanism against an existing invariant
- The PR's automated review correctly flagged the original two-phase
  "predecessor clears `head`, then a later `sessionStart` claims the vacant
  slot" design: an unconditional clear-before-claim opens a race window where
  a delayed or failed successor launch strands the worktree with no
  authoritative head. It also flagged that this contradicted the already-shipped
  `docs/patterns/context-handoff-lifecycle.md` invariant that **the
  predecessor remains head until the successor proves it can recover the
  baton**, with head movement and successor acknowledgement happening as one
  atomic step. Revised the vision (`plugins/agent-worktrees` §Concepts/Current
  head and succession, renamed Feature `atomic-acknowledgement-transfer`) and
  this effort's Phase 1/Validation Plan to match the existing pattern instead
  of introducing a second, weaker one. The two-slot vocabulary (`head`/`backup`)
  from the original operator request is preserved as historical record in the
  Request quote above, but the design itself now models succession as one
  acknowledgement-gated transfer, not two independent slot writes.

### 2026-09-25 — Closed the creation-side race, precised "vacant"
- A further review round caught two more real gaps: (1) restricting who can
  *write* the head slot said nothing about who can *create a new session* in
  a worktree whose head is still live -- #84 already specifies a
  creation-side refusal guard for exactly this, and the effort's own stated
  guarantee ("never a second session racing an existing live one") was
  unmet without it. Added it as an explicit, load-bearing Phase 1 item plus
  a matching Validation Plan bullet. (2) "Genuinely never having been set"
  conflated two distinct vacancy cases (fresh vs. confirmed-recovered);
  re-worded to enumerate them separately so an implementation can't
  accidentally reject the recovery case or permit an unverified reclaim.

### 2026-09-25 — Carved out the legitimate handoff launch; pulled vision back to intent-level
- Review caught that the round-3 creation-guard, as written, would also
  refuse `context-handoff-lifecycle`'s own normal handoff launch (which
  deliberately creates the successor while the predecessor is still head)
  -- leaving break-glass as the only apparent way through, making ordinary
  handoff indistinguishable from an unsafe override. Added an explicit
  carve-out: the guard recognizes the authenticated persisted handoff
  token/successor identity that pattern already produces, and permits
  exactly that launch while still refusing unrelated ad-hoc attempts.
  Added a matching Validation Plan bullet.
- Separately, the vision's head-succession paragraph had drifted into
  implementation protocol (naming the session-start hook specifically,
  describing write ordering) rather than stating only the should-be
  outcome -- against the vision template's own pure-intent rule. Rewrote it
  to state the guarantee (successor proof moves authority; nothing is
  surrendered without it) and pointed to `context-handoff-lifecycle.md` for
  the actual mechanics rather than duplicating them in the vision.

### 2026-09-25 — Second intent-level scrub
- The Concept paragraph's fix wasn't enough: the paired Feature
  (`single-authorized-head-claimant`) still prescribed the realization
  ("exactly one code path", "a session-start integration", hook/extension
  write restrictions). Reworded to state only the outcome -- one
  authoritative claim, no competing overwrite path -- leaving which
  mechanism enforces it (session-start hook or otherwise) to this effort's
  own Plan rather than the vision.

### 2026-09-25 — Fenced the handoff token to single consumption
- Review caught that recognizing a valid handoff token isn't by itself
  enough: `context-handoff-lifecycle` already anticipates two independent
  launch attempts observing the same persisted baton (a genuine retry
  racing a still-in-flight original) and relies on task-backed consumption
  writing a durable checkpoint before a one-time consume to stay safe.
  Added an explicit Plan item requiring the creation-guard's token check to
  compose with that same atomic single-consumption fence -- admitting
  exactly one launch per token and resolving a genuine retry to the same
  successor, not a competing second one -- plus a matching Validation Plan
  bullet simulating two near-simultaneous legitimate launch attempts.

### 2026-09-25 — Demarcated review-derived Plan items as agent-recommended
- Review caught that several Plan items added across prior rounds
  (atomic-acknowledgement redesign, creation-side guard, handoff carve-out,
  token single-consumption fence, and the precise vacant-case enumeration)
  originated from PR review analysis, not the operator's quoted request,
  but weren't visibly marked as such per the `planning-efforts` skill's
  demarcation rule. Added explicit `(agent-recommended)` tags to those
  bullets so a later reader can distinguish the operator's own
  head/backup-slot request from the agent's corrected realization of it.

### 2026-09-25 — Corrected the token model: idempotent reservation, and named as an open cross-plugin question
- Two further review catches on the round-8 token-fencing item: (1) "admit
  exactly one launch attempt per token" actually contradicted the cited
  lifecycle's own retry contract (a failed/uncertain first launch must
  resume toward the *same* successor from checkpoint; only the final
  takeover/acknowledgement is one-time) -- reworded to require idempotent
  reservation/identification of the same successor across retries, not
  one-shot admission. (2) The whole carve-out assumed an "authenticated
  persisted handoff token carrying successor identity" that doesn't
  actually exist in that shape yet -- `context-handoff-lifecycle` persists
  a task/file *continuation* pre-launch, but real session identity forms
  only after prompt submission and is acknowledged later, and nothing
  today assigns which plugin owns minting/verifying it. Reframed this item
  as an explicit open cross-plugin design question for Phase 1's own
  implementation-time design, rather than a pre-solved mechanism this
  effort's planning could take for granted.
