## Guiding Intent

Every `agent-*` runtime plugin hand-maintains its own canonical installer
entrypoint — `scripts/install.ps1`/`scripts/install.sh` where present, else
`scripts/init.ps1`/`scripts/init.sh` (the repo's fallback canonical entrypoint
when `install.*` is absent, e.g. `agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`,
`agent-machines`) — full lifecycle managers (venv build, package install,
binstub generation, versioned-slot management, scheduled-task/service wiring,
deploy manifests, ZDD cutover, draining) that are supposed to all follow the
same install contract (`docs/install-contract.md`) but are, in practice, ~12
independently-authored copies. When a bug is found in the shared *mechanics*
(not the per-service specifics), it must be manually ported to every plugin by
hand — exactly the failure mode that just recurred with a venv-corruption fix
(a shared uv-managed-interpreter race producing a stale/broken venv slot,
tracked in a downstream consumer repo and fixed here via
copilot-extensions#2482): the same `New-SignedVenv`/`uv venv` defect existed
in agent-bridge, agent-logger, agent-vault, agent-index, agent-codespaces,
agent-dispatch, agent-ssh, agent-containers, agent-mcp, and agent-machines,
and only the first two got fixed before the human operator had to say "we
shouldn't have to keep fixing per-app installers."

This effort's goal: collapse the **shared engine** (the parts of the installer
that don't vary by service — uv acquisition, venv build + health/retry,
package install, binstub generation, versioned-slot lifecycle, deploy
manifest, scheduled-task management, ZDD cutover, draining) into ONE canonical
vendored source, fanned out byte-identically to every plugin (the same pattern
already proven for `versioned_runtime.py`), with each plugin's own installer
entrypoint shrinking to a thin per-service **config** (package dir(s), launch
command, sibling installs, and a small capability flag set: supports
scheduled tasks, supports ZDD cutover, supports draining, etc.) plus a single
call into the shared engine's entry point. A bug fixed once in the canonical
engine is fixed everywhere on the next sync + version bump — no more
hand-porting. This does not change what `self-contained-runtime` and
`immutable-versioned-runtime` promise (every plugin still owns a complete,
standalone runtime that its own installer deploys, with nothing borrowed at
*runtime* from a sibling or a git checkout); it changes how the installer's
own *authoring-time* mechanics stay in sync without N independently-drifting
copies.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Effort owner (rotates per phase) | Drives the active phase; see the effort's Journal for current owner and phase | This repo's normal worktree/PR flow — no fixed venue |

_Later phases (per-plugin rollout) may be split across further worktrees/sessions
as independent per-plugin PRs; see Coordination._

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase/per-plugin PRs. Each phase below is a
  self-contained, mergeable PR — mirroring how `uniform-runtime-resolution`
  (the `versioned_runtime.py` collapse, effort #581/#765) was landed as a
  sequence of phased PRs rather than one giant change.
- **Host (owns PRs):** whichever session/worktree is actively executing the
  current phase; only one phase should be in flight at a time to avoid
  cross-phase merge conflicts in the same installer files.
- **Delegates:** none yet — this is currently solo work. If parallelized,
  each delegate should own one *plugin's* rollout PR (Phase 2+), never a
  cross-cutting slice of the canonical engine itself.
- **Handoff:** completion criteria differ by phase type. **Phase 0** (audit,
  no code) is "done" once its PR merges with reviewed audit findings recorded
  in `## Proposal` — no deploy or sync-tool check applies, since neither a
  plugin change nor the sync tool exists yet at that point. **Phase 1+**
  (any phase that changes a plugin's installer) is "done" only when its PR is
  merged, its plugin(s) redeployed and verified healthy, and
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` (built in Phase 1) is green in CI.
  Use the standard context-handoff flow to hand off between phases; the
  Journal below is the resumption point.

## Context

- **`visions/plugin-services` §Features/`self-contained-runtime`**: *"Every
  runtime plugin owns a complete, standalone runtime (venv + binstub +
  service) that its own installer deploys and updates. Nothing a service
  needs to run is borrowed from a sibling plugin or from a git checkout of
  this repo."* This is the governing behavior this effort extends (not
  changes): it directly rules out fetching the shared engine from a git
  checkout at install/runtime, which is why byte-vendoring (not a git-fetch
  bootstrap) is this effort's chosen mechanism (see the design-decision note
  before Phase 1).
- **`visions/plugin-services` §Features/`immutable-versioned-runtime`**: the
  vendored engine lives *inside* each plugin's existing immutable versioned
  install; this effort does not change that model, only what authoring-time
  duplication looks like beneath it.
- **`docs/patterns/runtime-agent-plugin.md`** — the governing pattern for "add
  an `agent-*` plugin," including the cross-platform install contract shape
  this effort's canonical engine must keep satisfying.
- **`docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-cutover.md`** and
  **`docs/patterns/durable-vs-versioned-runtime.md`** — the existing patterns
  for ZDD cutover and durable-vs-versioned-runtime split; the engine's
  `SupportsZddCutover`/draining config flags must compose with these, not
  reimplement them.
- **`docs/install-contract.md`** is the existing, extensively-detailed
  contract every plugin's installer must already follow. It explicitly states
  the architectural constraint this effort must respect: *"Because the
  Copilot CLI marketplace pulls each plugin's payload independently, each
  plugin's install flow must be completely self-contained — there is no
  shared install module resolved at install or runtime."* Shared primitives
  are **vendored in byte-identically at authoring time... kept in sync by a
  repo tool** rather than resolved from a common location at runtime. This
  effort does not challenge that constraint — it *extends* the same vendoring
  pattern to a much larger shared surface than today's single-file
  `versioned_runtime.py`.
- **Existing precedent to mirror exactly:**
  - `libs/versioned-runtime/versioned_runtime.py` — the canonical single
    source for the immutable-versioned-slot primitive.
  - `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py` — fans the canonical file out
    byte-identically to every Python runtime plugin's `scripts/`, `--check`
    mode for CI/pre-push. Notably already supports **opt-in adoption**
    (a plugin adopts `resolve-runtime.*` by dropping a copy in; the sync then
    keeps it byte-identical) — the same opt-in model this effort should use
    for a phased plugin-by-plugin rollout.
  - `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` — a *different*, more generic
    existing guard for vendored **Python packages** under
    `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>` (byte-identical `src/` trees + matching
    versions). It does not apply directly here because `install.ps1`/`.sh` are
    not `pip`-installed packages — they're the scripts that *build* the venv
    in the first place — but its "byte-identical + version-locked" invariant
    is the same one this effort needs for the new engine files.
  - `efforts/active/uniform-runtime-resolution/` (Status: Done) — the closed
    effort that did this exact collapse for `versioned_runtime.py` in phased
    PRs. Read its Journal for the phasing discipline and pitfalls before
    planning Phase 1+ here.
- **Immediate trigger:** a venv-corruption defect (a shared uv-managed
  interpreter cache leaving a slot with the python binary present but
  `pyvenv.cfg` missing/incomplete after a concurrent `uv venv` race) was fixed
  in `agent-bridge` and mirrored by hand into `agent-logger`
  (copilot-extensions#2482). The same `New-SignedVenv`/`uv venv` pattern (and
  an earlier, related shared-interpreter-race retry fix it built on) is
  duplicated, unfixed, in at least: `agent-vault`, `agent-index`,
  `agent-codespaces`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-containers`,
  `agent-mcp`, `agent-machines`. This effort exists so that class of bug gets
  fixed once, not N times.
- **Scale (per-plugin canonical installer entrypoint line counts as of
  2026-09-12, PowerShell side only — `install.ps1` where it exists, else
  `init.ps1`; re-check before relying on these for the Validation Plan's
  shrinkage measurement, as they drift with routine bugfixes):**
  agent-worktrees 3638, agent-dispatch 2940, agent-bridge 2855, agent-machines
  2141 (`init.ps1`), agent-index 2228, agent-codespaces 1360, agent-logger
  1392, agent-vault 1178, agent-containers 897 (`init.ps1`), budget-guidance
  886, agent-mcp 826 (`init.ps1`), agent-ssh 789. The `.sh` counterparts are
  similar in size. This is ~20,000+ lines of independently-authored installer
  logic across the fleet, most of it mechanically identical.
  - **`budget-guidance` is in scope for the audit** (it is a `pyproject.toml`
    runtime plugin per `tools/check-docs-consistency.py`'s definition, with an
    `install.ps1` that builds a venv via `uv venv` like the others) but is
    **excluded from this effort's rollout scope** because it is not an
    `agent-*` persistent-service plugin — it's a skill-delivery plugin with an
    incidental Python component, not a long-running daemon needing scheduled
    tasks/ZDD cutover/draining. Re-evaluate only if its installer independently
    picks up the same shared-engine bugs this effort is fixing.
- **`agent-bridge`'s installer is repeatedly cited elsewhere in this repo as
  "the reference implementation"** (e.g. a downstream consumer's tracked issue
  requiring `agent-logger` to mirror it) — it should likely be the source the
  canonical engine is extracted *from*, and the first plugin re-pointed *at*
  the canonical engine (dogfooding before asking any other plugin to adopt
  it).

## Plan

### Phase 0 — Audit the real shared surface (no code changes)
- [x] Diff `New-SignedVenv` / `Ensure-Uv` / `Invoke-UvVenvResilient` /
      `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` / `Invoke-NativeCapture` /
      `Test-IsSreModuleMismatch` / `Test-IsVenvCorruption` / binstub-writing /
      deploy-manifest-writing / scheduled-task functions across all ~13
      runtime plugins' canonical installer entrypoint — `install.ps1` where it
      exists, else `init.ps1` (`agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`,
      `agent-machines`) — PowerShell first; `.sh` mirrors (`install.sh`/
      `init.sh`) after the shape is settled.
- [x] Classify every duplicated function as: **(a) byte-identical or
      near-identical already** (pure engine — safe to collapse verbatim),
      **(b) same shape, different constants** (needs a config parameter, e.g.
      package name, Python version pin), or **(c) genuinely per-service**
      (agent-bridge's sibling-plugin install, agent-dispatch's supervisor
      service, agent-index's separate torch-stack engine venv, agent-codespaces'
      ssh-manager+cred-relay+config-migrate installs — these stay in the
      per-plugin config/wrapper, not the engine).
- [x] Write the findings into `## Proposal` below before starting Phase 1 —
      this determines the engine's real function surface and config schema.

### Design decision — vendoring over git-fetch (resolved 2026-09-12)

Before Phase 1 started, the operator raised a real alternative: instead of
vendoring (byte-copying) the engine into every plugin, ship each plugin with a
tiny bootstrap stub that fetches the canonical engine directly via
`uv`'s git-VCS support (`uv pip install`/`uvx --from
"git+https://github.com/<org>/<this-repo>@<pinned-sha>#subdirectory=libs/installer-engine"
...`), pinned to an exact commit. This is technically feasible — `uv` is
pip-compatible for `git+URL@rev#subdirectory=path` sources and has its own git
support — and, if the engine were also rewritten as a single cross-platform
Python package, it would eliminate the PowerShell/bash **fork** duplication
too (not just the per-plugin duplication byte-vendoring solves).

**Decided: byte-vendoring, not git-fetch**, because git-fetch trades the
current problem for a worse instance of the *same* problem this effort exists
to prevent:

- **New mandatory network dependency at install/update time.** Today, once
  the marketplace payload is copied, install runs offline except for
  precedented, narrow network touches (uv self-acquire, PyPI/governed-feed
  installs). Git-fetch makes every install/update depend on GitHub
  reachability — including the exact moment someone needs to repair a broken
  install during an incident.
- **A new shared cache reintroduces the same hazard class already fixed
  once.** The fetched engine has to land in a local cache that concurrent
  installs share — structurally the same "shared cache, concurrent writers,
  partial-write corruption" shape as uv's managed-interpreter cache that
  caused the shared-interpreter-race bugs fixed via copilot-extensions#2482
  (and its earlier SRE-mismatch precursor). Vendoring keeps each plugin's
  copy inside its own already-isolated payload — no new shared-cache surface
  at all.
- **It would reverse a deliberate, documented constraint**
  (`docs/install-contract.md`: *"there is no shared install module resolved
  at install or runtime... each plugin's install flow must be completely
  self-contained"*) rather than extend it. Reversing that is a bigger,
  separate decision than this effort's actual trigger (stop hand-porting
  installer bugs) requires.
- **The real duplication-elimination win (ps1/sh fork) needs a full rewrite
  either way** — byte-vendoring doesn't get it, but neither does git-fetch
  unless the engine becomes pure Python, which is a much larger, separable
  rewrite (SAC-safe launchers, Task Scheduler vs. systemd wiring, etc., all
  currently native shell) that can be evaluated on its own merits later,
  independent of *how* the engine reaches each plugin.

**Kept as a clean off-ramp, not closed off:** `libs/installer-engine/` gets a
real `pyproject.toml` from Phase 1 on, so it is *also* a valid
pip/uv git-fetch target later, if the cache-concurrency and
offline-failure questions get real answers in a future effort. This phase
does not have to bet on both problems (duplication *and* how it's delivered)
at once.

### Design decision — `agent-pull-requests` as the Phase 1 pilot instead of `agent-bridge` (resolved 2026-09-22)

The Plan below originally named `agent-bridge` (a live production daemon,
deployed on real operator machines) as the Phase 1 reference conversion. A
new, unrelated effort (`agent-pull-requests`, a brand-new small on-demand CLI
plugin with no daemon, no scheduled task, and no live production traffic)
needed a real installer at the same time this effort was still Draft with
zero engine code written. The operator explicitly approved reordering: build
the real engine now and make `agent-pull-requests` the first pilot
conversion, ahead of `agent-bridge`.

Rationale: proving the engine's shape against a brand-new, low-risk,
zero-existing-users plugin is strictly safer than a first cut against a live
daemon other sessions/machines already depend on. `agent-bridge`'s own
conversion (Phase 1's originally-planned reference) remains open follow-through
and should still happen — its test-suite migration
(`test_install_sre_retry.py`, `test_install_venv_corruption_retry.py`,
`test_installer_powershell51.py`) is real work this reordering does not
remove, it only postpones ahead of an even lower-risk proof. This means the
Validation Plan's "net corpus size actually shrinks" criterion does **not**
apply to this reorder step — `agent-pull-requests` is a brand-new plugin,
not a converted existing one, so there is no pre-conversion baseline to
shrink against yet. That criterion still applies, unchanged, once
`agent-bridge`/the Phase 2+ set actually convert.

**Explicit non-goal this decision implies for Phase 1:** don't let the
vendored corpus balloon back into what it's replacing. The whole point is
fewer lines to fix N times, not the same line count moved one directory over.
Concretely:
- The canonical engine only carries the (a)/(b) functions from the Phase 0
  audit — genuinely per-service logic (agent-bridge's sibling-plugin installs,
  agent-dispatch's supervisor service, etc.) stays in each plugin's thin
  config/wrapper, never gets pulled into the engine "for convenience."
- Prefer **fewer, more configurable functions** over near-duplicate variants
  parameterized by a flag — a config-driven `Invoke-AgentServiceInstall`
  entry point, not a menu of twelve slightly-different `Invoke-XInstall`
  functions living in the same file.
- Track the vendored engine's own line count in the Validation Plan (below) —
  growth there is exactly the failure mode to watch for.

- [x] **Critical: adapt `tools/check-install-contract.py` (lines ~280-368) to
      the composed engine/wrapper split *before* converting any plugin.**
      That guard currently text-scans each plugin's own `install.*`/`init.*`
      for specific literal markers — `uv pip install`, the
      `install-contract:v3 versioned-venv` block marker, `stamp`/`provision`,
      source-kind blocks, and the v4 markers. A thin wrapper that moves those
      blocks into `scripts/installer-engine.*` will fail this existing guard
      even though the contract is still honored, just relocated. Either make
      the guard also inspect the vendored engine file(s) a wrapper sources
      (composed view), or keep the required literal marker seams present in
      each plugin's thin wrapper itself (not just the engine). Add regression
      coverage for whichever approach is chosen — this must land in the same
      PR as the first engine/wrapper conversion, not after.
      **Landed:** kept the required literal marker seams (self-stage/smoke-seam
      v4 blocks, `Get-SourceKind`/source-kind, `install-contract:v3
      versioned-venv`) in each plugin's own thin wrapper; `check-install-contract.py`
      was given a narrow, non-loophole addition that accepts a wrapper's
      `uv pip install`/schema-v3-manifest requirements as satisfied only when
      the wrapper both (a) dot-sources the vendored engine AND (b) actually
      calls the specific engine function (`Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient`/
      `Write-DeployManifest`) — merely referencing the engine file is not
      sufficient to pass. It also now calls `tools/sync-installer-engine.py`'s
      own drift check as part of the same run.
- [x] Create `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.ps1` and
      `installer-engine.sh` — the canonical (a) and (b) functions from Phase 0,
      parameterized by a small config object/associative-array (service name,
      package dir(s), launch command, `SupportsScheduledTask`,
      `SupportsZddCutover`, `SupportsDraining`, Python version pin, sibling
      installs list, etc.).
      **Landed** with the minimal-CLI-plugin function set the Phase 0 audit
      identified as necessary: `Invoke-NativeCapture`, `Test-IsSreModuleMismatch`,
      `Test-IsVenvCorruption`, `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient`,
      `Invoke-UvVenvResilient`, `Ensure-Uv`, `New-SignedVenv`,
      `Write-DeployManifest`, and a newly-written `Write-SimpleBinstub`
      (no shared function for this existed anywhere yet). Scheduled-task
      functions were correctly left out of the engine per Phase 0's (c)
      classification — `agent-pull-requests` needs none, and the
      per-service semantics genuinely differ (agent-dispatch/agent-logger/
      agent-index/agent-vault all have irreducibly different task lifecycles).
- [x] Write `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` mirroring
      `sync-versioned-runtime.py` exactly: canonical source ->
      byte-identical fan-out to `plugins/<plugin>/scripts/installer-engine.*`,
      `--check` mode for CI/pre-push, **opt-in adoption** (only plugins that
      already carry a `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy get synced — enables
      the phased rollout in Phase 2+ without forcing every plugin to migrate
      in one PR).
    - Consider whether this should be a mode of `sync-versioned-runtime.py`
      (both vendor from `libs/` into `scripts/`) or a fully separate tool —
      decide during Phase 1, record the decision here.
      **Decided:** a separate `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` tool, structured
      like `sync-versioned-runtime.py` (single canonical pair of files ->
      explicit adopter fan-out, `--check` drift detection), rather than a mode
      flag on the existing tool — the two sync targets (`versioned_runtime.py`
      vs. `installer-engine.ps1`/`.sh`) have independent adoption timelines
      (a plugin can adopt versioned-runtime without the installer engine, and
      vice versa) and keeping them as separate tools keeps that independence
      obvious.
- [x] Wire the new sync tool's `--check` into `tools/check-install-contract.py`
      and/or CI (`guards + lint`), matching how `versioned_runtime.py`
      byte-identity is already enforced.
- [x] Convert `agent-bridge`'s `install.ps1`/`install.sh` to source the vendored
      engine + a per-service config block, as the reference conversion.
      Validate with `agent-bridge`'s existing test suite
      (`test_install_sre_retry.py`, `test_install_venv_corruption_retry.py`,
      `test_installer_powershell51.py`, etc.) — these will need updating to
      extract functions from the vendored engine file instead of `install.ps1`
      directly (or the engine file needs its own equivalent test suite that
      plugin tests then just reference/import).
      **Done 2026-10-05:** after the low-risk `agent-pull-requests` pilot and
      the `agent-logger`/`agent-vault`/`agent-ssh` second-mover legs proved
      the canonical-reference wrapper shape, `agent-bridge` itself now adopts
      that same shared-engine form. The PowerShell/Linux retry regressions now
      read the shared engine for the truly shared helpers, while the
      bridge-specific build-artifact scrub / vendored-lib staging /
      service-lifecycle logic remains in the wrapper.
- [x] PR this phase; get it through the automated review gate; merge; deploy
      + verify **`agent-pull-requests`** (the reordered pilot) before starting
      Phase 2 / `agent-bridge`'s conversion.

### Phase 2+ — Roll remaining plugins onto the engine, one small batch per PR

> **Forward note (2026-09-29):** `agent-pull-requests`, the current proof
> adopter, no longer keeps a byte-vendored `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy
> on `dev`. By explicit operator-approved cross-effort decision (recorded in
> the Journal below), it now sources canonical
> `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly during authoring
> and promotion materializes the local copy back into the shipped payload.
> Future adopters in this Phase 2+ list should therefore go straight to that
> canonical-reference form rather than first landing a new byte-vendored dev
> copy. The runtime/install-time constraint that shipped payloads remain fully
> self-contained is unchanged.

**Non-exempt adopter set — every plugin this effort requires to actually
adopt the engine (10 plugins):** `agent-bridge`, `agent-logger`,
`agent-vault`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-index`,
`agent-dispatch`, `agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-machines`.
`agent-worktrees` is **not** part of this set — it carries a separately
recorded, permanent, non-adopting exception (below), so "every plugin in the
non-exempt adopter set has adopted" can be fully satisfied without it ever
adopting. `budget-guidance` is also not part of this set (see Context: not
an `agent-*` persistent-service plugin) and is never expected to adopt the
engine under this effort.

- [x] `agent-logger` (already has the pyvenv.cfg fix hand-applied today —
      good second-mover to prove the engine covers a second plugin's needs).
- [x] `agent-vault` (smaller installer, low risk).
- [x] `agent-ssh` (smaller installer, low risk).
- [ ] `agent-codespaces`, `agent-index` (each carries genuine per-service
      logic beyond the engine — sibling package installs / separate engine
      venv — prove the config schema handles these before doing the rest).
- [ ] `agent-dispatch`, `agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-machines`.
- [ ] **`agent-worktrees` is a decided permanent exception, not a deferred
      evaluation, and not part of the non-exempt adopter set above.** It is
      the control-plane plugin and by far the largest, most bespoke installer
      (3638 lines), and it already opts out of the related
      `resolve-runtime.*` fan-out for the same specialization reason (see
      `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py`'s `RESOLVER_BESPOKE` set). It does
      **not** adopt the shared engine in this effort's scope, now or later —
      its exclusion is intentional and permanent, not a TODO. Record this
      exception explicitly in `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` (an exclusion
      list, analogous to `RESOLVER_BESPOKE`) and in any completion-criteria/
      guard scope alongside it, so a future "is this effort done" check does
      not treat agent-worktrees' non-adoption as unfinished work.
- [ ] Retire the opt-in gate once every plugin in the **non-exempt adopter
      set** named above has adopted the engine, with `agent-worktrees`'
      permanent-exception record still present and accurate — mirroring how a
      fully-adopted primitive eventually becomes mandatory in
      `check-install-contract.py`.
      "Done" for this effort means *that* set is fully adopted, not "every
      plugin in the repo, no exceptions."

### Bug sweep — linked open bugs (2026-09-24)

_Correlated via a facility-driven sweep of open `bug`-labeled issues against active efforts (VEI + direct review). Not yet triaged into a numbered phase — listed here as upcoming work for whoever picks this effort back up._

- [ ] **#777** deploy/installer: reinstall overwrites the LIVE versions/<v> slot in place (non-immutable) -- stomps a running daemon's venv -> resume/start FileNotFoundError [WinError 2]
  - Overwriting a live versioned slot directly violates this effort's `immutable-versioned-runtime` feature.
- [ ] **#776** reconcile/deploy: same-version redeploy (dev296->dev296) reinstalls the slot -- version identity isn't content-addressed (commit:null), so an already-installed build can't be skipped
  - Non-content-addressed version identity directly violates this effort's `self-contained-runtime` feature.
- [ ] **#438** agent-bridge: <repo> update leaves the running daemon on the old version; installer should own the zero-downtime cutover (restart == drain-safe deploy)
  - The installer owning zero-downtime cutover is the same immutable-runtime-deploy scope this effort covers.

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Phase 0's audit findings are recorded and reviewed (via the effort PR)
      before any engine code is written — wrong assumptions here would ripple
      into every later phase.
- [ ] `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` passes in CI for every plugin
      that has adopted the engine, and fails (with a clear diagnostic) when a
      vendored copy is hand-edited or drifts from canonical.
- [ ] `tools/check-install-contract.py` passes for every converted plugin
      *without modification to lower its bar* — verifying it was adapted (per
      Phase 1's critical item) to recognize the contract seams from a
      composed engine/wrapper, not that the seams were quietly dropped from
      enforcement.
- [ ] Each converted plugin's full existing test suite still passes
      (`pytest`, run through this repo's normal bounded test runner), plus
      any install-contract guard (`tools/check-install-contract.py`).
- [ ] Each converted plugin is deployed to at least one real machine and its
      daemon/service verified healthy post-conversion — a behavior-preserving
      refactor that silently breaks a live service is the one failure mode
      this effort must not introduce.
- [ ] After Phase 1, deliberately reproduce a class of bug already fixed once
      in the canonical engine (e.g. the pyvenv.cfg/uv-exit-106 venv-corruption
      signature fixed via copilot-extensions#2482) against a
      **not-yet-migrated** plugin, confirm it's still present there, migrate
      that plugin, and confirm the same reproduction now passes — proving the
      "fix once, fixed everywhere on adopt" property this effort exists to
      deliver.
- [ ] `docs/install-contract.md` is updated to describe the new engine +
      config-schema pattern once Phase 1 lands, so it stays the accurate
      reference (not just this effort's private plan).
- [ ] **Net corpus size actually shrinks across the full rollout.** The final
      non-exempt adopter set's total installer line count (their
      `install.ps1`/`.sh` plus the shared `installer-engine.*`) must be
      materially smaller than the pre-conversion baseline — not just
      relocated. Record before/after line counts per converted plugin in the
      Journal. An individual adopter leg may temporarily grow when necessary
      shared safety/robustness fixes land in the engine or wrapper at the same
      time, but that growth must be called out explicitly in the Journal and
      then either (a) offset by later adopter conversions before this effort
      closes, or (b) carried by an explicit follow-up tightening item in the
      Plan/Validation Plan rather than silently treated as satisfied.

## Proposal

**Phase 0 audit findings (2026-09-22):**

| Function / concern | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Invoke-NativeCapture` | (a) | Byte-identical shape across `agent-bridge`/`agent-worktrees`/`agent-logger`: capture scriptblock output, return `{ExitCode; Output}`. |
| `Test-IsSreModuleMismatch` | (a) | One-arg predicate matching "SRE module mismatch". |
| `Test-IsVenvCorruption` | (a) | One-arg predicate matching "failed to locate pyvenv.cfg" / "exit code:\s*106". |
| `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` | (a), minor variation | Real source is `agent-bridge`/`agent-logger` (not the smaller pilots) — 3/6/10s retry on SRE mismatch. |
| `Invoke-UvVenvResilient` | (a)/(b) | Same source; retries SRE mismatch + missing pyvenv.cfg. Venv path + uv args are the real parameters. |
| `Ensure-Uv` | (b) | Policy varies per plugin (PATH check, tool dir, index resolution, repair) — needs config params (InstallRoot, ToolDirectory, AcquireIfMissing). |
| `New-SignedVenv` | (b) | Signed-base-Python preference + Authenticode validation + uv fallback is shared; Python pin and validation hooks vary — needs real parameters. |
| Binstub writing | (b) minimal path, (c) service-heavy | No clean shared function existed anywhere; `Write-SimpleBinstub` is genuinely new code, generalized from the simplest existing self-provisioning launcher pattern (`budget-guidance`), cross-checked against `agent-ssh`/`agent-vault`. |
| Deploy manifest writing | (b) | Schema-version-3 shape + `source` block is shared; service-specific fields vary — needs an `AdditionalFields` escape hatch. |
| Scheduled-task functions | (c) | Not shared — agent-dispatch/agent-logger/agent-index/agent-vault each have irreducibly different task lifecycles. Out of scope for the engine entirely (a minimal on-demand CLI plugin needs none). |
| Versioned-runtime slot handling | already a shared primitive | `libs/versioned-runtime/versioned_runtime.py`, synced via the pre-existing `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py` (opt-in: any plugin with `pyproject.toml` + an installer is auto-discovered as an adopter — no registry edit needed to add a new plugin). The installer engine calls this primitive rather than reimplementing it. |

**`tools/check-install-contract.py`'s pre-existing enforced contract** (verified
by reading the file, not just this table): both install.ps1+install.sh (or
init.ps1+init.sh); literal `uv pip install`; no runtime `PYTHONPATH` into a
package `lib/` dir; schema-version-3 manifest with a `source` block; Windows
launchers must avoid unsigned console-script `.exe` trampolines and invoke
the venv Python with `-m`; byte-identical `scripts/versioned_runtime.py` +
literal `install-contract:v3 versioned-venv` marker; `stamp`/`provision`
actions; byte-identical `Get-SourceKind`/source-kind blocks and v4
self-stage/smoke-seam blocks per language.

**Existing sync-tool templates evaluated:** `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py`
(closest match — single canonical file pair, explicit/auto-discovered
adopters, byte-identical fan-out, `--check` drift detection) and
`tools/sync-installation-context.py` (better for multiple files per adopter,
not needed here since the engine is exactly two files). Followed the
`sync-versioned-runtime.py` shape for `tools/sync-installer-engine.py`.

**Minimal function set a small new CLI plugin actually needs** (proven live
by `agent-pull-requests`): `Ensure-Uv` -> `New-SignedVenv` ->
`Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` (package install) -> `Write-SimpleBinstub` ->
`Write-DeployManifest`, plus the pre-existing `versioned_runtime.py` for the
immutable-versioned-runtime slot contract. No scheduled task, no sibling
installs, no service-specific config needed for this class of plugin.

## Journal

### 2026-09-12 — Kickoff
- Effort created directly off the operator's request, immediately following
  a venv-corruption fix (pyvenv.cfg missing after a shared uv-managed
  interpreter race, PR copilot-extensions#2482) — the session that surfaced
  this exact pain point (fixed agent-bridge, then had to hand-port the
  identical fix into agent-logger).
- Grounded in existing precedent: `docs/install-contract.md`'s explicit
  vendoring-not-runtime-sharing constraint, `versioned_runtime.py` +
  `sync-versioned-runtime.py` (the closed `uniform-runtime-resolution` effort)
  as the pattern to extend, and `check-vendored-libs-sync.py` as a related but
  distinct existing guard (Python packages, not installer scripts).
- Confirmed scope via line-count audit: 12 `pyproject.toml`-bearing runtime
  plugins per `tools/check-docs-consistency.py`'s definition (one,
  `budget-guidance`, has no venv/uv engine logic and is out of this effort's
  actual scope -- see Context), ~20,000+ lines of
  installer PowerShell alone, most of it mechanically duplicated engine logic.
- Plan phased explicitly to mirror `uniform-runtime-resolution`'s landed
  discipline: audit first (Phase 0), canonical engine + one reference plugin
  (Phase 1), then small per-plugin rollout batches (Phase 2+) — never one
  giant cross-plugin PR.
- Not yet started: Phase 0 audit. This effort's own plan has not yet cleared
  the automated review gate.

### 2026-09-12 — Design decision: vendoring over git-fetch
- Before Phase 1 started, evaluated an operator-proposed alternative: ship a
  tiny per-plugin bootstrap stub that fetches the canonical engine directly
  via `uv`'s pinned git+subdirectory VCS support instead of byte-vendoring it.
  Confirmed technically feasible (`uv` is pip-compatible for
  `git+URL@rev#subdirectory=path`, has its own git support).
- Decided **against** git-fetch for now, in favor of byte-vendoring: git-fetch
  adds a mandatory network dependency to every install/update (today's flow is
  offline after the payload copy, save precedented uv/PyPI touches), and its
  fetched-engine cache would reintroduce the exact "shared cache, concurrent
  writers, partial-write corruption" hazard class already fixed once via
  copilot-extensions#2482 — just relocated, not eliminated. It would also reverse
  `docs/install-contract.md`'s documented self-containment constraint, which
  is a bigger, separate decision than this effort's actual trigger requires.
  Full reasoning recorded inline above Phase 1 (`### Design decision —
  vendoring over git-fetch`).
- Kept a clean off-ramp: `libs/installer-engine/` will carry a real
  `pyproject.toml` from Phase 1 on, so it remains a valid git-fetch target
  later if the cache/offline questions get solved in a future effort.
- Added an explicit non-goal + Validation Plan item: the vendored corpus must
  actually shrink per converted plugin, not just relocate the same line count
  — tracking before/after line counts per plugin going forward.

### 2026-09-22 — Phase 0 audit landed; Phase 1 engine built, `agent-pull-requests` as reordered pilot

- Ran the Phase 0 audit for real (see `## Proposal` above): read the actual
  `install.ps1`/`install.sh` bodies in `agent-bridge`, `agent-logger`,
  `agent-vault`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-worktrees`, and `budget-guidance` rather
  than assuming the effort's own guessed classification was correct going in.
  One correction found: the resilient uv retry helpers
  (`Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient`/`Invoke-UvVenvResilient`) actually live in
  `agent-bridge`/`agent-logger`, not the smaller `agent-vault`/`agent-ssh`
  pilots as initially assumed — used the real source for extraction.
- **Reordered Phase 1's pilot**: operator explicitly approved building the
  real engine now and converting `agent-pull-requests` (new, no daemon, no
  existing users) first, instead of `agent-bridge` as originally planned —
  see the Design decision recorded above Phase 1. `agent-bridge`'s own
  conversion remains open, unscoped-down follow-through.
- Landed `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.ps1`/`.sh` (the (a)/(b)
  functions from the audit, plus a newly-written `Write-SimpleBinstub` that
  didn't exist anywhere yet), `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` (mirrors
  `sync-versioned-runtime.py`'s shape), and a narrow, non-loophole addition to
  `tools/check-install-contract.py` (accepts a wrapper's `uv pip
  install`/schema-v3-manifest requirements as satisfied only when it both
  vendors the engine AND actually calls the specific resilient-install/
  manifest-writer functions — not merely referencing the engine file).
- Converted `plugins/agent-pull-requests` into a real runtime plugin: kept
  every contract-required literal seam (v4 self-stage/smoke-seam,
  `Get-SourceKind`, `install-contract:v3 versioned-venv`, stamp/provision
  actions) in its own thin wrapper, dot-sourcing the vendored engine only for
  the genuinely shared helper bodies. Added it to `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py`'s
  adopter set automatically (auto-discovered by `pyproject.toml` + installer
  presence — no registry edit needed).
- **Validated for real, not just asserted**: `tools/sync-installer-engine.py
  --check` correctly fails before syncing and passes after;
  `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py --check` passes across all 13 plugins;
  `tools/check-install-contract.py` passes (13 plugins, unchanged pass for
  the other 12); `tools/check-version-consistency.py`/`check-docs-consistency.py`
  clean; the plugin's own 5-test pytest suite passes. Removed a stray manual
  `pip install`-ed copy of `agent-pull-requests` from this machine's global
  Python first, then ran the **real** `install.ps1` end-to-end: it vendored
  uv, built a signed venv, installed the package, wrote a schema-v3 deploy
  manifest, and deployed a real binstub at `<home>\.local\bin\agent-pull-requests.ps1`.
  Invoked that exact binstub directly: `agent-pull-requests status --repo
  <owner>/<repo> --number <n>` returned real live PR data — proving
  the whole chain end-to-end through the real installer, not a manual
  workaround.
- **Not done in this slice** (tracked, not forgotten): `agent-bridge`'s actual
  conversion (Phase 1's original reference target) and all of Phase 2+'s
  remaining adopters. The live end-to-end proof above was Windows-only; a
  POSIX (`install.sh`) live-install proof is still open, worth deciding
  whether each future adopter phase requires one rather than only repo-level
  guards.

### 2026-09-22 — PR #3287 merged: 10 real review findings fixed, no shortcuts

- Operator explicitly rejected the earlier session's ad-hoc `pip install`
  workaround ("use the proper vendored installer engine from the get-go, no
  shortcuts") and confirmed the Phase-0-then-Phase-1-with-a-reordered-pilot
  plan (Design decision above) before any code was written.
- Landed `libs/installer-engine/` + `tools/sync-installer-engine.py` +
  `agent-pull-requests`'s conversion as `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3287`.
  Copilot's automated review found **10 real, non-cosmetic** issues across
  three review rounds (concurrency/immutability bugs, not style nits) — all
  fixed before merge, none dismissed or worked around:
  1. POSIX binstub lock had no `flock`-unavailable fallback and never
     released fd 9 before `exec`, so a successful lock blocked every other
     invocation for the dispatched process's entire lifetime.
  2. Cleanup/mark-complete helper failures were silently swallowed in both
     `.ps1`/`.sh`, letting install continue into an incomplete/protected slot.
  3. `-Force`/`--force` could reach the venv/install step even for an
     already-complete, currently-active immutable slot, and the
     interpreter-presence-only build gate missed a killed-build-left-no-marker
     case entirely — the exact hazard the versioned-runtime contract exists
     to prevent.
  4. The install-contract's new engine exemption was a naive substring check
     (a comment mentioning the function name alone would bypass the
     requirement) — tightened to require a real dot-source/include plus a
     real call shape, with regression fixtures for both the legitimate pass
     and a deliberate bypass attempt.
  5. The POSIX uv bootstrap piped the mutable `astral.sh/uv/install.sh`
     script with no version pin or integrity check, unlike the Windows path's
     pinned-version + SHA-256-verified download — brought to parity.
  6. `ensure_uv`'s diagnostic lines leaked onto stdout ahead of its returned
     path, so `UV_CMD=$(ensure_uv ...)`-style capture could try to execute
     log text as a command on a fresh host with no uv on PATH.
  7. A custom `-InstallDir`/`--install-dir` wasn't forwarded to the
     self-provisioning binstub's `provision` invocation, so first-use
     provisioning silently installed to the wrong (default) root.
  8. POSIX interpreter resolution for `mark-complete` checked the legacy
     link/ambient Python before the just-built versioned slot's own
     interpreter, so a host with no ambient Python (uv-provisioned Python
     only) never got a completion marker despite a working install.
  9. No single lock covered the whole install transaction (slot
     create/install/activate/manifest), only the deployed binstub's own
     first-use lock — a manual `install.sh` run and a binstub-triggered
     provision could race each other on the same slot.
  10. The installed Windows binstub/`.cmd` resolved `pwsh`/PowerShell via
      ambient `Get-Command`/bare names, unlike the payload shim's
      restricted-PATH-safe absolute `%SystemRoot%\System32\where.exe` +
      absolute-path fallback — brought to parity.
- Also caught and fixed two things the review flagged that weren't concurrency
  bugs: a genuinely missing `tools/check-bootstrap-sync.py` `FAMILIES`
  registration (the plugin's `bootstrap-check.ps1`/`.sh` weren't byte-identical
  to the shared `versioned-venv/psscriptroot` family template — fixed by
  copying the real template verbatim and registering the plugin), and a
  required PR-description "Documentation impact" statement.
- One operational hazard hit and recovered from mid-session: an accidental
  `git stash pop` in the shared repo checkout popped a stale, unrelated stash
  entry from a completely different historical session (git stash is
  per-repository, not per-worktree) and produced a large merge-conflict mess
  touching unrelated plugins. Recovered cleanly with `git reset --hard HEAD`
  before anything was pushed — the stash entry itself was untouched/preserved
  throughout. Lesson: never `git stash`/`git stash pop` in a shared
  multi-worktree repo checkout without first confirming the stash stack is
  actually empty or owned by this session.
- Final state: all 10 findings fixed and validated for real (every repo
  guard + the plugin's own test suite + the install-contract's own new
  regression fixtures), plus a full clean-reinstall + idempotent-reinstall
  proof and a real `agent-pull-requests status` call through the deployed
  binstub, immediately before merge. Squash-merged; worktree finalized.
- **Genuinely still open** (not silently dropped): `agent-bridge`'s actual
  Phase 1 conversion, all Phase 2+ adopters, and a POSIX live-install proof
  lane (this session's end-to-end proof was Windows-only, matching the
  machine it ran on).

### 2026-09-22 — Two unrelated bugs found landing #3287, fixed separately

- `#3289`: a pre-existing `agent-containers` `__version__` fallback stale by
  one dev increment, failing `check-version-consistency` for every open PR
  on `main` at the time. Trivial fix, unrelated to the engine work.
- `#3304`: `agent-worktrees`' own `instructions/worktree-context-guide
  .instructions.md` template had grown to 4380 bytes, past
  `customizing-copilot`'s `MAX_TEMPLATE_BYTES = 4096` projection budget —
  the exact same bug class as the earlier `context-handoff` fix
  (private downstream repo #404 -> upstream #3250), this time hitting
  `agent-worktrees` and hard-blocking `push-changes`/finalize validation in
  *every* repo that resolves this projection (discovered when it blocked a
  routine knowledge-repo effort-doc push, unrelated to this effort). Trimmed
  to 3938 bytes, preserving every safety point in the trimmed sections.

### 2026-09-22 — Hardened enforcement: closed two real gaps in the new guards

Operator asked to make sure CI + pre-push actually enforce the vendored
installer-engine copies staying byte-identical across every consumption
site — not just assert that they do. Two real gaps found and closed
(`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3326`):

1. `tools/sync-installer-engine.py`'s `verify()` only checked plugins
   already listed in its `ADOPTERS` tuple — a plugin that hand-copied
   `scripts/installer-engine.*` without being added to `ADOPTERS` would
   drift silently forever, invisible to both CI and pre-push. Added
   `unregistered_adopters()`, mirroring `tools/sync-installation-context
   .py`'s existing pattern for the identical class of gap. Verified live: put
   a copy of the canonical file in an unregistered plugin's `scripts/`,
   confirmed `--check` failed with a clear message, reverted, confirmed
   clean again.
2. Neither `tools/test_check_install_contract.py` (the substring-bypass
   regression fixtures added in #3287) nor a new
   `tools/test_sync_installer_engine.py` (covering the new detection above)
   were wired into any CI job — they only ran when invoked by hand. Both are
   now explicit `guards + lint` steps in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Also independently re-verified the *existing* enforcement is real, not just
present: deliberately drifted a vendored copy and confirmed both
`check-install-contract.py` and the actual `tools/hooks/pre-push` script
(active via `core.hooksPath=tools/hooks` in this checkout) block on it
*before* the push leaves the machine, then reverted. One unrelated,
pre-existing CI failure (`worktree-manager`'s `test_doctor_human_render_
matches_exhaustive_json`, a missing `_render_dropin_registry_report`
attribute — the same class of unrelated `main` drift hit twice earlier this
session) did not block merge; `merge state: clean` confirmed it isn't a
required check.

### 2026-09-23 — `agent-pull-requests` verb parity: `create`/`merge`/`wait` implemented

Resumed via context handoff (again worked around a broken `consume_handoff`
MCP tool — `Extension disconnected before responding to tool call`, three
consecutive attempts — by reading the file-backed handoff JSON directly
from a private repo state-root `worktrees/<id>/handoff/handoff-<id>.json` path and
`bind-session`ing manually; this is now the *second* distinct
`consume_handoff` failure mode hit across two sessions and still not
reported upstream).

Picked the smaller of the two roster options (vs. `agent-bridge`'s Phase 1
installer-engine conversion, a live production daemon deferred as
appropriately larger/riskier for one sitting):

- Implemented all three previously-stubbed verbs in
  `plugins/agent-pull-requests/src/agent_pull_requests/__main__.py`:
  - `create`: `gh pr create --repo <owner/repo> --head <branch> [--base ...]
    --title ... [--body ...] [--draft]`, no local checkout required (proved
    the exact transport works with a live `--dry-run` round-trip through
    `agent-worktrees repos gh ... -- pr create --dry-run`, no PR created);
    parses the created PR's number from `gh`'s printed URL.
  - `merge`: `gh pr merge` with `--squash` (default) / `--merge` /
    `--rebase`, `--auto`, `--delete-branch`.
  - `wait`: polls `status` until `MERGED`/`CLOSED` or a timeout; distinct
    exit codes (0 merged, 1 closed-unmerged/status-error, 3 timed-out).
  - All three reuse the existing `agent-worktrees repos gh` transport and
    the established leading-diagnostic-tolerant stdout parsing (added a
    plain-text sibling, `_strip_leading_diagnostic`, alongside the existing
    JSON-tail parser).
- Added unit tests for each new verb (parser-flag tests + JSON-output smoke
  tests via monkeypatched `_github_create`/`_github_merge`/`_github_status`),
  bumped the plugin version (`0.1.0-dev2` -> `0.1.0-dev3`) across
  `plugin.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`__init__.py`, and corrected the plugin
  README/CLI-reference/marketplace description, which had gone stale
  describing a payload-only, status-only scaffold from before the real
  installer landed.
- Landed as `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3363` (squash-merged): 15/15
  plugin tests passing, `check-version-consistency.py` /
  `check-docs-consistency.py` / `check-install-contract.py` all clean, a
  live `status` call against the private downstream repo's PR #491 still correct
  through the module (unchanged transport), full CI green (one prior
  unrelated `worktree-manager` drift failure not present this run).
- **Genuinely still open**: `agent-bridge`'s Phase 1 installer-engine
  conversion (the effort's original pilot target), Phase 2+'s remaining
  adopters, a POSIX live-install proof lane (all proofs to date are
  Windows-only), and the cross-repo documentation sweep pointing consumers
  at `agent-pull-requests` instead of `agent-worktrees`' worktree-bound PR
  verbs.

### 2026-09-23 — `docs/install-contract.md` updated for the engine + a real, unrelated CI-blocking bug fixed along the way

- Considered `agent-bridge`'s Phase 1 conversion next (per the roster), but
  its `install.ps1` is 2880 lines with many non-trivial call sites
  (scheduled-task/service lifecycle, the ZDD cutover, legacy
  project-service migration, several sibling-plugin installs) driving a
  live production daemon other machines/sessions depend on right now. A
  faithful "no shortcuts" conversion needs the same multi-round review
  rigor the much smaller `agent-pull-requests` pilot needed (10 real bugs
  across 3 rounds) plus full existing-test-suite adaptation and a
  real-machine post-conversion health check per this effort's own
  Validation Plan -- not something to start and leave half-finished in one
  sitting. Deferred it rather than rush it; still the natural next slice
  for a session with more room.
- Picked a smaller, explicitly-required, safely-completable item instead:
  the Validation Plan's own "`docs/install-contract.md` is updated to
  describe the new engine + config-schema pattern once Phase 1 lands" —
  overdue since the engine itself (and its first real adopter,
  `agent-pull-requests`) already landed in #3287/#3363, but the doc never
  mentioned `libs/installer-engine/` at all.
- Added a new "Shared installer-engine helpers" section (what the engine
  covers vs. deliberately leaves to each plugin, the vendoring-over-git-
  fetch rationale, the phased opt-in adoption model, `agent-worktrees`'
  permanent exception) plus a matching Enforcement bullet for
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check`. Landed as
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3417`.
- **Found and fixed one real, unrelated bug along the way**: PR #3417's own
  CI failed on the required `guards + lint` check with a
  `check-version-consistency.py` violation -- `worktree-manager`'s
  `pyproject.toml` (bumped to `0.1.0-dev74` by an unrelated, already-merged
  PR #3414) had drifted from `src/worktree_manager/__init__.py`'s
  `__version__` (still `0.1.0-dev73`). Confirmed via `git show
  origin/main:...` that this was already broken on `main` itself, not
  introduced by this PR, and would block every other PR's `guards + lint`
  check the same way. Bumped `__init__.py` to match and pushed it as a
  second commit on the same PR (matches this session's established pattern
  of fixing a blocking, unrelated bug found along the way -- see the
  `#3289`/`#3304` entries above). Verified `check-version-consistency.py`
  clean before pushing; full CI green afterward.
- **Genuinely still open**: unchanged from the prior entry --
  `agent-bridge`'s Phase 1 conversion, Phase 2+'s remaining adopters, a
  POSIX live-install proof lane, and the cross-repo documentation sweep are
  all still open follow-through.

### 2026-09-26 — Cross-reference: a pointer-based mechanism may supersede byte-vendoring here
- A new sibling effort, `efforts/active/vendor-pointer-generalization`,
  proposes generalizing the DRY vendor-pointer pattern (built by
  `vendored-doc-pointers` + `dev-branch-release-pipeline`, currently applied
  to docs and designed-but-unapplied for shared libs) to this effort's own
  installer-engine surface, as a Phase 2 evaluation. That effort's own Plan
  explicitly commits to coordinating with this effort's driver before
  changing this effort's chosen mechanism (`sync-installer-engine.py
  --check`, a drift detector) — not forking the design unilaterally. No
  mechanism change is proposed or made here; this is a forward pointer only,
  so this effort's own driver sees it on next resume.

### 2026-09-29 — Narrow operator-approved revisit: dev-time canonical reference adopted for the shared engine proof point

- The 2026-09-12 "vendoring over git-fetch" decision has now been **narrowly
  revisited with explicit operator approval**, but only for the *dev-time*
  authoring shape of the shared installer engine. The original decision's
  core reasoning still fully stands: a shipped plugin install/update must NOT
  fetch or resolve a shared module from a sibling plugin, git checkout, or
  network location at install/runtime; the payload a real user receives from
  `main` remains completely self-contained.
- What changed is only how `dev` keeps the shared engine in sync. The proof
  adopter (`agent-pull-requests`, still this effort's only current adopter)
  now sources canonical
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly during
  authoring, with **no** local `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy remaining on
  `dev`. Promotion/materialization then copies canonical back into
  `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` and rewrites the wrapper's source line
  to the local form before anything ships to `main`, preserving the original
  self-contained install/runtime contract exactly.
- `vendor-pointer-generalization` Phase 2 landed the supporting changes in
  this same coordinated leg: `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` now
  recognizes this canonical-reference form as valid, `tools/check-install-
  contract.py` accepts the wrapper + real engine-function-call shape with the
  canonical relative-path source line, and both `materialize_main.py` and
  `preview_release.py` now perform the promotion-time/scratch-preview
  copy-then-rewrite.
- Consequence for this effort's future rollout only: the remaining Phase 2+
  adopters listed above should go straight to this canonical-reference form
  when their individual adoption PRs happen, rather than first creating a
  fresh byte-vendored dev copy. This does **not** redesign the effort into a
  runtime/install-time shared module, and it does **not** reverse the
  documented rejection of git-fetch / shared install-time resolution.

### 2026-10-05 — `agent-logger` adopted the shared installer engine as the second mover

- Converted `plugins/agent-logger/scripts/install.sh` and
  `plugins/agent-logger/scripts/install.ps1` to the same canonical-reference
  wrapper shape `agent-pull-requests` already uses: both now source
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly on `dev`, keep
  their own contract seams (`install-contract:v3 versioned-venv`,
  source-kind/self-stage/smoke-seam blocks) in the wrapper, and retain only
  the genuinely per-service logic that Phase 0 classified as non-engine
  (`Ensure-UvIndex`, agent-logger's extra trampoline cleanup, payload snapshot
  publication, config-repo discovery, systemd/Scheduled Task wiring,
  self-provisioning wrapper publication, and the install-lock/stale-payload
  guards). `tools/installer_engine_ref.py` now registers `agent-logger` as an
  adopter so `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` enforces the wrapper form.
- **Fix-once / fixed-everywhere proof:** before this conversion,
  `agent-logger` still carried its own hand-maintained copies of the
  pyvenv.cfg / uv-exit-106 retry logic from copilot-extensions#2482 in both
  `install.sh` and `install.ps1` (`_is_venv_corruption` /
  `_uv_venv_resilient`, `Test-IsVenvCorruption` / `Invoke-UvVenvResilient`).
  After conversion those duplicate functions are gone from the wrapper
  entirely; the wrapper now sources the canonical engine and the relevant
  regression tests (`test_install_sre_retry.py`,
  `test_install_venv_corruption_retry.py`,
  `test_install_signed_python_probe.py`) extract their helper bodies from
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.ps1` / `.sh`, proving the bug fix is
  now inherited from one shared source instead of preserved by a second manual
  port.
- **Line-count / corpus result:** wrapper-only installer lines shrank from
  `install.sh` 1215 -> 1193 (-22) and `install.ps1` 1637 -> 1506 (-131), for
  a combined wrapper drop of 2852 -> 2699 (-153). The canonical engine grew by
  3 lines on the POSIX side (368 -> 371) to fail closed when `uv venv` returns
  success without leaving `pyvenv.cfg`; the PowerShell engine stayed flat at
  462 lines. Net result for this conversion leg: **150 lines removed** from the
  combined agent-logger + shared-engine corpus, not just relocated.
- Validation completed here:
  - `python3 tools/check-install-contract.py`
  - `python3 tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check`

  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-logger --reinstall --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`494 passed, 17 skipped`; wrapper runner summary `247 passed, 7 skipped`)
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-pull-requests --reinstall --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`21 passed`; wrapper runner summary `21 passed`) to prove the shared-engine bash fix did not regress the existing pilot adopter
  - Real POSIX install proof: ran `plugins/agent-logger/scripts/install.sh
    install --install-dir <scoped session scratch>` against the live checkout
    with the real user systemd instance, confirmed the scoped timer became
    active, `status` reported the installed runtime healthy, the versioned
    slot's Python imported `agent_logger`, `yaml`, and `plugin_activation`
    successfully, and the published snapshot carried payload-local
    `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` copies with both installer source
    lines rewritten to the local form before the first-use installer path could
    consume them. Then removed the scoped timer again with `uninstall --install-dir ...`.
    Also re-confirmed the `dev` checkout keeps **no** local
    `plugins/agent-logger/scripts/installer-engine.*` copy afterward.
- Validation not possible in this Linux/WSL session:
  - No real Windows install lane / Task Scheduler exercise for
    `install.ps1`; instead validated that lane through the full plugin test
    suite plus a `pwsh` parse check of `plugins/agent-logger/scripts/install.ps1`.
  - No broader multi-machine production deployment beyond the scoped local
    timer proof above.

### 2026-10-05 — installer-test hygiene sweep for the next adopter lane

- Added `installer-test-hygiene.md` to record a bounded sweep across the 10
  installer-engine adoption targets, starting from the concrete `agent-logger`
  churn in PR #5228 and genericized publicly as issue #5245.
- Fixed the concrete hygiene gaps found:
  - `plugins/agent-logger/tests/conftest.py` +
    `plugins/agent-logger/tests/test_scaffold.py`: real temp-repo `git`
    fixtures now scrub ambient git-routing env vars and use a 20-second
    timeout, so they cannot silently follow a caller's `GIT_DIR` /
    `GIT_WORK_TREE` into some other checkout or hang forever.
  - `plugins/agent-logger/tests/test_install_binstub.py`: the real
    stamp/provision/first-use snapshot tests now build a temp-rooted env that
    mirrors `tools/plugin_test_containment.py`'s HOME/XDG/temp containment
    instead of overriding only a subset of roots; the PowerShell task-warning
    harness there is also now time-bounded.
  - `plugins/agent-logger/tests/test_install_signed_python_probe.py`,
    `test_install_sre_retry.py`, `test_install_venv_corruption_retry.py`, and
    `test_install_sync_repo_config.py`: added explicit 20-second timeouts to
    the previously unbounded local shell/PowerShell harness subprocesses.
  - `plugins/agent-bridge/tests/test_install_sre_retry.py` and
    `test_install_venv_corruption_retry.py`: applied the same timeout fix to
    the analogous PowerShell retry harnesses.
  - `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_self_provisioning_binstub.py`: real
    bash binstub runs now execute under temp-rooted HOME/XDG/temp dirs and have
    an explicit 20-second timeout.
- Spot-check result for the other next-wave plugins (`agent-vault`,
  `agent-ssh`, `agent-index`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-containers`,
  `agent-mcp`, `agent-machines`): their installer-adjacent harnesses already
  carried the containment this sweep was looking for (explicit subprocess
  bounds and/or temp-rooted homes), so no code changes were needed in this
  round.
- Validation completed here:
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-logger --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`496 passed, 17 skipped`; wrapper runner summary `247 passed, 7 skipped`)
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-bridge --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS on retry after one transient failure in
    `tests/test_codespace_spawner.py::test_relay_ping_probe_command_round_trips_against_real_listener`
    (`warning-only first run failure; subsequent full-suite pass`)
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-codespaces --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`688 passed, 1 skipped`; wrapper runner summary additional sub-suites `497 passed, 11 skipped`, `355 passed, 1 skipped`, `65 passed`)

### 2026-10-05 — `agent-vault` adopted the shared installer engine

- Converted `plugins/agent-vault/scripts/install.sh` and
  `plugins/agent-vault/scripts/install.ps1` to the canonical-reference wrapper
  form: both now source
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly on `dev`, and
  `tools/installer_engine_ref.py` now registers `agent-vault` as an adopter so
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` enforces that form.
- Removed the duplicated wrapper-local installer-engine bodies:
  POSIX now uses shared `ensure_uv`, `new_signed_venv`,
  `invoke_uv_pip_install_resilient`, `write_deploy_manifest`, and
  `write_simple_binstub`; PowerShell now uses shared `Ensure-Uv`,
  `New-SignedVenv`, `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient`,
  `Write-DeployManifest`, and `Write-SimpleBinstub`. Genuinely per-service
  logic stayed local: agent-vault's versioned-runtime helpers, downgrade
  guard, the PowerShell-side pip→uv index bridge (`Ensure-UvIndex`),
  KeePassXC prerequisite check + askpass helper, systemd/Scheduled Task
  lifecycle, Windows drain-safe fixed-endpoint cutover, and the PowerShell
  snapshot materialization needed for first-use provisioning from a stamped
  payload.
- The Windows `stamp` path now materializes both the canonical installer-engine
  pair and the external `[tool.uv.sources]` libs (`zdd`, `agent-procutil`,
  `single-instance-lease`) into the published snapshot before the staged
  payload marker flips over, so first-use provisioning from a dev-time
  canonical-reference wrapper still ships a self-contained snapshot.
- **Line-count / corpus result:** wrapper-only installer lines shrank from
  `install.sh` 930 -> 831 (-99) and `install.ps1` 1253 -> 1246 (-7), for a
  combined wrapper drop of 2183 -> 2077 (**-106**). The canonical engine grew
  by 3 POSIX lines (`installer-engine.sh` 376 -> 379) to preserve the
  pre-existing nonzero failure contract when provisioning reports success but
  leaves no resolvable runtime; `installer-engine.ps1` stayed flat at 462
  lines. Net result for this conversion leg: **103 lines removed** from the
  combined agent-vault + shared-engine corpus instead of merely relocating
  them.
- Validation completed here:
  - `python3 tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --check`
  - `python3 tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check`
  - `python3 tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py`
  - `python3 tools/check-install-contract.py`
  - `python3 tools/check-version-consistency.py`
  - `python3 tools/check-module-size.py`
  - `python3 tools/check-docs-consistency.py`
  - `python3 tools/check-changefile-presence.py --base origin/dev`
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-vault --reinstall --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`260 passed, 12 skipped`)
  - `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-pull-requests --reinstall --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`21 passed`) after the shared POSIX binstub helper picked up the
    same success-without-runtime exit fix this leg needed for agent-vault
  - Focused follow-up after the initial full-suite run surfaced only the two
    installer preinstall-loop guards; the review-fix pass then re-ran only the
    affected installer regressions (`preinstall_loop`, `uv_index`,
    `snapshot_only`) before the final all-green full suite:
    `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-vault --reinstall --admission-wait 540 -k "uv_index or snapshot_only or preinstall_loop"`
    -> PASS (`11 passed, 1 skipped, 260 deselected`). No other repeated full
    suite ran between the initial failing full run and the final all-green one.
  - Real POSIX install proof: with `HOME` redirected into the session-state
    files area and `--no-service --install-dir <scoped root>`, the converted
    `plugins/agent-vault/scripts/install.sh install` completed end-to-end,
    built the versioned runtime slot, imported `agent_vault` successfully,
    wrote a deploy manifest with the correct local source metadata, and left
    **no** `plugins/agent-vault/scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` copy in the
    `dev` checkout afterward.
- Validation not possible in this Linux/WSL session:
  - No real Windows `.ps1` install / Scheduled Task lane on a Windows host;
    that path was covered here by the full plugin suite plus a PowerShell parse
    check only.
- Test-hygiene note: no new containment bug class was found in agent-vault's
  installer-adjacent tests. The touched preinstall-loop guards already used
  temp-rooted work dirs and explicit 30-second subprocess timeouts; the new
  PowerShell snapshot/uv-index regressions were written to the same model
  (isolated HOME/XDG/temp roots, stripped inherited Python env, explicit
  subprocess timeouts), and the existing preinstall-loop guards only needed
  shape updates so they continued extracting/exercising the refactored wrapper
  logic.

### 2026-10-05 — `agent-ssh` adopted the shared installer engine

- Converted `plugins/agent-ssh/scripts/install.sh` and
  `plugins/agent-ssh/scripts/install.ps1` to the canonical-reference wrapper
  form: both now source
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly on `dev`, and
  `tools/installer_engine_ref.py` now registers `agent-ssh` as an adopter so
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` enforces that form.
- Removed the wrapper-local copies of the shared engine logic:
  POSIX now uses shared `ensure_uv`, `new_signed_venv`,
  `invoke_uv_pip_install_resilient`, `write_deploy_manifest`, and
  `write_simple_binstub`; PowerShell now uses shared `Ensure-Uv`,
  `New-SignedVenv`, `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient`,
  `Write-DeployManifest`, and `Write-SimpleBinstub`. Genuinely per-service
  logic stayed local: the vendored-lib resolution helpers, the
  `agent-ssh`-specific package-install dependency list, versioned-runtime
  helpers, PATH persistence, the session-start hook deployment, and the
  snapshot materialization needed for first-use provisioning from a stamped
  payload.
- The stamped snapshot path now materializes both the canonical installer-engine
  pair and the canonical-on-`dev` `[tool.uv.sources]` libraries
  (`agent-procutil`, `ssh-manager`, `venue-copilot`, `zdd`,
  `remote-login-shell`) into the published snapshot and rewrites the wrapper
  source lines to the local `scripts/installer-engine.*` form before
  first-use provisioning, so the shipped snapshot remains self-contained even
  though the `dev` checkout keeps no local `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy.
- Shared-engine follow-up found and fixed in the same leg: PowerShell's
  `Write-DeployManifest` now falls back to the host name when
  `$env:COMPUTERNAME` is absent, so Linux/WSL `pwsh` validation can exercise
  the shared manifest writer without a null dereference.
- **Line-count / corpus result:** wrapper-only installer lines grew from
  `install.sh` 701 -> 817 (+116) and `install.ps1` 899 -> 990 (+91), for a
  combined wrapper change of 1600 -> 1807 (**+207**). The canonical engine grew by
  11 POSIX lines (`installer-engine.sh` 379 -> 390) for shell-literal quoting,
  snapshot-safe provenance/version overrides, and missing-payload tolerance, and
  by 11 PowerShell lines (`installer-engine.ps1` 462 -> 473) for the matching
  provenance/version override support plus the `$env:COMPUTERNAME` fallback
  above. Net result for this conversion leg: **229 lines added** to the combined
  agent-ssh + shared-engine corpus. Per the re-scoped Validation Plan below,
  that makes this a documented temporary growth leg, not a silent pass: the
  safety/provenance fixes earned their keep here, and the remaining adopter
  rollout must still offset this growth (or split out an explicit tightening
  follow-up) before the effort can close.

  - `python3 tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --check`
  - `python3 tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check`
  - `python3 tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py`

    -> PASS (`207 passed, 7 skipped`)
  - focused follow-up only on the changed installer regressions after the new
    snapshot tests exposed the missing self-contained `uv` source handling and
    the later review rounds identified quoting/snapshot-provenance regressions:
    `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-ssh --reinstall --admission-wait 540 -k "installer_fallback or install_manifest_source_path or install_snapshot"`
    -> PASS (`13 passed, 1 skipped, 207 deselected`), then after the final
    payload-copy / older-snapshot guards landed:
    `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-ssh --reinstall --admission-wait 540 -k "installer_fallback or install_snapshot"`
    -> PASS (`10 passed, 1 skipped, 210 deselected`)
  - focused PS/POSIX snapshot-only proof after the shared manifest-writer fix:
    `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-ssh --reinstall --admission-wait 540 -k install_snapshot`
    -> PASS (`13 passed, 214 deselected`)
  - final full suite after the review-fix pass:
    `test-supervisor --admission-timeout 120 --timeout 600 -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-ssh --reinstall --admission-wait 540`
    -> PASS (`220 passed, 7 skipped`)
  - real POSIX install proof: with `HOME` redirected into the session-state
    files area and `--install-dir <scoped root>`, the converted
    `plugins/agent-ssh/scripts/install.sh install` completed end-to-end,
    built the versioned runtime slot, imported `agent_ssh` successfully, wrote
    a deploy manifest with the correct local source metadata, and left **no**
    `plugins/agent-ssh/scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` copy in the `dev`
    checkout afterward.
- Validation not possible in this Linux/WSL session:
  - No real Windows `.ps1` install or native Windows PATH persistence lane on a
    Windows host. The PowerShell wrapper path was still exercised here through
    `pwsh`-driven snapshot/first-use tests plus a parse check, but that is not
    a substitute for a native Windows install.
- Test-hygiene note: no existing `agent-ssh` installer-adjacent test needed a
  containment rewrite this round, matching the 2026-10-05 hygiene sweep's
  spot-check. The new snapshot regressions were written to the same model as
  the sweep: isolated HOME/USERPROFILE/XDG/temp roots, stripped inherited
  Python env, and explicit subprocess timeouts. No fixture touched a real
  `~/.ssh` or real SSH key material; every provision/snapshot path ran entirely
  inside temp-rooted test homes.

### 2026-10-05 — `agent-bridge` adopted the shared installer engine

- Converted `plugins/agent-bridge/scripts/install.ps1` and
  `plugins/agent-bridge/scripts/install.sh` to the canonical-reference wrapper
  form: both now source
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` directly on `dev`, and
  `tools/installer_engine_ref.py` now registers `agent-bridge` as an adopter so
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` enforces that form.
- Removed the wrapper-local copies of the clearly shared helper bodies:
  PowerShell now uses shared `Invoke-NativeCapture`, `Test-IsSreModuleMismatch`,
  `Test-IsVenvCorruption`, `Invoke-UvVenvResilient`, `Ensure-Uv`,
  `New-SignedVenv`, and `Write-DeployManifest`; POSIX now uses shared
  `test_is_sre_module_mismatch`, `test_is_venv_corruption`,
  `invoke_uv_venv_resilient`, `ensure_uv`, and `write_deploy_manifest`.
  Genuinely bridge-specific logic stayed local: the build-artifact scrub
  wrapper around `uv pip install`, the bridge-specific uv bootstrap override
  path (`AGENT_BRIDGE_UV_BOOTSTRAP_*`), the large daemon lifecycle / draining /
  ZDD cutover flow, sibling-plugin installs, and the PowerShell stamped-snapshot
  materialization that now copies both the canonical installer-engine pair and
  the resolved vendored libs into the published snapshot before first-use
  provisioning can consume it.
- Installer-adjacent regression coverage now follows the same split as the
  other adopters: the generic retry/venv-corruption tests extract their bodies
  from `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{ps1,sh}`, while the
  bridge-specific build-artifact scrub tests keep exercising the local wrapper.
- **Line-count / corpus result:** wrapper-only installer lines shrank from
  `install.sh` 2392 -> 2204 (-188) and `install.ps1` 3211 -> 3139 (-72), for a
  combined wrapper drop of 5603 -> 5343 (**-260**). The canonical engine stayed
  flat at `installer-engine.sh` 403 lines and `installer-engine.ps1` 478 lines,
  so the combined agent-bridge + shared-engine corpus dropped from 6484 ->
  6224 (**-260**). This leg genuinely shrank the corpus; it did not merely move
  the same bytes elsewhere.
- Validation completed here:
  - `python3 tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --check`
