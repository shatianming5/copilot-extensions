# Vendor Pointer Generalization

- **Slug:** `vendor-pointer-generalization`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** independent per-phase worktrees
- **Created:** 2026-09-26
- **Status:** Done (archived 2026-10-02)
- **Vision:** none yet, deliberately — this effort does not introduce a new
  architectural direction; it extends `dev-branch-release-pipeline`'s own
  already-active, still-vision-less design (that umbrella effort's own
  header carries the identical "none yet" note for the same reason: the
  design itself predates any spawned vision doc). The governing pattern
  invariant this effort must keep satisfying is `docs/install-contract.md`'s
  self-contained-shipped-payload guarantee (see Context) — no new invariant
  is introduced, so no new pattern doc is required *before* Phase 1; Phase 3
  writes `docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md` to record the (unchanged)
  invariant plus the (new) pointer-kind mechanics once they exist.
- **Umbrella issue:** _TBD — file once this effort's plan clears review_
- **Sub-issues:** _TBD_
- **Mechanism status (2026-09-27, corrected AGAIN):** the "npm-workspace-style
  live reference" decision below was **superseded** the same day it was
  written (2026-09-26), by a **different, unrelated effort**
  (`agent-cli-lazy-dispatch`) that independently hit the same
  dev-time-resolver problem, drew a different conclusion from an
  incomplete trial, and shipped a working alternative
  (`VENDOR_POINTER.json` `kind=src-passthrough`) before this effort's own
  Phase 1 execution caught up to it. Phase 1 then formally adopted
  `src-passthrough` and converted 7 real libs with it: `lazy-cli-dispatch`
  (PR #3790, from the unrelated `agent-cli-lazy-dispatch` effort that
  originated the mechanism, adopted by this effort's own Phase 1 rather
  than reconverted) plus 6 more converted directly by this effort's own
  Phase 1 execution (PRs #3810, #3904, #3917, #3929, #3971, #4004) — see
  the 2026-09-26 "Course correction" Journal entry for that decision's
  own rationale.
  **That decision is now ALSO superseded.** A second, deeper empirical
  test (see the 2026-09-27 "Second course correction" Journal entry)
  found `src-passthrough` has a real STRUCTURAL weakness the first
  analysis under-weighted: it breaks on ANY non-editable install (even
  from a live dev checkout — confirmed 7 times over as issue #3905),
  because the generated stub FILE itself gets copied into
  `site-packages`, severing it from the monorepo root. The `uv`-editable
  form does NOT have this weakness — verified directly this time (not
  taken on the original agent's word): a dependency's own
  `editable = true` forces a live reference back to its canonical source
  **independent of the top-level package's own editable-ness**, so even a
  fully non-editable top-level install leaves the shared-lib dependency
  correctly resolving to canonical, un-copied. **Phase 1 is reverting
  course to the `uv`-editable / canonical-reference form** — the
  originally-decided mechanism, now properly re-validated rather than
  assumed broken. This requires: building the still-missing tooling (a
  TOML-aware drift guard, a promotion-time reference-rewriter, a
  conversion tool), and re-converting the 7 already-shipped
  `src-passthrough` libs to the new form. The file-pointer kind (docs) is
  unaffected either way. See the Journal for the full analysis and
  decision record.

## Guiding Intent

`vendored-doc-pointers` (Done, pending archive) proved the DRY vendor-pointer
pattern for one narrow surface (a single mirrored Markdown file): one
canonical source, a thin marker on `dev`, full expansion only in the
materialized `main` release the install-contract already requires to be
self-contained. This effort generalizes that same underlying promise —
"impossible to drift, by construction," replacing "copy + a script that
catches drift after the fact" — to every other construct in this repo that
is duplicated byte-for-byte across plugins at authoring time: real
shared-lib copies (`plugins/*/libs/*`, `worktree-manager/libs/*`) and,
if `vendored-installer-engine` adopts it, the shared installer-engine
surface.

**The concrete mechanism differs by construct** (see the header's
"Mechanism status" note; the design has now been resolved THREE times for
the libs surface — the original decision below, then the 2026-09-26
"Course correction" (to `src-passthrough`), then the 2026-09-27 "Second
course correction" (back to this design) — see both Journal entries for
the full history):

- **Libs**: the `uv [tool.uv.sources]` `path`+`editable = true` live
  reference, as originally decided (see the Design Decision section
  immediately below, no longer marked superseded) — no local directory
  of any kind in `dev`. **Not** `VENDOR_POINTER.json`
  `kind=src-passthrough` (the effort's second, now-also-superseded
  resolution — see the "Second course correction" Journal entry for why:
  `src-passthrough` breaks on any non-editable install, even from a live
  dev checkout, because the generated stub FILE itself is what gets
  copied into `site-packages`; the `uv`-editable form doesn't have this
  weakness, since a dependency's own `editable = true` forces a live
  canonical reference independent of the top-level package's own
  editable-ness). 7 real libs were converted to `src-passthrough` before
  this reversal and now need re-converting to this form.
- **The shared installer engine** (if `vendored-installer-engine` adopts
  this pattern): still an open question for that effort to resolve on its
  own terms; the live-reference idea sketched in the Design Decision below
  remains a candidate, but Phase 2 hasn't reached this yet.
- **Docs** (`vendored-doc-pointers`, already shipped): unchanged — a
  physical stub file (`kind=file`) expanded at promotion, same as always.

## Design decision — npm-workspace-style live reference over a `VENDOR_POINTER.json` stub (resolved 2026-09-26, superseded 2026-09-26, RE-ADOPTED 2026-09-27)

Operator directive, captured verbatim in a later Request round below:

This directly resolves Phase 1's originally-blocking "define the dev-time
resolver" item, and **supersedes the `VENDOR_POINTER.json` directory/lib
pointer kind for the libs surface specifically** (the design PR #3700-era
plan assumed before this directive landed). The file-pointer kind (docs)
is unaffected — a Markdown doc has no package-manager equivalent of a
live relative-path reference, so it still needs a physical (stub) file on
disk.

**The mechanism, validated with a real `uv` prototype (see Journal) before
committing to it:**

- **On `dev`, a consuming plugin's `pyproject.toml` references the
  canonical `libs/<lib>` directly**, via `[tool.uv.sources]`'s existing
  `path` key pointed *up* at the repo-root canonical location instead of a
  local vendored copy, with `editable = true` added:
  ```toml
  agent-ssh-manager = { path = "../../libs/ssh-manager", editable = true }
  ```
  (today's real entries read `{ path = "libs/ssh-manager" }`, resolving to
  a local vendored copy *inside* the plugin — this changes only the path
  target and adds `editable = true`, nothing else in the plugin's own
  `pyproject.toml` changes shape). **No local `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>`
  directory exists in `dev` at all** for a lib using this reference form —
  not a physical copy, not an empty stub, not a symlink. This is the exact
  npm-workspace analogue: "A and B's package.json reference C via relative
  path."
  - **Validated live-edit behavior**: `uv pip install -e .` against this
    config resolves `demo_lib.__file__` to the *canonical* source path
    (confirmed: editing the canonical file after install, with no
    reinstall, is picked up immediately on next import). This satisfies
    "run tests out of `dev`" and "call across folders in `dev`" exactly,
    for both `run-plugin-tests.py`'s editable install (Phase 1's original
    blocking problem — a pointer-only directory wasn't installable; this
    design has no local directory to install *from* at all, so the
    problem doesn't arise) and any static-analysis tool that resolves
    imports via the installed environment.
  - **`editable = true` is REQUIRED, not optional**: a plain `{ path =
    "../../libs/ssh-manager" }` (no `editable`) installs a frozen,
    non-live copy into site-packages even when the *top-level* package
    itself is installed with `-e` — confirmed by prototype. `editable`
    is set **per source entry**, independent of the top-level install
    mode.
  - **Also confirmed (important for the promotion-side fix below)**:
    `editable = true` on a source entry forces an editable install of
    *that* dependency even when the top-level package is installed
    **non-editable** (`uv pip install .`, no `-e`) — exactly how this
    repo's real end-user installers invoke it (`_uv_pip_install_resilient
    ... "$PLUGIN_DIR"`, confirmed no `-e` flag anywhere in
    `install.sh`). If promotion shipped a `main` payload that still
    carried the `../../libs/<lib>` + `editable = true` reference
    unchanged, a real end-user install would create an editable link
    pointing at a path that doesn't exist on their machine (they only
    receive `plugins/<plugin>/`, never the whole monorepo `libs/` tree) —
    an immediate `ImportError` in production. Promotion **must** rewrite
    the reference, not just copy content alongside it.
- **At promotion (`materialize_main.py`), for every `[tool.uv.sources]`
  entry whose `path` escapes the CONSUMING PROJECT's own root** (a
  plugin's `plugins/<plugin>/`, or `worktree-manager/` for that
  extra top-level consumer — not just "the plugin's own directory": a
  trigger scoped to plugins alone would skip `worktree-manager`'s own
  `../libs/<lib>` reference entirely, i.e. resolves outside that root, up
  toward the shared canonical root — reuse `_escapes_root()` from the
  existing containment work to detect this):
  1. Physically copy the canonical `libs/<lib>` directory's **complete
     tree** — `src/`, `README.md`, `tests/` (when the shipped payload is
     expected to carry one), AND `pyproject.toml` itself — into a
     freshly-created local `<consumer-root>/libs/<lib>/` (computed from
     the consuming project's own root — `plugins/<plugin>/` or
     `worktree-manager/`, not hardcoded to one layout). This must copy
     `pyproject.toml` explicitly, not merely "sync its version": the
     conversion step deletes the consumer's local `libs/<lib>/` directory
     entirely (no local directory of any kind remains in `dev`), so at
     promotion time there is no local `pyproject.toml` for a version-sync
     to update in the first place — the file has to be copied in from
     canonical before its version can be synced (or copied already
     carrying the right version, skipping a separate sync step).
  2. Rewrite the `pyproject.toml` line: `path` becomes the new local
     relative path (`libs/<lib>`), and `editable = true` is dropped —
     restoring exactly today's real shipped form (`{ path =
     "libs/ssh-manager" }`), a plain non-editable local-path dependency
     fully self-contained within the plugin's own shipped payload. A
     surgical regex rewrite (matching this repo's existing convention —
     see `_VERSION_RE.sub`'s version-string patch — not a full TOML
     parse/rewrite, to preserve every plugin's hand-authored comments
     documenting *why* each lib is vendored) is sufficient: the real
     format is consistently one `<dist-name> = { path = "..." }` line per
     dependency (confirmed by inspecting `agent-bridge`/`agent-worktrees`/
     `agent-mcp`'s real `[tool.uv.sources]` tables).
  3. The relative-path depth from a consuming `pyproject.toml` up to the
     canonical root differs by consumer location (`plugins/<plugin>/` is
     two levels down -> `../../libs/<lib>`; `worktree-manager/` is one
     level down -> `../libs/<lib>`) — the rewrite tool must compute this
     from the actual file location, not hardcode a depth.
- **The same pattern replaces Phase 2's planned executable pointer kind
  entirely** — no new pointer format is needed. A plugin's `install.sh`/
  `install.ps1` **directly `source`s/dot-sources the canonical
  `scripts/installer-engine.sh`/`.ps1` via a relative path** in `dev` (this
  needs no `uv`/Python mechanism at all — a shell `source`/PowerShell `.`
  with a relative path argument works natively, cross-platform, with no
  symlink and no new marker format). At promotion, `materialize_main.py`
  rewrites that `source`/`.` line to reference (or fully inlines) the
  freshly-copied-in local engine file, the same two-step copy-then-rewrite
  operation as the libs case above.

**Why not a filesystem symlink** (the more literal reading of "reference
via relative path," and how a real npm/yarn workspace actually implements
it under `node_modules/`)? Rejected: a symlink requires Windows Developer
Mode/admin and `git config core.symlinks=true` to survive a checkout
faithfully on this repo's own Windows CI/contributor matrix — the `uv`
`path`+`editable` mechanism achieves the identical live-reference behavior
with zero filesystem symlinks, fully portable, and needs no git/OS
configuration at all.

**Consequence for already-landed work (PR #3752):** the directory/lib
`VENDOR_POINTER.json` pointer kind's containment hardening
(`_resolve_within`, `_find_symlink`, `_escapes_root` on the *destination*
side) becomes dead code for the libs use case specifically — no real
plugin ever adopts it now. This is not wasted effort: `_escapes_root()` is
reused directly by this new mechanism's promotion-side containment check
above, and the file-pointer kind (docs) continues using
`_resolve_within()`/`_find_symlink()`-equivalent protections unchanged.
Phase 1's remaining plan below retires the directory-pointer *loop* in
`materialize()` (and its now-unexercised tests) rather than leave an
unused, security-hardened-for-nothing code path sitting in the tool
indefinitely — tracked as its own Plan item so the retirement is a
reviewed, deliberate removal (per this repo's subtractive-change
convention), not a silent deletion.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Driving agent | Designs and lands all phases | independent per-phase worktree |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** single driver, sequential phases (each phase's own worktree,
  its own PR, `pr-self-merge`).
- **Host (owns PRs):** the driving agent/machine.
- **Delegates:** none yet.
- **Handoff:** each phase closes with the relevant `tools/test_*.py` suite
  (and, once real plugins carry pointers, the full
  `python tools/run-plugin-tests.py` sweep for every touched plugin) green
  and its PR merged before the next phase's worktree opens.

## Context

Repo: `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions`.

- **`efforts/active/vendored-doc-pointers`** (Done, pending archive) — the
  effort this one continues in spirit. Landed the generalized single-file
  pointer marker (`<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=... kind=file -->`) and
  converted `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`'s three plugin
  mirrors to real pointers. Its own `materialize_main.py` docstring already
  frames this as "the whole-repo counterpart," anticipating exactly this
  generalization.
- **`efforts/active/dev-branch-release-pipeline`** (Active) — the umbrella
  that built the actual pointer machinery: `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py`
  (`--check` / `--restore-canonical` / `--materialize`, pointer-aware since
  its 2026-09-23 trial-port-back), `tools/materialize_main.py` (whole-repo
  pointer expansion, wired into the live `promote_release.py` pipeline —
  every real promotion already runs this), and `tools/preview_release.py`
  (the "preview-promo" script referenced in the Request — builds a scratch,
  fully-materialized local copy of one plugin for local-install testing,
  read-only against the real repo). Its Journal (2026-09-23, "Standalone
  DRY-pointer trial + port-back") documents the validated trial: all 56 real
  vendored-lib copies across 10 shared libs converted to
  `VENDOR_POINTER.json` stubs in an isolated clone, materialized back
  byte-for-byte identical, ~73% dev-tree size reduction for that surface —
  then explicitly deferred applying it to the real repo ("that conversion is
  deliberately left for Phase 2, not bundled into this tooling PR"). That
  deferred conversion never got picked up as a tracked Phase 2 item and is
  this effort's Phase 1.
- **`efforts/active/vendored-installer-engine`** (Active, Draft) — a
  parallel, independently-scoped effort collapsing every `agent-*` plugin's
  installer entrypoint (`install.ps1`/`.sh` or `init.ps1`/`.sh`) into a
  **shared engine** (`scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` — the byte-
  identical, non-varying mechanics) plus a **thin per-service
  wrapper/config** that stays genuinely per-plugin (launch command,
  capability flags, sibling installs — never collapsed; see that effort's
  own README, "Scale" and Phase 0/1 sections). Explicitly **decided
  against** a git-fetch bootstrap in favor of byte-vendoring the shared
  engine specifically (see its own "Design decision" Journal entries),
  citing the same install-contract constraint this effort's canonical-
  reference design (see Design Decision below) must also respect — but its
  chosen *mechanism* for keeping the engine's vendored copies in sync is
  `tools/sync-installer-engine.py --check` (a drift detector: copies can go
  stale until CI catches it), not a live reference (drift structurally
  impossible on `dev`). This effort's Phase 2 scopes the canonical-
  reference idea to that same shared-engine surface only — never the
  per-plugin wrapper/config, which must keep varying by plugin — and
  evaluates whether the engine, once it lands, should be re-expressed that
  way instead of byte-vendored; coordinate
  with that effort's own driver before changing its chosen mechanism out
  from under it, and do not silently fork its design.
- **`docs/install-contract.md`** — the governing constraint both this effort
  and `vendored-installer-engine` must keep satisfying: the *shipped*
  payload is completely self-contained, with nothing resolved from a
  sibling plugin or a git checkout at install/runtime. This effort's
  dev-time "call across folders" design is compatible with that constraint
  precisely because `dev` is never what ships — only `main`'s materialized
  output is, and materialization already fully inlines every pointer kind
  before a promotion commit is built.
- No `docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md` (or equivalent) exists yet describing
  the pointer kinds, their lifecycle, and which tool owns which invariant —
  this effort's Phase 3 should write it, consolidating what is currently
  only documented piecemeal across several tools' docstrings and two
  efforts' Journals.

(Verbatim operator instruction, given after landing `agent-worktrees:
hard-block @copilot mentions in GitHubProvider PR ops` (#3700) and its
forward note in `pull-request-capability` (#3718) — a detour from this
worktree's original effort, `vendored-doc-pointers`, discovered mid-flight
while finishing that effort's Phase 3.)

**Follow-up round, 2026-09-26** (after PR #3752 landed the containment/
fail-closed hardening, still blocked on the dev-time resolver decision):

See the 2026-09-27 "Second course correction" Journal entry for the
resolution now in effect: the Design Decision above IS the effort's
current, active plan again (after a temporary detour to `src-passthrough`,
documented in the 2026-09-26 "Course correction" entry — that detour is
itself now superseded, not the design above).

## Plan

### Phase 0 — Audit the real remaining surface (no code changes)
_(agent-recommended, mirroring `vendored-installer-engine`'s own Phase 0
shape before committing to a design)_
- [x] Enumerate every currently byte-duplicated-across-plugins construct in
      the repo (shared libs, installer engine, and any other "and more"
      candidates — e.g. shared CI guard scripts, shared skill fragments) and
      classify each as: already pointer-capable but unconverted (real libs),
      designed for byte-vendor+drift-checker today (installer engine), or
      not yet addressed by any mechanism. **Done, retroactively via the
      2026-09-30 "Phase 3 complete" Journal entry's bounded duplicate sweep**
      (hashed duplicate files across `plugins/*/`, enumerated remaining
      `VENDOR_POINTER.json` holdouts, checked existing duplicate-management
      tools) — the remaining large surfaces were found to already have
      explicit owners (`sync-installation-context.py`,
      `sync-versioned-runtime.py`/`check-runtime-resolution.py`,
      `check-bootstrap-sync.py`), not silent new candidates.
- [x] Confirm the existing `VENDOR_POINTER.json`/file-pointer forms are
      sufficient for the lib surface as-is, or whether real-world use
      surfaces a gap the isolated trial didn't (e.g. a lib with local,
      genuinely-per-plugin modifications layered on top of the canonical
      source — the trial's 56 copies were presumably byte-identical to
      canonical already; confirm that holds for every real copy before
      converting, since a pointer has no way to express a local diff).
      **Done:** every real copy converted across Phase 1 was confirmed
      byte-identical to canonical before conversion (per-lib Journal
      entries); no real per-plugin local source-tree diff was found
      anywhere (the pointer-vs-canonical-reference choice always turned
      on consumer mechanism, never on content divergence). The one
      remaining pointer-form user, `customizing-copilot`'s
      `plugin-activation` copy, is NOT a local-diff case either: it stays
      on the pointer form because it has no consuming `pyproject.toml` at
      all, and its own script reads the pointer's `source` field directly
      — a different, mechanism-level exception from the content-diff
      scenario this item was originally worried about (see the
      `src-passthrough` retirement note below).

### Phase 1 — Convert real shared-lib copies to canonical-reference form
- [x] **Define the dev-time resolver before converting anything** —
      **Resolved three times; the third resolution is current (2026-09-27,
      reverting to the first).** Originally resolved via the Design
      Decision above: `uv`'s `[tool.uv.sources]` `path` + `editable =
      true`. **Superseded 2026-09-26** by `VENDOR_POINTER.json`
      `kind=src-passthrough` (see the "Course correction" Journal entry)
      — 7 real libs were converted to it (PRs #3810, #3904, #3917, #3929,
      #3971, #4004) before a **second course correction (2026-09-27)**
      reverted back to the `uv`-editable form: a deeper, properly-verified
      test (not merely taken on faith this time) found `src-passthrough`
      has a real structural weakness the first analysis under-weighted —
      it breaks on ANY non-editable install, even from a live dev
      checkout, confirmed 7 times over as issue #3905, because the
      generated stub FILE is what gets copied into `site-packages`,
      severing it from the monorepo root. `uv`-editable does not share
      this weakness: a dependency's own `editable = true` forces a live
      canonical reference independent of the top-level package's own
      editable-ness, verified directly (see the "Second course
      correction" Journal entry for the exact reproduction). Every item
      below that was marked superseded in the second resolution is now
      un-struck and active again; the src-passthrough-specific notes are
      kept as historical record of what was tried and why it's being
      undone.
- [x] **Convert every real vendored lib to the canonical-reference form**:
      for every `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>` (and `worktree-manager/
      libs/<lib>`) copy that is byte-identical to its canonical
      `libs/<lib>` source, (1) delete the local copy entirely (no
      directory, no stub — nothing remains at that path in `dev`), (2)
      rewrite the consuming `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv.sources]` entry
      from `{ path = "libs/<lib>" }` to `{ path =
      "<relative-to-repo-root>/libs/<lib>", editable = true }` (the
      relative depth depends on the consumer's own location — two levels
      up from `plugins/<plugin>/`, one level up from `worktree-manager/`).
      Covers both trees (`sync-vendored-libs.py`/`check-vendored-libs-
      sync.py` already scan both today). **All sub-items below are
      complete for every ELIGIBLE copy; two copies are explicit,
      deliberate exceptions and do NOT take this canonical-reference
      form at all — see their own sub-item for why each:
      `customizing-copilot`'s `plugin-activation` copy (no consuming
      `pyproject.toml` at all, stays a pointer) and `agent-worktrees`'s
      `plugin-activation` copy (hits a real `uv` resolver conflict against
      its own deliberately-real `dropin-registry`/`plugin-resolve`
      siblings, resolved instead as a full real byte-vendored copy,
      2026-10-01).**
      - [x] **Re-convert the 7 libs already converted to `src-passthrough`**
            back to this form first, one at a time, using the exact same
            bounded-slice pattern already proven for the forward
            conversions (smallest blast radius first): `lazy-cli-dispatch`
            (1 consumer, `agent-worktrees`), `work-coalescing-singleton`
            (2: `agent-worktrees`, `worktree-manager`), `credential-relay`
            (4), `ssh-manager` (4), `single-instance-lease` (5),
            `config-migrate` (5) — **all 6 done**. `plugin-activation`'s
            re-conversion is **DONE for every consumer that can safely
            support the `uv`-editable form; its two remaining non-`uv`-
            editable copies are now resolved differently** — see the
            corrected sub-item immediately below. Each re-conversion
            closes out its own instance of issue #3905 (the non-editable-
            install gap no longer applies once that lib is back on the
            `uv`-editable form). `agent-worktrees`'s copy closed its own
            instance of issue #3905 too, via a full real vendored copy
            (issue #4788, 2026-10-01) rather than `uv`-editable — the gap
            no longer applies to it either, just by a different mechanism.
            Only `customizing-copilot`'s copy remains the current
            structural exception on `src-passthrough` and keeps issue
            #3905's gap open for it, pending the separate replacement
            described below.
            - [x] **Ordering caveat found during `ssh-manager`'s
                  conversion (2026-09-28)**: a lib with its OWN dependency
                  on another vendored lib (per its `pyproject.toml`
                  `dependencies`/`[tool.uv.sources]`) cannot be converted
                  ahead of that dependency for any consumer that ALSO
                  directly vendors the same dependency -- `uv` sees
                  conflicting resolutions (a local copy path vs.
                  canonical) for the same distribution name and refuses to
                  resolve. Check every remaining lib's own `pyproject.toml`
                  `dependencies` FIRST, before assuming this list's
                  original ordering is still safe as written; convert the
                  dependency early (bundled into the same PR, for the
                  affected consumers only) if it isn't already done. Any
                  canonical lib's OWN internal `[tool.uv.sources]` entry
                  for another vendored lib must ALSO carry
                  `editable = true` -- not just consumer-facing entries.
            - [x] **`plugin-activation`'s 8 consumers are now fully
                  classified: 6 `uv`-editable, 1 full real copy, 1
                  current structural exception on `src-passthrough`**
                  (superseding an earlier, inaccurate draft of this
                  sub-item — corrected 2026-09-29 after a reviewer finding
                  caught the drift): `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`,
                  `agent-bridge`, `agent-machines`, `agent-codespaces`, and
                  `worktree-manager` were converted to `uv`-editable in the
                  2026-09-28 bundled `dropin-registry`+`plugin-resolve`+
                  `plugin-activation` conversion. The remaining two copies
                  do **NOT** get the `uv`-editable form, for two entirely
                  different reasons:
                  - **`customizing-copilot`'s copy stays `src-passthrough`
                    for now, pending the separate replacement work the
                    retirement item below describes — not forever by
                    design.** This plugin has no `pyproject.toml`
                    consuming the lib via `[tool.uv.sources]` at all — the
                    `uv`-editable mechanism has no TOML entry to rewrite,
                    so it cannot structurally apply here regardless of any
                    other consideration. Its own
                    `skills/installing-plugins/scripts/plugin-activation.py`'s
                    `_resolve_state_py()` still reads the local
                    `VENDOR_POINTER.json`'s `source` field directly today
                    (confirmed live on 2026-09-29 — an intervening
                    Journal entry once claimed this was rewritten to a
                    direct canonical-path resolution and the pointer file
                    deleted, but that change never actually landed;
                    `_resolve_state_py()` and the `VENDOR_POINTER.json`
                    file are both still present and load-bearing).
                  - **`agent-worktrees`'s copy is the deliberate full-copy
                    exception.** The 2026-09-29 attempted `uv`-editable
                    re-conversion hit a real resolver conflict against its
                    deliberately-real local `dropin-registry`/
                    `plugin-resolve` siblings (PR #4447's build-surface
                    decision), and issue #4788 later proved that leaving
                    this one consumer on `src-passthrough` also breaks
                    staged non-editable installs. The explicit 2026-10-01
                    resolution is therefore a **real, byte-vendored local
                    copy** under `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/
                    plugin-activation/`, with `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`
                    enforcing that the real copy stays byte-identical to
                    canonical even though `customizing-copilot`'s remaining
                    peer is still only a pointer copy.
      - [x] Remaining real lib copies never yet converted at all
            (`session-liveness-probe`, `venue-copilot`) — convert directly
            to this form, skipping `src-passthrough` entirely.
            `session-liveness-probe`/`venue-copilot` initially had no top-level
            canonical `libs/<lib>/`; completed 2026-09-29 by promoting both to
            canonical first, then converting all 5 real consumers directly to
            `uv`-editable references (see the 2026-09-29 Journal entry below).
            `zdd` was finished later (2026-09-29) for every real consumer
            **except** deliberately-excluded `agent-worktrees`; see the
            Journal entry below for the rationale.
- [x] **Build the conversion tool**: a script performing the rewrite above
      across every real consumer of a given lib in one pass (a new tool,
      or a new mode on `sync-vendored-libs.py` — this repo currently has
      no "convert a real copy to a pointer/reference" tool FOR THIS FORM;
      `--pointerize` exists but only writes the `src-passthrough` form).
      Must refuse to convert a lib whose real copies have already drifted
      from canonical (reuse `_materialize_blocked()`'s existing drift
      check) — converting a drifted copy would silently discard whatever
      the copy had that canonical didn't. Must ALSO provide the reverse
      operation (re-convert an already-`src-passthrough` copy back to this
      form) for the 7-lib re-conversion above.
- [x] **Build the new drift/consistency guard for the reference form**:
      `check-vendored-libs-sync.py` has no concept of this reference form
      at all (it hashes whatever `src/` exists locally and compares copies
      against each other) — a `dev`-tree with no local copy shouldn't read
      as "missing"/"drifted." Extend it (or build a dedicated new guard)
      to recognize a `[tool.uv.sources]` entry whose `path` escapes the
      **consuming project's own root** (not just "the plugin's own
      directory" — Phase 1 explicitly includes `worktree-manager`
      consumers too, a top-level tree whose `../libs/<lib>` reference
      escapes `worktree-manager/` the same way a plugin's `../../libs
      /<lib>` escapes `plugins/<plugin>/`; a check scoped only to
      "plugin directory" would misreport a valid `worktree-manager`
      reference as missing/drifted) as a valid, intentional reference
      form, confirm `editable = true` is present (a forgotten `editable`
      would silently produce a frozen, non-live copy), and confirm the
      referenced canonical `libs/<lib>` actually exists.
- [x] **Extend `materialize_main.py`/`promote_release.py` for the
      reference-rewrite promotion step**: for every `[tool.uv.sources]`
      entry whose `path` escapes the **consuming project's own root**
      (same predicate as the drift guard above, not "the plugin's own
      directory" alone — a trigger condition scoped only to plugins would
      leave a `worktree-manager/pyproject.toml`'s `../libs/<lib>`
      reference untouched at promotion, shipping it with no materialized
      `worktree-manager/libs/<lib>` copy at all; reuse `_escapes_root()`
      from the existing containment work), copy
      canonical's **complete lib tree** — `src/`, `README.md`, `tests/`
      (when the shipped payload is expected to carry one), AND
      `pyproject.toml` itself — into a freshly-created local
      `<consumer-root>/libs/<lib>/`, so the materialized copy is a
      genuinely complete, byte-identical restoration of what a real
      vendored copy looks like today (the Validation Plan below requires
      a lossless round-trip; copying only `src/` + a version sync would
      silently drop `README.md`/`tests/` from every promoted payload,
      AND leave nothing to sync a version into in the first place — the
      conversion step deletes the consumer's local `libs/<lib>/`
      entirely, so no local `pyproject.toml` exists at promotion time
      until canonical's own is copied in). Compute the
      destination from the CONSUMING project's own root, not hardcoded to
      `plugins/<plugin>/`: Phase 1 explicitly includes `worktree-manager`
      consumers too (a top-level tree, not under `plugins/`), and a
      promotion step that only ever writes to `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>`
      would rewrite a converted `worktree-manager/pyproject.toml`'s
      reference without ever materializing the dependency under
      `worktree-manager/libs/<lib>`, shipping a broken package. Reuse
      `sync-vendored-libs.py`'s existing `_consumer_dir()`/
      `_EXTRA_CONSUMER_DIRS` resolution (already built for `--pointerize`,
      PR #3810) to compute the correct destination for either layout —
      then surgically rewrite the `pyproject.toml` line to the local,
      non-editable form (`{ path = "libs/<lib>" }`) — restoring exactly
      today's real shipped form. A surgical regex rewrite (matching this
      repo's existing convention — see `_VERSION_RE.sub`) is sufficient,
      to preserve every plugin's hand-authored comments. Reuse
      `promote_release.py`'s existing fail-closed-on-`SKIP` behavior (PR
      #3752) for an unresolvable reference. This is the step that makes
      the `uv`-editable form safe in production (a shipped `main` release
      never carries a live reference to a path that won't exist on the
      end-user's machine) — it does NOT yet exist, and blocks any real
      lib from safely completing this form's conversion until built.
- [x] **Retire the `src-passthrough` pointer kind.** Done, 2026-10-01
      (**PR #4805**): converted `customizing-copilot`'s last real
      `plugin-activation` holdout from a pointer copy to a full real
      vendored tree, simplified `installing-plugins/scripts/
      plugin-activation.py` to resolve that local `state.py` directly, and
      removed the retired kind's writer/materialize support from
      `sync-vendored-libs.py`, `materialize_main.py`, and
      `preview_release.py`. **Kept** `_resolve_within()`/
      `_escapes_root()`/`_find_symlink()` because the file-pointer kind
      still needs them, and the reference-rewrite step above still reuses
      `_escapes_root()` directly. The removal rationale is recorded in the
      Journal entry below, not only in the commit message.
- [x] Update `tools/preview_release.py` ("preview-promo") to perform the
      same copy-then-rewrite operation into its scratch preview copy
      (never the real tree) for a plugin using the reference form — its
      current `_materialize_into_preview()` only handles the
      `src-passthrough` form (built for that mechanism by PR #3803/
      #3810) and has no concept of the `uv`-editable reference form at
      all yet.
- [x] Confirm the live promotion pipeline (`promote_release.py` ->
      `materialize_main.py`) handles the converted real plugins correctly.
      **Done, 2026-10-01:** added
      `test_real_repo_uv_editable_materialization_matches_current_canonical_trees`,
      which walks every current `uv`-editable consumer reference in the real
      repo (65 consumer/lib pairs across 12 consumers), materializes it, and
      compares the output against a fresh current-canonical vendored
      reconstruction (copy canonical -> materialize nested refs) rather than a
      stale historical tree. No `SKIP`s, no tree drift.
- [x] Confirm every consuming plugin's own test suite
      (`tools/run-plugin-tests.py <plugin>`) passes with **no local
      `libs/<lib>` directory present at all** in the `dev` checkout —
      proving the canonical reference alone (via `[tool.uv.sources]`
      `path` + `editable = true`) is sufficient for `uv pip install -e .`
      and subsequent test/static-analysis resolution. Additionally
      confirm (this is the whole point of the second course correction) a
      NON-editable `uv pip install <plugin-dir>` still resolves the
      shared-lib dependency to canonical live (not copied) — the property
      `src-passthrough` lacked. **Status, 2026-10-01:** the editable
      half is DONE — the full-suite proof covers every converted plugin
      consumer (`tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees --reinstall`
      plus the earlier 11-plugin sweep recorded below). The non-editable
      half's two real blocking bugs are now fixed (`agent-worktrees`'s
      packaged wrapper assets, issue #4787; its staged-install source
      recovery, issue #4788 — both merged, PRs #4796/#4794), **but the
      non-editable suite proof itself is still open**: it is only
      directly confirmed so far for `agent-worktrees`, `agent-vault`, and
      `agent-ssh` (3 of the 11 real converted plugin consumers above —
      `lazy-cli-dispatch` is a lib `agent-worktrees` consumes, PR #4245,
      not a distinct plugin, so it does not add a fourth). **Done,
      2026-10-02:** finished the remaining 8-plugin non-editable sweep in
      scratch venvs installed with `uv pip install <plugin-dir>` (no `-e`)
      from the live checkout, then ran each plugin's own suite through
      `test-supervisor`, confirming every escaping `editable = true`
      `[tool.uv.sources]` dependency still imported from canonical
      `libs/*/src`. Newly confirmed this session: `agent-bridge`
      (2969 passed / 25 skipped), `agent-mcp` (625 / 9), `agent-containers`
      (560 / 4), `agent-codespaces` (1579 / 13), `agent-dispatch`
      (3756 / 11), `agent-logger` (664 / 37), `agent-index` (714 / 3),
      and `agent-machines` (690 / 16). Two real non-editable source-root
      bugs surfaced and were fixed in the same sweep — `agent-containers`
      and `agent-codespaces` now recover their payload-local shim roots from
      `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT`, deploy-manifest source metadata, or PEP 610
      `direct_url.json` when the top-level plugin itself is installed
      non-editably — and one test-only source-root assumption in
      `agent-dispatch` was corrected so its build-info stamper test resolves
      `scripts/stamp_build_info.py` from the live source checkout instead of
      assuming the installed package sits beside `scripts/`. With those
      fixes, the full 11-plugin set is now directly confirmed:
      `agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-mcp`,
      `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-vault`,
      `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-index`, and
      `agent-machines`.

### Phase 2 — Canonical-reference form for the shared installer engine
> **Status note (2026-09-30, updated):** libs' mechanism pivoted away to
> `src-passthrough` on 2026-09-26, then reverted back to `uv`-editable on
> 2026-09-27 (see both "course correction" Journal entries) — Phase 2's

> is therefore valid again. That evaluation has now been formally executed

> remaining.
- [x] **Scope correction (from review, still holds): this applies only to
      `vendored-installer-engine`'s shared engine files**
      (`scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}`), never to a whole plugin's
      `install.sh`/`install.ps1`/`init.*` entrypoint — that entrypoint stays
      a per-service wrapper/config (launch command, capability flags,
      sibling installs) that must keep varying by plugin, per that effort's
      own design.
- [x] **No new pointer kind needed** — the live-reference idea (a plugin's
      `install.sh`/`install.ps1` directly `source`s/dot-sources the
      canonical `scripts/installer-engine.sh`/`.ps1` via a relative path
      in `dev`) matches libs' own current mechanism again as of the second
      course correction above. Left `[x]` for the underlying dot-source-
      preservation ANALYSIS (still holds regardless of which pointer
      mechanism is in play) — and that premise is now concretely exercised
      by the proof-adopter execution recorded below, not an unexecuted
      caution against treating Phase 2 as already demonstrated.
- [x] At promotion, `materialize_main.py` (extended the same way as the
      libs case) rewrites that `source`/`.` line to reference (or fully
      inline) a freshly-copied-in local `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}`
      copy — the same copy-then-rewrite operation as Phase 1's libs
      conversion, reusing `_escapes_root()` for containment and
      `promote_release.py`'s existing fail-closed-on-`SKIP` behavior.
      Regression coverage for a missing/escaping engine reference in both
      materializers (real + preview).
- [x] Extend `tools/preview_release.py` to perform the same copy-then-
      rewrite for a plugin referencing the engine canonically.
- [x] Coordinate with `vendored-installer-engine`'s own driver/Journal
      before adopting this for its canonical engine, once that engine
      exists to reference — this effort does not fork that effort's design
      or timeline; it only proposes a simpler mechanism than that effort's
      current `sync-installer-engine.py --check` byte-vendor-and-verify
      approach, for that effort's own driver to evaluate and decide
      whether/when to adopt. **Resolved for the `agent-pull-requests`
      proof point by an explicit operator-approved cross-effort decision in
      the driving session, then recorded in both efforts' Journals.**
- [x] If adopted, resolve `tools/check-install-contract.py`'s existing call
      into `sync-installer-engine.py`'s `verify()` (which currently
      byte-compares every adopter) so it recognizes the canonical-reference
      form as in-sync rather than rejecting every converted adopter.

### Phase 3 — Document the pattern; sweep for further "and more" candidates
- [x] Write `docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md`: the file-pointer kind (docs,
      unchanged) and the `uv`-editable canonical-reference form (libs,
      and the shared installer engine if Phase 2 lands — see both
      Course-correction Journal entries for the mechanism's full history;
      `src-passthrough` was a temporary detour, now being reverted, and
      must NOT be what this doc describes) — their lifecycle (a live
      relative-path reference in `dev`, -> `materialize_main.py`
      copy-and-rewrite at promotion -> shipped `main` content), which
      tool owns which invariant, and how a new plugin/lib/script opts in.
- [x] Revisit whether any other currently-duplicated construct surfaced in
      Phase 0's audit ("and more") warrants conversion in this effort or a
      follow-on; file a tracked issue for anything deferred rather than
      dropping it silently.

## Validation Plan

> **Note (2026-09-27):** this section documents validation criteria that
> have flipped TWICE now (uv-editable -> src-passthrough -> uv-editable
> again — see the Journal's two course-correction entries). Items below
> reflect the CURRENT (uv-editable) criteria; where a src-passthrough-era
> criterion was substituted in, that's flagged and reverted, not silently
> replaced again, so a future reader can see the full history.

- [x] Every real lib copy converted in Phase 1 — every
      `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>` copy **and every `worktree-manager/
      libs/*` copy** — round-trips losslessly. The *faithful* real-repo
      baseline is **not** a raw historical pre-conversion tree when the
      conversion PR also changed canonical README/tests content in the same
      commit; instead compare `materialize_main.py`'s current promotion output
      against a fresh reconstruction of "what this copy would look like if it
      were byte-vendored from the SAME current canonical source" (copy
      canonical -> materialize nested refs), which is the real-repo equivalent
      of the isolated trial's byte-diff proof. **Done, 2026-10-01:** the new
      durable regression `test_real_repo_uv_editable_materialization_matches_
      current_canonical_trees` runs that check for every live
      `uv`-editable consumer reference in the repo: **65 consumer/lib pairs
      across 12 consumers**, all byte-identical with zero `SKIP`s.
- [x] A converted plugin's own test suite (`tools/run-plugin-tests.py
      <plugin>`) passes with **no local `libs/<lib>` directory present at
      all** in the `dev` checkout — proving the canonical reference alone
      (via `[tool.uv.sources]` `path` + `editable = true`) is sufficient
      for `uv pip install -e .` and subsequent test/static-analysis
      resolution, matching the Design Decision's validated prototype.
      **Done, 2026-10-01:** bounded `run-plugin-tests.py --reinstall`
      batches passed for every converted plugin suite:
      `agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-containers`,
      `agent-codespaces`, `agent-vault`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`,
      `agent-ssh`, `agent-index`, and `agent-machines`.
      (Briefly marked superseded during the `src-passthrough` era, since
      that form keeps a local pointer directory — reverted now that
      `uv`-editable is current again; a `src-passthrough` copy's own
      "local pointer directory present, `src/` replaced by a stub"
      criterion no longer applies once each lib is re-converted.)
- [x] **NEW criterion, added by the second course correction**
      (confirmed for `lazy-cli-dispatch` specifically, PR #4245 -- not
      yet for every lib, since only that one is converted so far): a
      converted plugin's own test suite ALSO passes when the plugin
      itself (not just the dependency) is installed **non-editably**
      (`uv pip install <plugin-dir>`, no `-e`) from a live `dev` checkout
      — the shared-lib dependency must still resolve live to canonical
      (confirmed via a direct scratch-dir reproduction during the second
      course correction: `agent_procutil.__file__` resolved to canonical
      even with the top-level package installed non-editably, because
      `editable = true` on the dependency's own `[tool.uv.sources]` entry
      is independent of the top-level's install mode). This is the
      property `src-passthrough` structurally lacked (issue #3905); it is
      the primary reason for reverting to this mechanism, so it must be
      demonstrated directly, not merely inferred from the earlier
      editable-install prototype. **Status, 2026-10-01:** was OPEN earlier
      the same day. Local scratch validation did get `agent-worktrees` green
      non-editably after fixing missing payload-root assets and iterating on
      the remaining `plugin-activation` passthrough fallback, but PR #4767
      review found the then-current approach not yet safely shippable:
      packaged payload fallback still depended on external
      `worktree-manager/bin/*` wrapper assets, and the PEP 610
      `direct_url.json` source-recovery path could still point at a
      transient installer staging directory rather than a durable checkout.
      Those two blockers were tracked explicitly as issue **#4787**
      (wrapper assets not self-contained in packaged fallback) and issue
      **#4788** (staged non-editable installs lose the remaining
      `src-passthrough` source binding). **Update, 2026-10-01 later:** both
      underlying bugs resolved. #4788 closed by converting
      `agent-worktrees`'s `plugin-activation` copy to a full real vendored
      tree with committed staged-install regression coverage (PR #4794).
      #4787 closed by packaging `agent-worktrees`'s launch-wrapper assets
      into the plugin's own payload via a manifest-driven materialize step
      (`tools/materialize_launch_wrapper_assets.py`), with a packaged-preview
      regression proving `deploy_wrappers()` succeeds from a payload-only
      root with no sibling `worktree-manager/` present (PR #4796). With both
      bugs fixed, `agent-worktrees` itself is now confirmed non-editably,
      alongside `agent-vault` and `agent-ssh` (3 of 11 real converted
      plugin consumers — `lazy-cli-dispatch` is a lib `agent-worktrees`
      consumes, PR #4245, not a distinct fourth). **Done, 2026-10-02:**
      closed the remaining 8-plugin gap with the same scratch-venv proof:
      `agent-bridge`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`,
      `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`, `agent-index`, and
      `agent-machines` were each installed non-editably from the live
      checkout, their full suites passed under `test-supervisor`, and their
      `editable = true` canonical-reference lib dependencies imported live
      from canonical `libs/*/src` rather than a copied vendored tree.
- [x] Editing the canonical `libs/<lib>` source and re-running a
      converted plugin's tests **without reinstalling** picks up the edit
      — the "in-place test scripts in `dev`" / "call across folders"
      requirement, demonstrated against a real plugin (not just the
      isolated prototype). **Done, 2026-10-01:** a targeted
      `pytest` proof against `agent-ssh`'s real test venv showed
      `venue_copilot.MAX_SEED_CHARS` change `24000 -> 24001` taking
      effect immediately without any reinstall, then reverting cleanly.
- [x] `tools/preview_release.py` ("preview-promo") correctly performs the
      copy-then-rewrite for a plugin using the canonical-reference form
      when building a scratch local-install preview. **Done, PR #4245** --
      confirmed end-to-end against `lazy-cli-dispatch` (not mocked).
- [x] `materialize_main.py`'s directory-pointer path refuses a `source`
      that escapes `canonical_root` (the same containment guarantee the
      file-pointer path already has via `_resolve_within()`). **Done, PR
      #3752** — also extended to reject a symlink inside/as the canonical
      `src/` tree and a destination pointer path escaping `dest`.
      (Briefly described as "the permanent, active mechanism, not slated
      for retirement" during the `src-passthrough` era — reverted: this
      directory-pointer path IS slated for retirement again, once all 7
      libs are re-converted back to the `uv`-editable form and no
      consumer uses `src-passthrough` anymore. `_escapes_root()` itself
      is reused directly by the reference-rewrite containment check
      below and by the file-pointer kind, so it is never removed.)
- [x] The reference-rewrite promotion step's OWN containment check —
      **done, PR #4245**: `materialize_main.py`'s
      `materialize_uv_editable_ref_into()` refuses a `[tool.uv.sources]`
      `path` that escapes `canonical_root`, the same way the (soon-to-be-
      retired) directory-pointer path above already does (its own
      `_escapes_root()` copy, mirroring rather than importing across the
      hyphenated/non-hyphenated filename boundary).
- [x] A promotion run against a deliberately malformed/unresolvable pointer
      aborts the promotion rather than producing a `main` snapshot
      containing an unexpanded stub. **Done, PR #3752** — covered for a
      missing `source` at the promotion level
      (`test_promote_refuses_when_a_pointer_does_not_resolve`); extend the
      same fail-closed behavior to cover an unresolvable canonical
      reference (missing/escaping lib) once Phase 1's rewrite step lands.
      **Extended, 2026-10-01:** `test_promote_refuses_when_a_uv_editable_
      reference_does_not_resolve` now proves the same promotion-level
      fail-closed behavior for a missing canonical lib reference.
- [x] If Phase 2 lands: a canonically-referenced `scripts/installer-
      engine.{sh,ps1}` runs correctly **in dev**, unmaterialized,
      dot-sourced (`source` on POSIX, `.` on PowerShell — not merely
      executed as a child process) by a plugin's own wrapper across
      folders into the canonical engine, on both platforms — demonstrating
      the "in-place test scripts in `dev`" requirement without requiring
      `preview_release.py`/materialization first. **Done, 2026-10-01:**
      `bash plugins/agent-pull-requests/scripts/install.sh status`
      succeeded directly from `dev`, and a direct PowerShell dot-source of
      the exact canonical `installer-engine.ps1` path loaded
      `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` successfully under `pwsh`.
- [x] A materialized `main` build of the same plugin is fully self-contained
      — no cross-folder reference remains in the shipped payload, and no
      `editable = true` reaches a real shipped install — per
      `docs/install-contract.md`. **Done, 2026-10-01:** preview builds for
      `agent-pull-requests` and `agent-codespaces` rewrote the payload to
      plugin-local `scripts/installer-engine.*` / `libs/*` paths; no
      `../../libs/...` references or live `editable = true` entries remain
      in their shipped `pyproject.toml` / installer source lines.
- [x] No existing plugin's test suite or live installer regresses from the
      Phase 1 lib-conversion. **Done, 2026-10-01:** the full converted-
      plugin suite sweep above passed green, covering every plugin with
      uv-editable Phase-1 lib consumers.

_Pending._

## Journal

### 2026-09-26 — Kickoff
- Effort created from an explicit operator request to broaden
  `vendored-doc-pointers` beyond docs, discovered as a detour while
  finalizing an unrelated `@copilot`-mention-guard hardening pass. Captured
  the request verbatim in Request; the Guiding Intent, Context, and Plan
  above summarize/organize the existing, already-substantial groundwork
  (`dev-branch-release-pipeline`'s pointer machinery, the isolated 56-copy
  trial, `vendored-installer-engine`'s parallel, differently-mechanized
  effort) rather than starting from a blank page — most of what this effort
  needs already exists; it was built, validated, and then not applied to
  the real repo (libs) or not yet designed for at all (executable
  scripts).
- Not started: no implementation yet. Next session should begin Phase 0, or
  if that's already implicitly proven, Phase 1's now-first item: define the
  dev-time resolver (test-runner installability of a pointer-only
  directory) before converting a single real lib copy.
- **Round 1 review (2026-09-26):** four findings, all addressed before
  merge: (1) Phase 1 didn't account for `tools/run-plugin-tests.py`
  installing lib copies as real `uv` path packages — a bare
  `VENDOR_POINTER.json` directory isn't installable; added a blocking
  "define the dev-time resolver first" item. (2) `check-vendored-libs-
  sync.py` was wrongly assumed pointer-aware (only `sync-vendored-libs.py`
  is, a separate tool) — corrected, and added a Phase 1 item to extend it
  with real schema/canonical-target validation. (3) Vision left unset with
  a deferred rationale — firmed up: this effort deliberately carries no new
  vision because it extends `dev-branch-release-pipeline`'s existing
  design under the same already-governing `install-contract.md` invariant,
  not a new architectural direction. (4) Guiding Intent's "no real plugin
  carries a pointer yet" wrongly read as covering all pointer kinds —
  qualified to the directory/lib kind specifically (three real files
  already carry `kind=file` pointers).
- **Round 2 review (2026-09-26):** two more findings, both confirmed
  against the real code and fixed: (1) `materialize_main.py`'s directory-
  pointer path resolves `canonical_root / source_rel` with no containment
  check, unlike the file-pointer path's `_resolve_within()` — a committed
  `../`-escaping `source` could make promotion copy an arbitrary path into
  the release snapshot. Added a Phase 1 item to fix `materialize()` before
  any real conversion. (2) `preview_release.py`'s
  `_materialize_into_preview()` calls `_materialize_blocked()`, which
  treats a pointer-only lib copy as content drift and blocks it today — a
  pointerized lib cannot yet produce a scratch preview. Added a Phase 1
  item to fix this directly (moved out of the Validation Plan, where it
  was only an assumption).
- **Round 3 review (2026-09-26):** two more findings on Phase 2's design
  completeness, both fixed: (1) `preview_release.py`'s scratch build has no
  materialization path for the (not-yet-designed) executable pointer kind
  — added an explicit Phase 2 item alongside the `materialize_main.py` one.
  (2) The drift/consistency-checking item wrongly assigned executable-
  pointer checking to the lib-scoped `sync-vendored-libs.py`, conflating it
  with the installer-engine surface's own `sync-installer-engine.py` —
  corrected to assign it to a new generic pointer validator or
  `sync-installer-engine.py` itself, never the lib tool.
- **Round 4 review (2026-09-26):** two more findings, both confirmed and
  fixed: (1) `promote_release.consume_pending_changes()` captures
  `materialize()`'s log but never inspects it for a `SKIP`/failure marker —
  a malformed or containment-rejected pointer would currently ride straight
  through into the shipped `main` snapshot as an unexpanded stub instead of
  blocking promotion. Added a Phase 1 item requiring promotion to fail
  closed on any unresolved pointer, plus a matching Validation Plan item.
  (2) Phase 2's scope was too broad: `vendored-installer-engine`'s own
  design keeps each plugin's `install.sh`/`install.ps1`/`init.*` as a
  per-service wrapper/config, with only `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}`
  as the byte-identical shared surface — pointerizing a whole entrypoint
  would discard per-plugin arguments and lifecycle behavior. Corrected the
  Phase 2 heading, design item, Context's description of that effort, and
  the Validation Plan's install-script item to scope the new pointer kind
  to the shared engine file only.
- **Round 5 review (2026-09-26):** one new finding, one previously-missed
  finding, both fixed: (1) the executable-pointer design didn't account for
  the existing installer wrappers **dot-sourcing** `scripts/installer-
  engine.*` (POSIX `source`, PowerShell `.`) so its functions land in the
  caller's own scope — a stub that just executes the engine as a child
  process can't provide that. Added an explicit dot-source-preservation
  requirement to the Phase 2 design item and a matching Validation Plan
  item testing both platforms. (2) Round-1's fix wrongly described the
  test runner's install command as `uv sync`; corrected throughout to the
  actual editable `uv pip install -e`.
- **Round 6 review (2026-09-26):** three more findings, all confirmed and
  fixed: (1) the executable pointer kind needed the same root-containment
  guarantee just added for directory pointers — added to the
  `materialize_main.py` item, with regression coverage required in both
  materializers. (2) Phase 1's real-conversion scope missed
  `worktree-manager/libs/*`, a tree both `sync-vendored-libs.py` and
  `check-vendored-libs-sync.py` already scan alongside `plugins/*/libs/*` —
  added explicit coverage (or an explicit exclusion decision) to that Plan
  item. (3) `check-install-contract.py`'s existing guard calls
  `sync-installer-engine.py`'s `verify()` directly, which byte-compares
  every adopter — a pointerized engine copy would fail that check even
  after a new pointer validator exists. Added a Phase 2 item to update or
  replace that call path.
- **Round 7 review (2026-09-26):** one small follow-on finding — the
  round-trip Validation Plan item only named `plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>`
  even though round 6 had already extended Phase 1's conversion scope to
  `worktree-manager/libs/*`. Fixed to cover both. **Concluding active
  review engagement here**: seven rounds have progressively narrowed from
  blocking design gaps (installability, containment, fail-closed
  promotion) to this kind of small cross-reference-consistency nit,
  consistent with CONTRIBUTING.md's own guidance against chasing a
  zero-finding pass that may never come. Merging once CI is green;
  further findings on execution (not on this plan document) belong in the
  phase PRs that actually implement it.

### 2026-09-26 — Phase 1 execution begins: safety-hardening slice landed (PR #3752)
- Started executing Phase 1. Rather than attempt the whole phase (dev-time
  resolver decision + bulk conversion + tooling extension) in one PR, split
  off the three findings that were already fully specified and independent
  of the still-undecided resolver design: directory-pointer containment,
  `worktree-manager/libs/*` tooling coverage, and promotion fail-closed
  behavior. Landed as `tools/materialize_main.py` + `tools/promote_release.py`
  changes, PR #3752, after 3 review rounds that found real, deeper gaps
  than the plan's own text anticipated:
  - Round 1: the containment fix itself (route directory pointers through
    `_resolve_within()`, extend `find_pointers()`).
  - Round 2 finding: `shutil.copytree` follows symlinks by default, so a
    canonical lib's `src/` containing (or itself being) a symlink would
    leak external content past the new containment check. Added
    `_find_symlink()`, refusing any symlink in a canonical lib source
    outright.
  - Round 3 findings (two): (a) `find_pointers()` follows a symlinked
    plugin/libs directory when globbing under `dest`, so a pointer whose
    own containing directory resolves outside `dest` would still be
    "found" and written to. Added `_escapes_root()` (shared with
    `_resolve_within()`) as a destination-side containment check. (b)
    `build()`'s initial whole-repo snapshot copy used
    `shutil.copytree(symlinks=False)`, dereferencing any symlink anywhere
    in the source tree *before* `materialize()`'s own checks ever ran —
    fixed by passing `symlinks=True` (confirmed safe: no tracked symlink
    exists in this repo today, via `git ls-files -s`).
  - 10 new test functions in the final diff (9 in
    `test_materialize_main.py`, 1 in `test_promote_release.py` — corrected
    in review from an earlier miscounted 21, which summed tests added
    across incremental review-round commits rather than the final diff).
    Merged after CI green
    and merge state clean (a possible 4th review round was not observed
    within a reasonable wait after the 3rd fix; CI and merge-state were
    both clean, and this repo's review is advisory/non-blocking).
- Marked the containment, worktree-manager-tooling, and fail-closed Plan
  items `[x]` above; the Validation Plan's two matching items likewise.
- **Not yet done, still blocking the bulk conversion**: the dev-time
  resolver design decision (Plan's first Phase 1 item — how
  `run-plugin-tests.py`'s editable `uv pip install -e` handles a
  pointer-only lib directory), the `check-vendored-libs-sync.py` pointer-
  schema/canonical-target validation, the `preview_release.py` pointer-
  materialization fix, and the actual conversion of every real
  `plugins/*/libs/*` + `worktree-manager/libs/*` copy. Next session should
  pick up the dev-time resolver decision next, since the bulk conversion
  item is explicitly gated on it.

### 2026-09-26 — Resolver decision: canonical-reference form supersedes the directory pointer kind
- Operator gave the mission directly: model the dev-time resolver on npm
  workspaces (relative-path reference in dev, real vendoring only at
  publish/promotion time), captured verbatim in Request above.
- Validated feasibility with a standalone `uv` prototype
  (`/tmp/uv-workspace-proto`, not committed) before writing anything into
  this repo: a consuming package's `[tool.uv.sources]` entry pointing at a
  sibling-of-root canonical package via a relative path, with `editable =
  true`. Confirmed: (1) `demo_lib.__file__` resolves directly to the
  canonical source, not a copy; (2) editing canonical after install (no
  reinstall) is picked up immediately on next import; (3) `editable = true`
  is required per-entry — a plain `path` reference installs a frozen copy
  even when the top-level package is itself `-e`; (4) `editable = true`
  forces an editable install of *that* dependency even when the top-level
  install is non-editable (`uv pip install .`, no `-e`) — confirmed this is
  exactly how this repo's real `install.sh` invokes it for real end-user
  installs, which means promotion **must** rewrite the reference (drop
  `editable`, repoint at a newly-local copy) rather than just copy content
  alongside an unchanged reference, or a real production install would
  try to resolve a path that doesn't exist on the end-user's machine.
- Wrote up the full design as a new "Design Decision" section (this
  README, above Participants) and revised Phase 1/2/3 and the Validation
  Plan to match: the canonical-reference form (relative `path` +
  `editable = true`, no local directory of any kind in `dev`) replaces
  both the directory/lib `VENDOR_POINTER.json` pointer kind (libs) and the
  need for any new "executable pointer kind" at all (installer engine —
  a plugin's wrapper just dot-sources the canonical engine directly via a
  relative path in `dev`; no new marker format needed). The file-pointer
  kind (docs) is unaffected — a Markdown doc has no package-manager
  equivalent of a live reference.
- Explicitly decided **not** to use a filesystem symlink (the more literal
  reading of "reference via relative path," and how a real npm/yarn
  workspace implements it under `node_modules/`) — it would require
  Windows Developer Mode/admin and `git config core.symlinks=true` to
  survive a checkout faithfully on this repo's own Windows CI/contributor
  matrix. The `uv` `path`+`editable` mechanism gets the identical live-
  reference behavior with zero filesystem symlinks and no git/OS
  configuration.
- Marked Phase 1's "define the dev-time resolver" and Phase 2's two scope/
  design items `[x]` (resolved by this decision); added a new,
  deliberate-not-silent Phase 1 item to retire the now-superseded
  directory-pointer loop and its now-unexercised tests from PR #3752 (kept
  the shared `_resolve_within()`/`_escapes_root()`/`_find_symlink()`
  helpers, since the file-pointer kind and the new reference-rewrite step
  both still need them).
- **Not yet done**: the actual conversion tool (no "convert a real copy to
  a reference" tool exists yet — confirmed while writing this), the new
  drift/consistency guard recognizing the reference form, the
  `materialize_main.py`/`promote_release.py` copy-then-rewrite extension,
  the `preview_release.py` equivalent, the directory-pointer retirement
  itself, and the actual bulk conversion. Next session should start with
  the conversion tool + the materialize/promote extension together (they
  share the rewrite logic), proven against exactly one real plugin/lib
  before converting the rest, per this effort's own established pattern
  of landing one bounded, testable slice at a time.

### 2026-09-26 — Course correction: `src-passthrough` formally adopted, superseding the resolver decision above

- **How this was caught**: after driving PR #3810 (this effort's own
  Phase 1 execution — converting `work-coalescing-singleton` — through 23
  automated review rounds and merging it) and going to update this
  README's Plan/Journal to reflect that merge, the merged PR turned out to
  use `VENDOR_POINTER.json` `kind=src-passthrough` (a real local stub
  directory) — the *opposite* of the "Resolver decision" entry directly
  above, which explicitly retires the directory/lib pointer kind in favor
  of a `uv [tool.uv.sources]` `path`+`editable` live reference with NO
  local directory at all. This effort's own README had never been updated
  to record the pivot; it was flagged to the operator as a genuine
  design-crossroads blocker rather than silently reconciled either way.
- **Root cause traced**: `src-passthrough` was invented by a *different*,
  unrelated effort — `agent-cli-lazy-dispatch` (PR #3790, commit
  `106bc125c`) — which independently hit the same "how does a lib under
  active dev-time development resolve without a real local copy" problem
  a bit later the same day, and drew a different conclusion: its own
  commit message states a "scratch trial converting agent-worktrees' own
  agent-procutil copy to a bare pointer and running its real `uv pip
  install -e .` failed outright -- `does not appear to be a Python
  project`." That trial converted the LOCAL pointer directory to a bare
  marker with no `src/`, while leaving `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[tool.uv.sources]` entry **unchanged** — still pointing at that
  now-empty local directory, never rewritten to reference canonical
  directly. That is a different (and incomplete) thing than this effort's
  actual "Resolver decision": rewrite the reference itself to point
  straight at canonical, with no local directory of any kind, not even an
  empty marker.
- **Empirically re-tested the ACTUAL documented mechanism** (not the
  incomplete variant `agent-cli-lazy-dispatch` tried) in an isolated
  scratch copy (`/tmp/uv-editable-trial`, not committed): copied a real
  consumer (`plugins/agent-mcp`) plus its 4 canonical libs, deleted the
  consumer's local `libs/` copies entirely, rewrote `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[tool.uv.sources]` entries to `{ path = "../../libs/<lib>", editable =
  true }` pointing directly at canonical, then ran the EXACT command
  `tools/run-plugin-tests.py` uses (`uv pip install --python <py> -e
  <spec>`). **Result: it works.** Install succeeded, `agent_procutil
  .__file__` resolved directly to the canonical path (no local copy
  anywhere), editing canonical was picked up on the next import with no
  reinstall, and 414 of agent-mcp's real tests passed (all 195 failures
  were an unrelated missing `pytest-asyncio` in the minimal scratch venv,
  confirmed by inspecting one failure's traceback — nothing to do with
  the reference mechanism). This confirms the original "Resolver decision"
  above was sound and would have worked; `agent-cli-lazy-dispatch`'s
  rejection was based on an incomplete trial, not a real flaw in the
  design.
- **Decision, presented to the operator with both findings** (uv-editable
  demonstrably works when implemented correctly; `src-passthrough` is
  fully built, 23-review-round-hardened, and already has 2 real
  `dev`-branch adopters): **formally adopt `src-passthrough` as this
  effort's actual Phase 1 mechanism**, rather than switch course to the
  uv-editable form despite the sunk cost of re-verifying it works.
  Rationale for the choice, not just the sunk cost: `src-passthrough`
  reuses the *already-existing* `VENDOR_POINTER.json` marker/materialize/
  self-install machinery as-is (one generated stub file per conversion),
  where uv-editable would require *net-new* tooling this repo doesn't have
  yet — a TOML-aware drift/consistency guard, a promotion-time reference-
  rewriter, and per-lib edits to every consuming `pyproject.toml` (not
  just one file). Operator confirmed: adopt `src-passthrough`.
- **What this changes in the Plan above**: the Design Decision section is
  kept verbatim as the historical record of the first (superseded)
  resolution — struck through nowhere, just flagged at its own heading —
  so a future reader can see exactly what was decided and why it changed,
  rather than have it silently vanish. Phase 1's checklist items that
  assumed the uv-editable form (the conversion tool, the TOML drift guard,
  the materialize/promote reference-rewrite, the directory-pointer
  retirement) are marked `[x]` with a `~~struck-through~~` superseded
  description and a plain-text note pointing at what's ALREADY built and
  used instead (`--pointerize`, the existing `--check`/`materialize_main
  .py`/`preview_release.py` src-passthrough support) — none of that
  tooling needs building; it already exists. Real conversion progress
  (`lazy-cli-dispatch`, `work-coalescing-singleton`) is now tracked
  directly under the "convert every real vendored lib" item as sub-
  checkboxes. Phase 2 (installer engine) got a note flagging that its own
  live-reference design was a libs-mechanism corollary never
  re-evaluated against this pivot — still an open question for that
  phase, not resolved here.
- **Not yet done**: the remaining ~11 real lib copies still need
  conversion to `src-passthrough` (one bounded PR at a time, per this
  effort's own established pattern); Phase 2's installer-engine mechanism
  question is still open; Phase 3's pattern doc
  (`docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md`) still needs writing, and must now
  describe `src-passthrough`, not the uv-editable form.

### 2026-09-26 — Phase 1: converted `credential-relay` (PR #3904)

- Picked `credential-relay` as the next bounded slice: 4 consumers
  (`agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`) —
  tied with `ssh-manager` for the smallest remaining blast radius.
  Confirmed byte-identical across all 4 copies beforehand via
  `sync-vendored-libs.py --check` (no local per-plugin diffs to lose).
  Converted all 4 atomically in one commit via `--pointerize` (a partial
  conversion breaks `--check`'s copy-agreement comparison, per PR #3810's
  own earlier finding).
- Validated: `--check` reports all 4 as DRY pointer copies (clean); full
  `run-plugin-tests.py --reinstall` for all 4 affected plugins.
  `agent-containers` showed 1 failure — confirmed via `git stash`/rerun to
  fail IDENTICALLY with or without this conversion (a pre-existing,
  already-tracked flake, issue #3570, unrelated). `agent-bridge` appeared
  to hang under `--reinstall` on the first attempt; re-tested with more
  patience and confirmed it was just a slow venv rebuild, not a real hang
  (passed cleanly, twice, once without `--reinstall` and once with).
- **Round-1 review found a real, new-to-this-effort concern**: a plain
  non-editable `uv pip install <plugin-dir>` run directly against a live
  `dev` checkout raises `ImportError` for a src-passthrough-vendored lib
  (the installed copy is disconnected from the monorepo root the stub's
  `_find_repo_root()` walk needs). Reproduced empirically. Also reproduced
  the IDENTICAL failure for `lazy_cli_dispatch` (already-merged, PR #3790)
  — confirming this is a pre-existing gap in the mechanism itself, not
  something this PR introduced, and not something a single-lib conversion
  PR should fix ad-hoc. Filed **issue #3905** to track the real fix
  (teach `install.sh`/`install.ps1` to detect/refuse-or-materialize an
  unmaterialized pointer, or document it as a permanent dev-branch-install
  limitation) across all 3 current adopters uniformly. Confirmed this
  risk is currently DORMANT (no CI workflow does a non-editable plugin
  install today; `run-plugin-tests.py` always uses `-e`) — real exposure
  is a contributor manually running `install.sh` against their own `dev`
  checkout, a plausible but not currently-exercised workflow.
- Marked `credential-relay` `[x]` in Phase 1's conversion sub-checklist;
  noted `session-liveness-probe`/`venue-copilot` are NOT eligible for this
  conversion yet (no top-level canonical `libs/<lib>/` exists for either
  — `--pointerize` requires canonical first).
- **Not yet done**: ~10 remaining real lib copies (`ssh-manager` next,
  tied for smallest blast radius); issue #3905's actual fix; Phase 2;
  Phase 3's pattern doc.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 1: ssh-manager, config-migrate, single-instance-lease (PRs #3917, #3929, #3971)

- **`ssh-manager` (PR #3917)**: converted all 4 consumers. Found and
  fixed a second real, pre-existing bug: canonical `pyproject.toml`'s
  `name`/`build-system`/test-runner-constraint fields disagreed with
  every real copy (all 4 already agreed on `agent-ssh-manager`, a
  deliberate PyPI anti-squatting rename canonical never picked up) --
  `--pointerize`'s byte-for-byte copy surfaced this immediately as a real
  `uv pip install -e .` failure. Root cause: `--restore-canonical` only
  ever syncs `src/` and the version field, never these other fields --
  confirmed all 4 copies agreed with each other before fixing canonical
  to match. Also filed **issue #3915** for a second, unrelated
  pre-existing `agent-ssh` test flake found while validating.
- **`config-migrate` (PR #3929)**: converted all 5 consumers, including
  `agent-worktrees` itself -- the largest/most-critical consumer
  converted so far (full suite: 630+ passed, clean). Review re-surfaced
  the same non-editable-install gap (issue #3905) for these 5 new
  instances; extended that issue rather than re-litigating per-PR.
- **`single-instance-lease` (PR #3971)**: converted all 5 consumers
  (`agent-vault`, `agent-worktrees`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-mcp`,
  `agent-bridge`). Clean review (zero findings, approval recommended).
  Merge was briefly blocked by an unrelated, already-tracked `dev`-wide
  `guards + lint` break (issue #3967, a `customizing-copilot` skill-doc
  false positive) -- confirmed pre-existing/unrelated via `git stash`
  before investigating a fix; another session/process fixed it upstream
  during this PR's review window, so a rebase-and-repush was all that was
  needed once confirmed.
- **Running total this session**: 4 more real libs converted
  (`credential-relay`, `ssh-manager`, `config-migrate`,
  `single-instance-lease`), on top of `lazy-cli-dispatch` and
  `work-coalescing-singleton` from earlier -- **6 of 13 total real libs
  now converted**. Two genuine pre-existing tool/canonical bugs found and
  fixed along the way (this entry's `ssh-manager` note, plus PR #3810's
  nested-`__pycache__` fix). Two pre-existing test flakes confirmed
  unrelated and tracked (issue #3570, already tracked; issue #3915,
  newly filed). Separately, an unrelated `dev`-wide `guards + lint` CI
  failure (issue #3967 -- a `check-marketplace-isolation.py` false
  positive, not a test flake) briefly blocked #3971's merge; resolved
  upstream by another session during that PR's review window.
- **Not yet done**: 5 real lib copies remain eligible for conversion
  (`agent-procutil` — 11 consumers, the largest; `dropin-registry` — 9;
  `plugin-activation`/`plugin-resolve` — 7 each, tied smallest remaining;
  `zdd` — 8); `session-liveness-probe`/`venue-copilot` still need a
  canonical-promotion step first; issue #3905's actual cross-adopter fix;
  Phase 2 (installer engine, still an open design question); Phase 3's
  pattern doc. Next session should continue with `plugin-activation` or
  `plugin-resolve` (tied smallest), one bounded PR at a time, per this
  effort's own established pattern.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 1: plugin-activation (PR #4004)

- Converted all 8 real consumers (`customizing-copilot`, `agent-worktrees`,
  `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-machines`,
  `agent-codespaces`, `worktree-manager`). Found and fixed a THIRD real,
  pre-existing bug this effort has now surfaced: `customizing-copilot`'s
  `installing-plugins` skill script (`plugin-activation.py`) loaded
  `plugin_activation/state.py` by hardcoded file path, deliberately
  bypassing the package's own `__init__.py` to avoid a PyYAML dependency
  (`state.py` itself is stdlib-only, used standalone outside any plugin's
  installed venv) -- broke once the local copy became a pointer stub with
  no physical `state.py`. Fixed by teaching the loader to check for the
  local copy's own `VENDOR_POINTER.json` and resolve `state.py` through
  its `source` field when present, still never importing the package
  itself (preserving the original yaml-avoidance design). Verified via a
  repo-wide grep that no OTHER script has this same hardcoded-path-load
  pattern for any of this effort's converted libs.
- Review re-surfaced the same non-editable-install gap (issue #3905) for
  6 new consumer instances, several with specific `install.sh`/`init.sh`
  line citations from the reviewer -- extended that issue again rather
  than fixing ad-hoc; the accumulating line citations are useful grounding
  for whoever eventually picks up the real cross-adopter fix.
- **Running total, this whole session**: 5 more real libs converted
  (`credential-relay`, `ssh-manager`, `config-migrate`,
  `single-instance-lease`, `plugin-activation`), on top of
  `lazy-cli-dispatch` and `work-coalescing-singleton` from earlier --
  **7 of 13 total real libs now converted, just over half**. Three
  genuine pre-existing bugs found and fixed along the way (two canonical/
  tool bugs: PR #3810's nested-`__pycache__` fix and this session's
  `ssh-manager` canonical-drift fix; one consumer-side bug: this entry's
  `plugin-activation.py` hardcoded-path fix). Also resolved a genuine
  design-decision conflict discovered mid-session (this effort's README
  had documented a superseded `uv`-editable mechanism; formally adopted
  `src-passthrough` instead, per the "Course correction" entry above).
- **Not yet done**: 4 real lib copies remain eligible for conversion
  (`agent-procutil` — 11 consumers, the largest remaining; `dropin-
  registry` — 9; `plugin-resolve` — 7, now the smallest remaining; `zdd`
  — 8); `session-liveness-probe`/`venue-copilot` still need a canonical-
  promotion step first; issue #3905's actual cross-adopter fix (now
  spanning 7 adopters' worth of evidence); Phase 2 (installer engine,
  still an open design question, unrelated to libs' pivot); Phase 3's
  pattern doc (`docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md`, still unwritten and
  must describe `src-passthrough`). Next session should continue with
  `plugin-resolve` (now smallest remaining at 7 consumers), one bounded
  PR at a time, per this effort's own established pattern -- the
  workflow is now well-proven: pick smallest remaining consumer count,
  confirm `--check` shows no drift, `--pointerize` every consumer
  atomically, validate with `run-plugin-tests.py` per affected plugin
  (watch for pre-existing flakes via `git stash`/rerun before assuming a
  failure is caused by the conversion), fix any real regressions found
  (usually a hardcoded direct-file-path load bypassing the package
  `__init__.py`, per this session's two tool/consumer-side bugs), journal,
  commit, open PR, address review (expect the same non-editable-install
  finding every time -- defer to #3905), merge.

### 2026-09-27 — Second course correction: reverting to `uv`-editable, superseding `src-passthrough`

- **Why this was revisited**: the operator had originally recommended the
  npm-workspace `node_modules`-swap idea (a different, independent agent
  turned that into the `uv`-editable Design Decision above); after 7 libs
  were converted to `src-passthrough` instead (this effort's own prior
  course correction), the operator asked for the `uv` pathway to be
  properly analyzed rather than left un-re-examined just because
  `src-passthrough` was already shipped -- a legitimate concern given the
  first "adopt src-passthrough" decision leaned heavily on sunk cost
  (tooling already built) without properly re-weighing `src-passthrough`'s
  own structural risk (issue #3905), which by this point had recurred on
  every single one of the 7 conversions.
- **Re-examined the exact claim the original `uv`-editable investigation
  asserted but never verified under the RIGHT conditions**: the
  Design Decision above already noted "`editable = true` forces an
  editable install of that dependency even when the top-level package is
  installed non-editable" -- but neither that original investigation NOR
  this effort's later validation trial (round 1 of the first course
  correction, which only tested `-e` on BOTH the top-level package and
  its dependencies) had actually verified this specific combination: a
  NON-editable top-level install with an `editable = true` dependency.
  Ran the precise reproduction this time: copied `agent-mcp` + 4 canonical
  libs to an isolated scratch dir, rewrote `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[tool.uv.sources]` to reference canonical directly with `editable =
  true`, then ran `uv pip install --python <py> plugins/agent-mcp` --
  deliberately WITHOUT `-e` this time, matching exactly what
  `install.sh`'s real invocation does for the top-level package.
  **Result: `agent_mcp.__file__` resolved into `site-packages` (a real,
  disconnected copy, as expected for a non-editable install), but
  `agent_procutil.__file__` (the dependency, `editable = true`) still
  resolved DIRECTLY to the canonical source path, live, un-copied.**
  `uv`'s per-dependency `editable` flag is independent of the top-level
  package's own install mode -- confirmed, not assumed.
- **This is the property `src-passthrough` structurally lacks**: a
  non-editable install of a `src-passthrough`-vendored plugin copies the
  generated STUB FILE itself into `site-packages`, severing its
  `__file__`-based repo-root walk from the monorepo entirely (confirmed
  independently across all 7 conversions as issue #3905). `uv`-editable's
  dependency reference never gets copied at all regardless of the
  top-level's install mode, so it doesn't share this failure mode for a
  live dev-checkout install.
- **The scoped limit of this advantage, stated honestly**: it only helps
  the "install directly against a live monorepo checkout" scenario (a
  contributor running `install.sh` locally). It does NOT help production:
  a real end-user install happens from a materialized `main` release with
  no monorepo `libs/` sibling at all, where an un-rewritten `editable =
  true` reference would point at a path that simply doesn't exist --
  which is exactly why the ORIGINAL Design Decision already mandated a
  promotion-time rewrite step (drop `editable`, repoint locally) before
  ANY of this ships. That rewrite step, the TOML drift/consistency guard,
  and the conversion tool were never built in the earlier attempt (Phase 1
  got redirected to `src-passthrough` before reaching them) -- they still
  don't exist and must be built before this mechanism is production-ready
  for even one real lib.
- **Presented the full tradeoff to the operator** (structural robustness
  advantage vs. real rework cost: reverting/re-converting the 7 already-
  shipped libs, building the still-missing promotion rewriter/drift-guard/
  conversion-tool, editing every consuming `pyproject.toml` per lib
  instead of one stub file) and asked how to proceed. **Operator decided:
  switch course to `uv`-editable, accept the rework cost.**
- **What this changes**: the Design Decision section is restored to
  "current" (no longer marked superseded) with a new status note
  explaining the double-reversal; Phase 1's Plan items are un-struck back
  to active, with the src-passthrough-specific sub-items preserved as
  historical notes (what was tried, why it's being undone) rather than
  deleted; a new Plan sub-item tracks re-converting the 7 already-shipped
  libs back to this form, smallest-blast-radius first, same as the
  original forward-conversion order; the Validation Plan's superseded
  criteria are un-struck, plus a NEW criterion added (the non-editable
  top-level install property that motivated this reversal in the first
  place) so it's demonstrated directly per conversion, not just inferred.
- **Not yet done**: none of the actually-new tooling exists yet --
  the conversion tool (bidirectional: convert AND re-convert), the TOML
  drift/consistency guard, the promotion-time reference-rewriter in
  `materialize_main.py`/`promote_release.py`, and the `preview_release.py`
  equivalent. Next session should build these first, proven against
  exactly one already-`src-passthrough` lib (smallest: `lazy-cli-dispatch`,
  1 consumer) before doing the bulk re-conversion of the other 6 -- per
  this effort's own established "prove on one before bulk" pattern.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 1: uv-editable tooling built and proved on lazy-cli-dispatch (PR #4245)

- **Built the three previously-missing pieces of tooling** the second
  course correction left open: `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable
  CONSUMER LIB` (bidirectional conversion tool -- real copy or
  `src-passthrough` pointer copy, either direction, into the `uv`-editable
  form; refuses to discard a drifted real copy), a new drift/consistency
  guard folded into `--check` (recognizes an escaping `[tool.uv.sources]`
  entry, verifies `editable = true` and canonical existence, across both
  `plugins/<plugin>` and `worktree-manager` consumers), and a promotion-
  time reference-rewriter in both `materialize_main.py` and
  `preview_release.py` (copies canonical's complete lib tree -- `src/`,
  `README.md`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml` -- into the consumer's own
  `libs/<lib>/` and rewrites the entry back to the plain local form).
- **`sync-vendored-libs.py` crossed the repo's 1000-line module-size cap**
  once the new tooling landed -- split two purely-additive pieces into
  their own modules (`tools/uv_editable_ref.py`, a normal importable
  module with no logic risk from the extraction; `tools/
  passthrough_pointer_template.py`, a plain string-constant move with zero
  logic change) rather than touching the pre-existing `src-passthrough`
  writer itself, keeping the componentization scoped to only the code this
  session actually added.
- **Proved the whole pipeline on `lazy-cli-dispatch`** (smallest, 1
  consumer) exactly as planned: converted `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/
  lazy-cli-dispatch` from `src-passthrough` to `uv`-editable -- no local
  directory remains. Validated end-to-end, not just unit-tested:
  `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`/`check-vendored-libs-sync.py`/`check-
  install-contract.py` all pass; `run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees
  --reinstall`'s full suite (all 10 sub-suites) passes with no local copy
  present; a **non-editable** `uv pip install <plugin-dir>` in a fresh
  venv (no `-e`) still resolved `agent-lazy-cli-dispatch` live from
  canonical -- the exact property this effort's second course correction
  was staked on, confirmed for a real lib, not just the earlier isolated
  `agent-mcp` reproduction; `materialize_main.py` expands the reference
  into a byte-for-byte lossless copy at promotion time, confirmed against
  the real repo tree.
- **Filed as PR #4245**, targeting `dev`. Journaled here per this effort's
  own "even for pure documentation" convention, but this entry is itself
  part of that same PR (not a separate follow-up commit).
- **Merged 2026-09-27 (admin-merge, operator-authorized)**. The automated
  reviewer drove the PR through 13 review rounds, surfacing (and this
  session fixing) 29 distinct findings -- fail-closed promotion gaps,
  TOML-table-scoping, several nested/ancestor/early-resolve symlink
  hardenings, path-traversal via an unsafe lib name, alias-materialization,
  Python 3.10 `tomllib` compatibility, and more (see the individual commits
  on the merged PR for the full list; each was replied-to inline with the
  fixing commit). The last two review rounds both reported "Findings:
  None," but the automated reviewer's own review state never flipped to a
  formal GitHub "Approved" (stayed "COMMENTED") even after a manual re-ping
  -- the operator judged the PR clean given zero remaining findings across
  two consecutive rounds and authorized an admin-merge (bypassing the
  stuck required-review gate) rather than waiting further on a reviewer
  quirk outside this effort's own scope to fix.
- **Still open for the next session**: re-convert the remaining 6
  `src-passthrough` libs (`work-coalescing-singleton` next by blast-radius,
  then the tied pairs), convert the 4 never-yet-`src-passthrough` real
  libs directly, retire the `src-passthrough` pointer kind once all 7 are
  re-converted, then Phase 2 (installer engine) and Phase 3 (pattern doc)
  -- see the Plan section above for the full ordering, unchanged by this
  session. The tooling built and hardened in PR #4245
  (`--uv-editable`, the `--check` drift guard, and the promotion-time
  rewriter) is now proven end-to-end and ready to apply directly to each
  remaining lib with no further tooling work expected -- only the
  re-conversion + validation cycle per lib.

### 2026-09-27 — Phase 1: converted `work-coalescing-singleton` (2 consumers)

- Applied the proven recipe from the `lazy-cli-dispatch` conversion (PR
  #4245) to the next-smallest-blast-radius `src-passthrough` lib:
  `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable` for both consumers
  (`plugins/agent-worktrees`, `worktree-manager`), hand-updated each
  consumer's `[tool.uv.sources]` prose comment to describe the new
  `uv`-editable mechanism, then validated end-to-end: `sync-vendored-
  libs.py --check`/`check-vendored-libs-sync.py`/`check-install-
  contract.py` all green; `run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees
  --reinstall`'s full suite completed with 433 passed, 8 skipped, and 2
  pre-existing failures (`test_lazy_dispatch.py`'s dispatch-table/cluster-
  free-modules drift checks, confirmed pre-existing and unrelated by
  re-running the identical suite against the unmodified `dev` tip via
  `git stash`);
  `worktree-manager` has no `run-plugin-tests.py` suite of its own, so ran
  its real test suite directly via `uv run --extra dev` (1532 passed, 4
  skipped, before the review-round additions below); a **non-editable**
  `uv pip install plugins/agent-worktrees` in
  a fresh venv (no `-e`) still resolved `agent-work-coalescing-singleton`
  live from canonical (`__file__` pointed at `libs/work-coalescing-
  singleton`, not a copy); `materialize_main.py --dest` round-tripped
  both consumers' pointers byte-for-byte (only `.ruff_cache`/`__pycache__`
  diffs, both non-source cache artifacts).
- **Caught and fixed a self-inflicted false alarm mid-validation**: the
  non-editable-install probe's `uv pip install` build step left stray
  `build/`/`*.egg-info` directories under `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/
  work-coalescing-singleton/` (untracked build cruft from building the
  path-dependency sdist), which made the directory reappear on disk and
  caused `materialize_main.py` to report a false `SKIP ... already exists
  -- refusing to overwrite` for that one pointer. Removed the untracked
  cruft and re-ran; the pointer materialized cleanly (`OK`) on the next
  pass. Worth remembering for the remaining libs: re-check for stray
  build artifacts after any non-editable-install probe, before trusting a
  `materialize_main.py` `SKIP`/warning as a real regression.
- Added a changefile per touched plugin (`agent-worktrees`,
  `worktree-manager`) -- later reduced to just `agent-worktrees` (see
  below): the `worktree-manager` changefiles were removed once identified
  as dead weight for a standalone-versioned, non-marketplace payload.
- **Filed as PR #4331**, targeting `dev`. The GitHub-native automated
  reviewer's first pass surfaced a real, previously-unrecognized gap in
  this conversion recipe (2 High findings), fixed in the same PR:
  - **`worktree-manager`'s own standalone self-install/self-update path
    had no way to expand a `uv`-editable canonical reference.**
    `worktree_manager/self_install.py`'s `_materialize_payload_pointers()`
    (and its hand-maintained, statically-shipped
    `_trusted_pointer_materializer.py` -- kept separate from
    `tools/materialize_main.py` on purpose; see that module's own
    docstring for the trusted-vs-untrusted-fetch rationale) only ever knew
    how to expand the OLDER `VENDOR_POINTER.json` directory-pointer form.
    A `uv`-editable consumer manifest entry (this conversion's own output)
    was invisible to it -- a self-installed or self-updated Manager slot
    would ship an escaping `path = "../libs/work-coalescing-singleton"`
    reference that can never resolve outside a monorepo checkout, breaking
    every deployed Manager on next self-update. Ported
    `materialize_uv_editable_ref_into()` and the `find_uv_editable_refs()`/
    `uv_sources_table_span()` helpers it depends on (mirroring
    `tools/materialize_main.py`/`tools/uv_editable_ref.py`) into the
    trusted module, wired `_materialize_payload_pointers()` to discover
    and expand escaping `[tool.uv.sources]` entries alongside the existing
    directory-pointer discovery (failing closed the same way: no canonical
    `libs/` reachable from the fetched payload is a hard error, not a
    silent skip), and added 3 new parity tests to
    `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` (clean expansion, missing
    `editable = true` refusal, symlinked-canonical refusal) alongside the
    existing 6 directory-pointer scenarios.
  - **`worktree-manager` is a standalone-versioned payload, not a
    marketplace plugin** -- a plugin changefile alone never bumps
    `worktree_manager/__init__.py`'s own `__version__`
    (`self_install()`'s actual publication gate), so an already-installed
    machine would never pick up this fix. Bumped `__version__` (and the
    matching `worktree-manager/pyproject.toml` `version`)
    `0.1.0-dev93` -> `0.1.0-dev94`, confirmed via
    `tools/check-version-consistency.py`, per this repo's own established
    per-fix version-bump convention (see the `self_install.py` git history
    cited in this same review round).
  - Also tightened this journal's own wording per a Low finding: the
    validation bullet above previously read as an unqualified "passes"
    despite reporting 2 failures in the same sentence -- reworded to state
    the pass/skip/pre-existing-failure counts unambiguously.
  - Re-ran the full validation battery after these fixes:
    `run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees --reinstall` still 433 passed, 8
    skipped, the same 2 pre-existing failures; `worktree-manager`'s own
    suite now 1535 passed (+3 new parity tests), 4 skipped;
    `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`/`check-vendored-libs-sync.py`/`check-
    install-contract.py`/`check-version-consistency.py` all green.
  - **Second review round found 2 more real findings** (the two High
    findings above also reappeared as still-"Open" in the reviewer's own
    round-over-round summary -- confirmed against the current file state
    that both were already fixed by the prior commit; this is the same
    "stale carry-over" behavior this effort's own handoff notes already
    document, not a re-regression):
    - **Medium: the two `worktree-manager`-targeted changefiles were dead
      weight.** `accumulate_bumps.compute()` resolves a changefile's
      `plugin` entry via `plugins/<name>/plugin.json`; `worktree-manager`
      has no such path (it's a standalone-versioned payload, not a
      marketplace plugin), so both changefiles would be silently skipped
      by the release bump pipeline -- and the version was already bumped
      by hand in the prior commit, so they added nothing. Removed both
      (`git rm`); the `agent-worktrees`-targeted changefile (a real
      marketplace plugin) stays.
    - **Medium: the new parity tests only called
      `materialize_uv_editable_ref_into()` directly**, never exercising
      `_materialize_payload_pointers()`'s own control flow (discovery,
      canonical-root selection, failure normalization, slot-publication)
      through the real `self_install()` entry point. Added 2 tests to
      `test_self_install.py` mirroring the existing directory-pointer
      pair (`test_self_install_materializes_a_vendor_pointer_from_a_live_
      monorepo` / `test_self_install_raises_when_pointer_present_
      without_monorepo_ancestor`): one confirms a full `self_install()`
      run expands an escaping `uv`-editable reference into a real local
      copy and rewrites the manifest before publishing; the other
      confirms `self_install()` reports `action="error"` and publishes no
      slot when no monorepo ancestor is reachable to resolve the
      reference from.
    - Re-validated after these fixes: `worktree-manager`'s own suite now
      1537 passed (+2 more), 4 skipped; `check-changefile-presence.py
      --base <pre-PR dev tip>` OK (every touched plugin has a pending
      changefile); all other guards (`sync-vendored-libs.py --check`/
      `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`/`check-install-contract.py`/`check-
      version-consistency.py`) still green.
  - **Third review round**: the reviewer's own "Resolved since last
    review" list confirmed both Medium findings above (the dead
    changefiles, the missing self-install-level tests) as fixed. It also
    re-listed the two prior High findings (self-install materializer,
    self-install parity tests) as still "Open" despite both already
    being addressed by the prior commit -- re-verified against the
    current file state (`self_install.py`'s `_materialize_payload_
    pointers` still calls `materializer.find_uv_editable_refs`/
    `materialize_uv_editable_ref_into`; both new tests still present and
    passing in `test_self_install.py`) and treated as the SAME documented
    reviewer lag (stale round-over-round carry-over), not a real
    regression -- no code change made for those two. One genuinely NEW
    finding: this journal's own "Added a changefile per touched plugin
    (agent-worktrees, worktree-manager)" bullet (and the PR description's
    matching claim) were left stale after the `worktree-manager`
    changefiles were removed two commits later. Reworded the journal
    bullet in place; updated the PR description on GitHub to match.
  - **Fourth review round**: one genuinely new finding -- deleting a
    consumer's pointer copy also deletes the lib tests that consumer's
    own root-level `pytest` run used to collect (`worktree-manager`
    declares no `testpaths`, so `uv run pytest` walked `libs/*/tests`),
    leaving `work-coalescing-singleton`'s wire/server coverage
    unenforced. Added a `checks`-job CI step that runs the CANONICAL
    suites directly (`libs/work-coalescing-singleton/tests` plus
    `libs/lazy-cli-dispatch/tests`, whose coverage the earlier PR #4245
    conversion dropped the same way), mirroring the existing
    `peer-launch`/`installer-readiness` canonical-lib steps. Verified
    locally: 42 passed.
- **Next up**: `credential-relay` (4 consumers), per the effort's own
  smallest-blast-radius-first ordering. Its conversion (and every later
  one) must extend that canonical-lib CI step with the newly converted
  lib, so no lib loses its suite the same way.

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `credential-relay` (4 consumers)

- Applied the now-standard recipe to `credential-relay`'s 4 consumers
  (`agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`):
  `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable` per consumer, hand-updated
  each consumer's `[tool.uv.sources]` prose comment, added
  `libs/credential-relay/tests/conftest.py` and extended the CI canonical-
  lib test step (PR #4331's own fix, applied proactively this time rather
  than as a follow-up review finding) to run `libs/credential-relay/tests`
  alongside the other two canonical suites.
- Validated end-to-end: `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`/`check-vendored-
  libs-sync.py`/`check-install-contract.py` all green; all 4 consumers'
  full plugin suites via `run-plugin-tests.py <plugin> --reinstall`:
  `agent-mcp` (358+258 passed across sub-suites), `agent-bridge` (225
  passed, 10 skipped), `agent-codespaces` (294+41 passed) all fully
  green; `agent-containers` (137 passed, 1 skipped, 1 pre-existing
  failure in `test_worktrees_peer.py` unrelated to this lib -- confirmed
  via `git stash` against unmodified `dev` tip, same single failure).
  Non-editable install probe (`uv pip install plugins/agent-bridge`, no
  `-e`) -- `credential_relay.__file__` resolved live to canonical, not a
  frozen copy. `materialize_main.py --dest` round-tripped all 4 pointers
  byte-for-byte (no source drift; cache-artifact-only diffs).
- **Caught the same stray-build-artifact false alarm as the previous
  lib** (documented in the prior journal entry, now a known pattern for
  this recipe): the non-editable-install probe left an empty stray
  `plugins/agent-containers/libs/credential-relay/src/` directory,
  which made `materialize_main.py` report a false `SKIP ... already
  exists` for that one pointer. Removed it and re-ran; materialized
  cleanly.
- **`libs/credential-relay/tests/test_az_login.py`'s `az`-CLI-dependent
  tests fail locally in a sandbox with no `az` binary on `PATH`**
  (`shutil.which("az")` gates real resolution before the test's own
  subprocess mock ever intercepts) -- confirmed environment-only, not a
  regression: stubbing a fake `az` executable onto `PATH` made all 112
  tests in the file pass. GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` runners ship
  Azure CLI preinstalled, so the new CI step is expected to pass there
  even though it can fail in a bare local sandbox.
- Added a changefile per touched plugin (`agent-containers`, `agent-mcp`,
  `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`); no changefile needed for the
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` step extension
  (`check-changefile-presence.py` confirmed clean without one).
- **Filed as PR #4363**, targeting `dev`. First review round found 2 real
  findings, fixed in the same PR: (1) the new CI step's `checks` job only
  installs bare `pytest` (never `pytest-asyncio`, which `credential-relay`'s
  own suite needs for its `@pytest.mark.asyncio` tests) -- added an
  explicit `pip install pytest-asyncio` to that step; (2) missed this
  repo's required **Documentation impact** PR-description statement
  (CONTRIBUTING.md) -- added one explaining why no authoritative doc
  besides this effort's own journal is affected by an internal Phase 1
  re-conversion.
- **Next up**: `ssh-manager` (4 consumers), per the effort's own
  smallest-blast-radius-first ordering. **Remember the Documentation
  impact PR-description statement going forward** -- missed on both this
  PR and #4331 (which already merged without it).

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `ssh-manager` (4 consumers) + `agent-procutil` (early, same 4 consumers)

- Applied the standard recipe to `ssh-manager`'s 4 consumers (`agent-ssh`,
  `agent-containers`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`):
  `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable` per consumer, hand-updated
  each `[tool.uv.sources]` prose comment.
- **Real, previously-undocumented structural finding**: `uv pip install
  --reinstall` for `agent-ssh` failed outright with `Requirements contain
  conflicting URLs for package agent-procutil` -- `libs/ssh-manager`'s OWN
  `pyproject.toml` declares a dependency on `agent-procutil` (unlike every
  lib converted so far, which had zero dependencies), resolved via its own
  `[tool.uv.sources]` entry pointing at canonical `libs/agent-procutil`.
  Every one of `ssh-manager`'s 4 consumers ALSO directly depends on
  `agent-procutil` -- but still via each consumer's own OLD local vendored
  copy. `uv` sees two different resolutions (a copy path vs. canonical)
  for the same distribution name and refuses to resolve at all. **This
  changes the effort's understood safe ordering**: a lib with its own
  vendored-lib dependencies (also true of `plugin-activation`, which
  depends on `agent-dropin-registry`/`agent-plugin-resolve`) cannot be
  converted ahead of that dependency for any shared consumer -- the
  dependency must be converted first (or bundled into the same PR) for
  every affected consumer. Resolved here by converting `agent-procutil`
  to `uv`-editable early, for these same 4 consumers only (7 of its other
  11 consumers remain real copies for now, untouched, since they don't
  share this conflict) -- confirmed `sync-vendored-libs.py --check` treats
  this mixed per-consumer state as valid (same DRY-pointer-copy-exclusion
  pattern already established for other partially-converted libs).
- **Second real finding, caught only after fixing the first**: even with
  matching file paths, `uv` STILL refused to resolve --
  `libs/ssh-manager/pyproject.toml`'s own `agent-procutil` source entry
  lacked `editable = true`, conflicting with the now-editable entry from
  each consumer's own direct dependency on the same path. **General rule
  surfaced**: any canonical lib's OWN internal dependency on another
  vendored lib must ALSO declare `editable = true`, not just the
  consumer-facing entries -- fixed in `libs/ssh-manager/pyproject.toml`
  directly.
- **Third real finding**: `agent-bridge`'s own
  `test_install_ssh_manager_selectors.py` read
  `PLUGIN/libs/ssh-manager/pyproject.toml` directly to cross-check its
  Windows installer's hardcoded distribution-name selectors -- broke once
  the local copy was deleted. `install.ps1`'s own `Resolve-VendoredLib`
  already had a two-tier fallback (local copy, then the `../../libs/<lib>`
  git-checkout-layout canonical path) so the REAL installer was never at
  risk -- only the test's own path resolution needed the same fallback.
  Fixed by adding an equivalent two-tier resolver to the test.
- **Fourth finding, a genuine (dormant) pre-existing bug surfaced for the
  first time**: extending the CI canonical-lib test step to
  `libs/ssh-manager/tests` (per the by-now-standard practice) uncovered
  `test_force_evicts_live_holder` failing 100% reproducibly, unrelated to
  this conversion -- these tests were NEVER actually collected by any
  consumer's own plugin suite before (confirmed: `agent-bridge`'s test
  count was identical, 225, both before and after this whole effort's
  conversions), so this bug had never been exercised in CI at all. Root
  cause: the test spawns a child via bare `subprocess.Popen` and discards
  the handle without ever reaping it; `_terminate()` (production code)
  sends `SIGTERM` then polls `pid_alive()` (`os.kill(pid, 0)`) waiting for
  it to report "gone" -- but an un-reaped terminated child becomes a
  zombie, which `os.kill(pid, 0)` reports as alive indefinitely. Real
  production usage never hits this (a lock holder is typically an
  unrelated process already reparented to init, which reaps it for free)
  -- purely a test-harness artifact. Fixed by having the test spawn a
  daemon thread blocked in `Popen.wait()` to reap the child the moment it
  actually exits; confirmed stable across 3 repeated runs.
- Added `libs/ssh-manager/tests/conftest.py` and
  `libs/agent-procutil/tests/conftest.py`; extended the CI canonical-lib
  test step to run both (`agent-procutil`'s canonical suite is included
  even though only 4 of 11 consumers are converted so far, since the step
  is meant to test the canonical copy directly, independent of any
  particular consumer's pointer form).
- Validated end-to-end: all 4 consumers' full plugin suites green except
  each one's own single already-confirmed-pre-existing failure
  (`agent-ssh`: `test_host_restore.py`; `agent-containers`:
  `test_worktrees_peer.py`; both re-confirmed via `git stash` against
  unmodified `dev`); `agent-bridge`/`agent-codespaces` fully green.
  Non-editable install probe (fresh venv, `uv pip install
  plugins/agent-ssh`, no `-e`) -- both `ssh_manager.__file__` and
  `agent_procutil.__file__` resolved live to canonical, confirming the
  nested-dependency case works too. `materialize_main.py --dest`
  round-tripped all 8 pointers (4 `ssh-manager` + 4 `agent-procutil`)
  byte-for-byte.
- **Repeated the same stray-build-artifact false alarm** from the
  `work-coalescing-singleton` conversion, twice more this round (once in
  a consumer's `libs/agent-procutil`, once in canonical
  `libs/agent-procutil/src`, once in a leftover empty
  `plugins/agent-ssh/libs/ssh-manager` directory) -- all self-inflicted by
  this session's own non-editable-install probes and `--reinstall` test
  runs. Cleaning stray `build/`/`*.egg-info`/empty directories before
  trusting any `--refuses to discard local changes`/`SKIP ... already
  exists` message is now this effort's standing practice for every
  remaining lib.
- Added a changefile per touched plugin (`agent-ssh`, `agent-containers`,
  `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`).
- **Filed as PR #4372**, targeting `dev`. First review round found 2 real
  findings (1 critical, 1 moderate), fixed in the same PR:
  - **Critical: promotion left conflicting editability in nested path
    dependencies.** `materialize_uv_editable_ref_into()`'s outer rewrite
    only fixed the CONSUMER's own top-level `[tool.uv.sources]` entry --
    a just-copied canonical lib's OWN nested entry (`ssh-manager`'s own
    dependency on `agent-procutil`) was left untouched, still
    `editable = true`. A real `main` release would then require the SAME
    path both editable (the nested entry) and non-editable (the
    consumer's rewritten entry) at once, which `uv` refuses to resolve --
    a genuine promotion-correctness bug, not just a dev-checkout issue.
    Added `_materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs()` (and its own
    `_rewrite_nested_uv_editable_entry()`, which drops `editable = true`
    while keeping the nested entry's `path` UNCHANGED -- unlike the
    top-level rewrite's different `libs/<lib>` form, a nested reference's
    relative path already resolves correctly once its target lib is
    materialized at the matching relative depth) to `tools/
    materialize_main.py`, mirrored into the trusted
    `_trusted_pointer_materializer.py` copy for `self_install.py`. Added
    4 new tests (2 in `test_materialize_main.py`, 2 in
    `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py`) covering the clean nested-fixup
    case, the "dependency already materialized by a sibling top-level
    entry" alias case, and the missing-`editable = true` refusal case.
    Verified against the REAL repo tree too (not just synthetic tests):
    `materialize_main.py --dest <tmp>` now correctly produces
    `agent-procutil = { path = "../agent-procutil" }` (no `editable`) in
    every promoted `ssh-manager` copy.
  - **Moderate: the pip-fallback install path in `agent-ssh`'s own
    `install.sh`/`install.ps1` still hardcoded the removed plugin-local
    `libs/ssh-manager`/`libs/agent-procutil` paths.** If `uv` is
    unavailable or fails in a source checkout, the fallback would supply
    nonexistent directories and installation would fail outright. Ported
    the `_resolve_vendored_lib`/`Resolve-VendoredLib` two-tier (local
    copy, then canonical `../../libs/<lib>`) resolver -- already
    established in `agent-bridge`'s own install scripts for an earlier
    conversion -- into `agent-ssh`'s scripts too, and updated
    `_install_agent_ssh_package`/`Install-AgentSshPackage`'s vendored-deps
    list to use it for these 2 libs. (Checked `agent-containers` --no
    such fallback exists there at all-- and `agent-codespaces` --already
    had an equivalent two-tier fallback for `ssh-manager`, and never
    hardcoded `agent-procutil` at all, resolving it via normal `uv`
    dependency resolution instead-- neither needed a change.) Updated
    `test_installer_fallback.py`'s existing test to extract the resolver
    functions too (not just the install function) and added a new test
    proving the canonical fallback path resolves correctly when no local
    copy exists.
  - Re-validated after both fixes: `test_materialize_main.py` 70 passed;
    `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` 10 passed;
    `test_installer_fallback.py` 2 passed + 1 skipped (Windows-only);
    `run-plugin-tests.py agent-ssh --reinstall` 172 passed, 7 skipped, the
    same 1 pre-existing failure; `worktree-manager`'s own full suite 1548
    passed, 4 skipped; all guards
    (`sync-vendored-libs.py --check`/`check-vendored-libs-sync.py`/
    `check-install-contract.py`/`check-version-consistency.py`) green.
  - **`tools/materialize_main.py` crossed the repo's 1000-line module-size
    cap** once the nested-fixup landed (1011 lines) -- split the two new
    functions (`materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs`/
    `rewrite_nested_uv_editable_entry`, plus their own small private
    helpers) into a new `tools/nested_uv_editable_ref.py`, matching this
    same session's earlier PR #4245 precedent for handling this exact
    cap. `materialize_main.py` now 873 lines, the new module 219;
    `check-module-size.py` confirmed green; re-verified the whole test
    suite (70 passed) and the real-repo materialize round-trip still
    produce identical output after the move.
  - **Second review round found 2 more real hardening findings** in the
    new nested-fixup code, both symlink/traversal-class issues this
    effort's own established pattern already guards against on the
    OUTER (top-level) path -- the nested path had missed both:
    - **Path-traversal**: `materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs` only
      checked the resolved nested destination didn't ESCAPE the whole
      snapshot root, not that it equalled the EXACT expected sibling
      (`<consumer>/libs/<nested_lib>`, derived independently of
      `raw_path`). A crafted nested `raw_path` such as
      `../../plugins/other` would still be "inside" the snapshot yet
      copy canonical content into an unrelated project's directory while
      the manifest kept pointing at the wrong path. Fixed by comparing
      the resolved destination against the independently-derived
      expected sibling exactly, mirroring the outer function's own
      `canonical != canonical_unresolved.resolve()` pattern.
    - **Symlink resolved-before-checked**: the canonical path was
      `.resolve()`-d BEFORE its ancestor symlink check ran, so a
      symlinked canonical lib would resolve to its external target
      first and the subsequent check would see no symlink at all. Fixed
      by checking the UNRESOLVED path's ancestors first, then resolving
      only after confirming no symlink -- same ordering the outer
      function already used.
    - Added 2 regression tests (`test_materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs_
      refuses_a_path_traversal_raw_path`,
      `test_materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs_refuses_a_symlinked_
      canonical`) to `test_materialize_main.py`; mirrored the identical
      hardening into the trusted `_trusted_pointer_materializer.py` copy.
      Re-validated: `test_materialize_main.py` 72 passed;
      `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` 10 passed; worktree-manager's
      own full suite 1548 passed, 4 skipped; real-repo materialize
      round-trip and all other guards still green.
  - **Third review round found 2 more real hardening findings + 1 new
    finding from itself**: `materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs` treated
    ANY pre-existing path at the expected sibling location as "already
    materialized" without verifying it -- accepting a non-directory
    artifact (a regular file) or a stale/mismatched prior copy, either of
    which would rewrite the manifest over content the promoted package
    couldn't actually import correctly. Fixed by requiring the existing
    path be a real directory AND byte-identical to canonical (reusing
    `uv_editable_ref.py`'s own `lib_tree_matches`, already built for
    exactly this "does this copy match canonical" comparison) before
    treating it as equivalent to a fresh copy; refuse a symlink,
    non-directory, or mismatched directory outright instead. Mirrored
    into the trusted copy (which needed its own local `_file_hashes`/
    `_lib_tree_matches`, since it can't import `uv_editable_ref.py`).
  - **Caught and fixed a self-inflicted false alarm while validating this
    same fix**: `lib_tree_matches`'s own `_file_hashes` excluded only
    `__pycache__`/`.pyc`/`.pyo`, not the FULL set of build/cache
    directory names a copytree's own `ignore` callback excludes
    (`.git`, `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `build`, `dist`) -- so
    comparing a canonical tree that still carries a local `.ruff_cache`
    (an ordinary dev artifact) against its own freshly-copied sibling
    (which correctly omits it) reported a false mismatch on the REAL
    repo tree, even though every earlier synthetic test passed (none of
    them had a real `.ruff_cache` present). Fixed `_file_hashes` (both
    copies) to exclude the same ignore-list, confirmed against the real
    repo tree afterward with no false SKIP.
  - Added 2 regression tests (`test_materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs_
    refuses_a_non_directory_sibling`,
    `test_materialize_nested_uv_editable_refs_refuses_stale_mismatched_
    content`) to `test_materialize_main.py`. Re-validated: `test_
    materialize_main.py` 74 passed; `test_sync_vendored_libs.py` (uses
    the same `lib_tree_matches`) unaffected, still passing;
    `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` 10 passed; worktree-manager's
    own full suite 1548 passed, 4 skipped; real-repo materialize
    round-trip and all guards green.
  - **Fourth review round found 4 more real findings** -- all fallout
    from CI/tooling/hooks that still hardcoded the removed local
    `plugins/agent-bridge/libs/ssh-manager`/`plugins/agent-codespaces/
    libs/agent-procutil` paths, missed because those surfaces sit
    outside the plugin test suites and the tooling's own unit tests:
    - CI's "Test shared SSH proxy contracts" smoke step (in the `full`
      per-plugin matrix job, distinct from the "checks" job's canonical-
      lib step) still set `PYTHONPATH=plugins/agent-bridge/libs/
      ssh-manager/src` -- updated to the canonical `libs/ssh-manager/src`
      + `libs/agent-procutil/src` (ssh-manager's own dependency).
    - `tools/nested_uv_editable_ref.py` (this session's own new module)
      was missing from `test_promote_release.py`/`test_rollback_
      release.py`'s `_REQUIRED_TOOLS` isolated-bundle lists -- their
      synthetic scratch repos only worked because the real repo's
      `tools/` directory leaked onto `sys.path` via this test module's
      own import-time `sys.path.insert`. Added it to both lists, and
      added a genuinely isolated subprocess-based test
      (`test_required_tools_bundle_is_self_contained`) with an explicit
      minimal `PYTHONPATH` that would have caught this bundle gap
      directly (verified: reproduced the exact `ModuleNotFoundError`
      manually before the fix).
    - `agent-codespaces`'s `emit_codespace_map.py` sessionStart hook
      hardcoded `payload/libs/agent-procutil/src` with no fallback --
      broken in a dev checkout (no local copy there anymore), though
      still correct for a real materialized release (which DOES get a
      local copy at promotion time). Added `_agent_procutil_src()`, a
      two-tier resolver (materialized payload copy, else canonical
      repo-root `libs/agent-procutil/src`) mirroring the same pattern
      used everywhere else in this effort; covered both layouts with new
      tests.
  - Re-validated: `test_materialize_main.py` 74 passed;
    `test_promote_release.py`/`test_rollback_release.py` 25 passed;
    `agent-codespaces`'s full suite (including 2 new tests) fully green;
    all guards still green.
- **Next up**: `single-instance-lease` (5 consumers) -- check its own
  `pyproject.toml` dependencies FIRST this time, per the ordering lesson
  above, before assuming the effort's original Plan ordering is still
  safe as written. **Also sweep for hardcoded plugin-local paths to the
  just-converted lib(s) across CI workflows, tooling test bundles, and
  session hooks/scripts** -- this round's 4 findings were ALL this same
  class of gap, missed because they sit outside the plugin test suites
  the earlier recipe steps already cover. **Done** -- see the
  2026-09-28 "Phase 1: converted `single-instance-lease`" entry below
  (PR #4403).

### 2026-09-28 — Fifth review round: absolute-path filtering bug in the shared hash comparison helper

- **Real bug in the `_file_hashes` fix from the previous round**: the
  ignored-directory-name check (`ignored_dirs & set(f.parts)`) operated
  on each file's FULL path, not the path relative to the tree being
  hashed -- so a checkout merely *located* under an ancestor directory
  happening to share a name with one of the ignored patterns (`build`,
  `dist`, `.git`, etc.) would have every single file's `.parts` match
  that ancestor, silently emptying `_file_hashes`' whole result and
  making ANY two trees compare as falsely equal (`lib_tree_matches`
  returning `True` for genuinely different content) -- a real
  correctness gap for the exact validation this round's own earlier fix
  was built to provide. Fixed by scoping the check to
  `f.relative_to(root).parts` in both `tools/uv_editable_ref.py` and the
  trusted `_trusted_pointer_materializer.py` copy.
- Added a regression test
  (`test_lib_tree_matches_ignores_only_relative_build_dir_names`) that
  places the comparison itself under a `build/` ancestor directory and
  confirms two genuinely different trees still compare as different
  (would have failed before the fix), while a real `build/` SUBDIRECTORY
  *inside* a tree is still correctly ignored.
- Re-validated: `test_uv_editable_ref.py`/`test_materialize_main.py` 103
  passed; worktree-manager's own full suite 1548 passed, 4 skipped;
  real-repo materialize round-trip and all other guards still green.
- **Fifth review round otherwise reported the prior 9 findings as
  already resolved** (this specific finding was the only genuinely new
  one) -- awaiting the next round to confirm zero remaining findings.

### 2026-09-28 — PR #4372 merged out-of-band before the fifth-round fix landed; follow-up PR #4383

- **PR #4372 merged (by the repo owner, ~2 minutes after the fifth
  review round's comment) BEFORE the round-5 `_file_hashes` fix above was
  pushed** -- the fix commit's own timestamp (00:21:54 local) postdates
  the merge (00:19:35 local per the PR's `merged_at`). The absolute-path
  filtering bug therefore landed on `dev` unfixed via #4372's merge.
- Opened a small follow-up PR (**#4383**) cherry-picking just that one
  fix commit cleanly onto fresh `dev` (clean cherry-pick, no conflicts).
- **Review found 1 more real finding**: the new regression test only
  exercised `tools/uv_editable_ref.py`'s (canonical) `lib_tree_matches`,
  never the trusted `_trusted_pointer_materializer.py` copy's own
  `_lib_tree_matches` -- a future one-line drift in the trusted path
  could reintroduce the false-equality bug while the existing test stays
  green. Added a direct parity test
  (`test_lib_tree_matches_parity_ignores_only_relative_build_dir_names`)
  exercising BOTH implementations side-by-side against the same
  ancestor-directory scenario (initially had a test-construction bug of
  its own -- reused `_canonical_lib`'s lib-name-derived package dir name
  for both trees being compared, so the two lib DIRECTORIES had
  different relative paths regardless of the fix; rewrote to give both
  trees the same internal `src/zdd/` shape at different sibling
  locations, confirmed it now correctly fails without the fix and passes
  with it).
- Re-validated: `test_trusted_materializer_parity.py` 11 passed;
  worktree-manager's own full suite 1550 passed, 4 skipped (both counts
  +2 from the two new tests added across this session's fixes).

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `single-instance-lease` (5 consumers, PR #4403)

- Converted all 5 real consumers (`agent-vault`, `agent-worktrees`,
  `agent-dispatch`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-bridge`) from a per-plugin
  `src-passthrough` copy to a `uv`-editable canonical reference, per the
  now-standard recipe. `single-instance-lease` has no dependency on
  another vendored lib (pure stdlib), so no early-conversion ordering
  caveat applied here.
- Added `libs/single-instance-lease/tests/conftest.py` and wired the
  canonical suite into CI's "Canonical shared-library tests" step (it is
  no longer collected by any consumer's own plugin suite once fully
  converted).
- **Discovered and confirmed a pre-existing, environment-dependent test
  flake unrelated to this conversion**: `agent-bridge`'s
  `test_ensure_boots_when_down_then_healthy` hangs because
  `service_process_cli.py`'s `_INSTALL_DIR` is computed once at module
  *import* time, before the test suite's `autouse` isolation fixture sets
  `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONFIG_DIR` -- so the test reads this machine's real, live
  `~/.agent-bridge` daemon state instead of an isolated tmp dir.
  Reproduced identically on unmodified `dev` via `git stash`/`git stash
  pop` before concluding it was pre-existing (never assumed). Deselected
  in this PR's validation run; filed as tracked issue **#4404** rather
  than fixed here (out of scope -- touches daemon lifecycle code, not
  vendor-pointer plumbing).
- **First review round** flagged one real finding: the canonical
  `libs/single-instance-lease/README.md`'s "Vendoring" section still
  described the old per-plugin-copy-only model, not the current
  dev-uv-editable / release-time-materialization split. Fixed by
  rewriting that section to name both regimes explicitly (matches the
  reviewer's ask; the three prior converted libs' READMEs carry the same
  stale wording and likely warrant the same fix in a future pass, but
  that's outside this PR's diff).
- Non-editable install probe and `materialize_main.py` round-trip both
  confirmed clean, as with the prior 3 conversions.

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `config-migrate` (5 consumers)

- Converted all 5 real consumers (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-containers`,
  `agent-logger`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`) from a per-plugin
  `src-passthrough` copy to a `uv`-editable canonical reference.
  `config-migrate`'s own `pyproject.toml` has no dependency on another
  vendored lib (only `pyyaml`), so no early-conversion ordering caveat
  applied.
- **Sweep for hardcoded plugin-local paths (recipe step 9) found two real
  gaps, both already fixed, neither requiring a code change to install
  logic**:
  - `plugins/agent-worktrees/scripts/install.sh`'s config-migrate
    pre-install block only checks `$PLUGIN_DIR/libs/config-migrate` (no
    repo-root fallback, unlike `agent-containers`/`agent-logger`/
    `agent-codespaces`, which already had the fallback pattern from the
    `credential-relay` precedent). Confirmed this is **not a bug**: the
    block is already guarded by `if [[ -f ... ]]`, so in dev (no local
    copy) it silently no-ops and the main `uv pip install "$PLUGIN_DIR"`
    call picks up config-migrate transitively via the uv-editable
    pointer -- exactly how `single-instance-lease`/
    `work-coalescing-singleton`/`lazy-cli-dispatch` already work in this
    same script with zero special-casing. Only a real release
    (materialized copy present) exercises the explicit reinstall branch,
    unchanged. No fix needed; verified by inspection, not assumed.
  - `worktree-manager/tests/test_production_picker_transplant.py` used
    `config-migrate` as its worked example of "a still real-copy-vendored
    lib" (to prove a fallback path only fires when a local copy is
    genuinely absent) -- now stale since config-migrate itself just
    became uv-editable. Fixed by swapping the example to `plugin-resolve`
    (still a genuine real per-plugin copy in `agent-worktrees`), keeping
    the regression test's own docstring claim accurate. Re-ran
    `worktree-manager`'s full suite: 52/52 passed on the touched file.
- Added `libs/config-migrate/tests/conftest.py` and wired the canonical
  suite into CI's "Canonical shared-library tests" step.
- Proactively updated `libs/config-migrate/README.md` with a dev-vs-
  release vendoring note (learned from the prior leg's review round --
  did this up front rather than waiting for the reviewer to ask again).
- Non-editable install probe and `materialize_main.py` round-trip both
  confirmed clean.
- **Review round 1 caught a real HIGH-severity gap I missed**:
  `plugins/agent-worktrees/scripts/install.ps1`'s config-migrate
  pre-install block had no repo-root fallback (unlike its bash
  counterpart's other 3 consumers, which already had the fallback from
  the `credential-relay` precedent). `Invoke-VenvPackageInstall`'s bare-
  `pip` fallback path (used when `uv` fails/is absent) does not honor
  `[tool.uv.sources]`, so a dev checkout with no local copy would fail to
  resolve `agent-config-migrate` on that path. Fixed by mirroring
  `agent-codespaces`'s existing repo-root-fallback pattern; syntax-
  validated with PowerShell's own parser (no pwsh test harness available
  for a full functional run). Confirmed bash's `install.sh` needs no
  equivalent fix (`_ensure_uv || exit 1` guards every `deploy_package`
  call site, so `uv` -- which does honor `[tool.uv.sources]` -- is always
  present there).
  - **Discovered a broader latent gap while investigating**: the 3 libs
    already converted to `uv`-editable for `agent-worktrees`
    (`single-instance-lease`, `work-coalescing-singleton`,
    `lazy-cli-dispatch`) have **zero** equivalent pre-install handling in
    this same `install.ps1` -- they'd hit the identical bare-pip-fallback
    failure mode if a `uv` invocation ever transiently fails, even though
    `Ensure-Uv` normally guarantees `uv`'s presence. Filed as tracked
    issue **#4410** (scoped to also audit other plugins' Windows
    installers for the same already-converted-lib gap) rather than fixed
    speculatively here -- out of scope for this PR's specific finding.

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `dropin-registry` + `plugin-resolve` + `plugin-activation` (bundled)

- `plugin-activation` depends on `agent-dropin-registry`/`agent-plugin-resolve`
  (its own `pyproject.toml` `dependencies`), and EVERY one of its 7 real
  consumers (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-logger`,
  `agent-bridge`, `agent-machines`, `agent-codespaces`, `worktree-manager`)
  ALSO directly depends on both as real copies -- the exact ordering
  hazard this effort's own Plan flagged. Converted all 3 libs together, for
  the same 7 consumers, in one bundled PR (mirroring the earlier
  `ssh-manager` + `agent-procutil` precedent).
- `plugin-activation` was already `src-passthrough` (converted forward in
  PR #4004, before this effort's course-correction back to `uv`-editable) --
  `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable` handles a pointer-copy
  source exactly like a real copy, no special handling needed.
- **`dropin-registry` has 9 real consumers total, not 7** -- `agent-ssh`
  and `agent-index` also vendor it as a real copy but do NOT depend on
  `plugin-activation`, so they were correctly left un-converted (no
  ordering conflict forces their hand); a future dedicated `dropin-
  registry` leg should pick those 2 up. Re-confirmed `plugin-resolve`'s
  consumer count is exactly the same 7 (no similar miss there).
- **Canonical drift discovered for `plugin-resolve`** (not caused by this
  PR): the tool's full-tree byte comparison (`lib_tree_matches`, used to
  gate the destructive local-copy deletion) refused all 7 consumers --
  canonical had grown a `tests/conftest.py` (added in an earlier, unrelated
  PR #4088) and bumped its `setuptools`/`pytest` version floors plus 2 new
  test functions, none of which had ever been backported to any consumer's
  real copy. Confirmed via diff that `src/` itself was byte-identical
  everywhere (so no runtime-behavior risk) before syncing each copy to
  canonical and retrying the conversion -- this is exactly the kind of
  silent canonical-vs-copies drift `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`'s
  advisory reporting does NOT catch today (it only compares copies against
  each other, not against canonical, for anything except `src/`+version).
- **`customizing-copilot`'s `plugin-activation.py` follow-up, done alongside
  this conversion as planned**: it has no `pyproject.toml` of its own (never
  consumes the lib via `[tool.uv.sources]`), so `--uv-editable` doesn't
  apply to it directly. Deleted its local `src-passthrough` pointer copy
  and rewrote `_resolve_state_py()` to always resolve `state.py` straight to
  the monorepo's own canonical path -- the same "no local copy, resolve to
  canonical" principle, just via a bespoke path computation instead of a
  `[tool.uv.sources]` entry (the effort's own forward-looking note assumed
  a consumer `pyproject.toml` existed to parse; it doesn't, so the simpler
  direct-canonical-resolution fix was used instead).
- **Test-suite regressions found and fixed, all in test infrastructure, none
  in runtime code**:
  - `agent-logger`'s `tests/test_install_binstub.py::
    test_installers_install_plugin_activation_after_its_own_transitive_deps`
    started raising `KeyError: 'plugin-activation'` -- its own
    `_vendored_path_dependencies()` regex only matched the real-copy
    `path = "libs/<dir>"` form, never the `uv`-editable
    `path = "../../libs/<dir>", editable = true` form, so converted libs
    silently vanished from its own "which libs need this check" discovery.
    `agent-logger`'s actual `install.sh`/`install.ps1` were ALREADY correct
    (both already had proper marketplace-vs-dev-checkout fallback blocks
    for all 4 libs, built in an earlier, unrelated pass) -- only the test's
    own regex needed fixing to also match the new pointer form.
  - `worktree-manager/src/worktree_manager/agent_worktrees_runtime.py`'s
    `ensure_engine_runtime()` hardcodes the specific list of `agent-
    worktrees` libs it backfills onto `sys.path` for compatibility-layer
    imports (`plugin-resolve`, `config-migrate`, `single-instance-lease`,
    `lazy-cli-dispatch`) -- missing `work-coalescing-singleton` (converted
    in an EARLIER, unrelated leg, PR #4331, and apparently never added
    here) plus this leg's own `dropin-registry`/`plugin-activation`. Added
    all 3. This is a genuine functional gap (not just a test staleness
    issue): without it, `worktree_manager`'s compatibility imports of
    `agent_worktrees` modules that transitively import these libs would
    `ModuleNotFoundError` in a dev checkout. Also rewrote
    `worktree-manager/tests/test_production_picker_transplant.py`'s
    repeatedly-stale "still real-copy-vendored lib" worked example (this
    is now the SECOND time it needed fixing, having been swapped from
    `config-migrate` to `plugin-resolve` in the prior PR, now stale again
    since plugin-resolve just converted too) -- reframed the comment to
    explain the fixture is deliberately synthetic and names a lib from
    `ensure_engine_runtime()`'s own checked list regardless of that lib's
    real, live conversion status, so it never goes stale again.
- **Confirmed pre-existing, unrelated failures/flakes via `git stash`/
  `git stash pop` against unmodified `dev`** (none caused by this PR):
  - `customizing-copilot`'s
    `test_shipped_projection_budgets.py::...[agent-worktrees]` --
    `head-claim-fallback.instructions.md` (5519 bytes) exceeded the 4 KiB
    instruction-projection template budget, introduced by an unrelated
    merged PR (#4406). Filed as tracked issue #4416, then **fixed directly
    in this same PR** (rather than left tracked-only) once it became clear
    it would fail CI's default (non-deselecting) `customizing-copilot` job
    the moment this PR touched that plugin: trimmed the file from 5519 to
    3180 bytes, all content preserved (just tightened prose), bringing the
    rendered projection to 4088 bytes -- under the 4096-byte budget with 8
    bytes to spare. Closed #4416 once verified. Full `agent-worktrees` +
    `customizing-copilot` suites re-confirmed green afterward, with no
    deselect needed anymore.
  - `agent-dispatch`'s full-suite run intermittently exceeds
    `run-plugin-tests.py`'s 300s default per-sub-suite wall-clock budget
    (hits a DIFFERENT specific test each retry, and every individually-
    isolated test/file passes instantly) -- this is genuine suite-duration
    growth under this sandbox's current CPU constraints, not a hang;
    passed cleanly (3523 passed) with `--timeout 550 --plugin-timeout 580`.
    Not filed as a tracked issue (an environment/resource characteristic,
    not a code defect) but worth remembering for future legs' validation.
- Proactively added dev-vs-release vendoring notes to all 3 libs'
  READMEs up front (continuing the practice started last leg).
- Non-editable install probe and `materialize_main.py` round-trip both
  confirmed clean for all 3 libs (including the nested-dependency
  materialize case: `plugin-activation`'s own promoted `pyproject.toml`
  correctly loses `editable = true` on its internal `dropin-registry`/
  `plugin-resolve` references, exactly as `ssh-manager`'s precedent
  established for `agent-procutil`).
- **Review round 2 caught 3 more real findings, all in this same
  Windows-installer-fallback class the effort's own recipe now flags on
  every leg**:
  - `agent-worktrees/scripts/install.ps1`'s `plugin-resolve` block still
    had no repo-root fallback (round 1 only fixed `config-migrate`'s), and
    `dropin-registry`/`plugin-activation` had NO blocks at all. Added the
    fallback plus two new blocks, `plugin-activation` last (module-load-
    time import ordering, mirroring `agent-logger`'s own guard).
  - `agent-dispatch/scripts/install.ps1`: same gap for `dropin-registry`,
    `plugin-resolve`, `plugin-activation` -- and, discovered while fixing
    it, `single-instance-lease` from an EARLIER, unrelated leg (#4403) had
    the identical gap the whole time, never caught until this round. Added
    a single parameterized preinstall loop covering all 4 (using the
    script's own existing `Resolve-VendoredLib` 4-tier fallback helper,
    already used for `zdd`), rather than four near-duplicate blocks.
  - `agent-machines/scripts/init.sh` AND `init.ps1`: same gap for
    `dropin-registry`/`plugin-resolve`/`plugin-activation` in BOTH POSIX
    and Windows installers (this script's bash side genuinely does fall
    back to bare `python -m pip`, unlike `agent-worktrees`'s bash, which
    fully requires `uv` -- confirmed by inspection, not assumed). Added
    matching preinstall blocks to both.
  - **A 4th finding was a real bug I introduced, not a missed gap**:
    `customizing-copilot`'s `installing-plugins/scripts/
    plugin-activation.py` runs from the INSTALLED marketplace payload in a
    real release, where `plugin_root.parent.parent` is the Copilot
    installation directory, not this repository -- my round-1 rewrite of
    `_resolve_state_py()` (to always resolve straight to a monorepo-
    relative canonical path) was simply WRONG for that case; it would
    resolve to a nonexistent path and break every `inspect`/`remove`
    command post-release. Root cause: `materialize_main.py` discovers
    `VENDOR_POINTER.json` pointer copies by directly scanning
    `plugins/*/libs/<lib>/`, independent of any consuming
    `pyproject.toml` -- so `customizing-copilot`'s ORIGINAL `src-
    passthrough` pointer copy was already release-materializable and
    correct all along. **Reverted both the pointer-copy deletion and the
    script rewrite back to their pre-PR state** rather than re-inventing
    a fix -- `customizing-copilot` simply isn't a `uv`-editable-
    convertible consumer (no `pyproject.toml` of its own) and the
    effort's own forward-looking Plan note (written before this was
    fully investigated) was wrong to assume otherwise. Corrected
    `libs/plugin-activation/README.md`'s wording to match.
  - The changefile-mismatch finding was stale (already fixed one commit
    earlier, before this review round ran) -- confirmed via `git diff
    origin/dev --stat` and replied with that evidence rather than
    re-fixing.
  - Re-validated: `agent-machines` (665 passed), `agent-dispatch` (3523
    passed), `agent-worktrees` (5882 passed), `customizing-copilot` (274
    passed) all green; all 3 new/changed `.ps1`/`.sh` scripts syntax-
    validated with PowerShell's own parser / `bash -n`.
  - **Lesson for the next lib conversion**: audit EVERY consumer's actual
    installer (not just the specific plugin the reviewer happens to flag
    first) for this exact non-uv-pip-fallback gap, for EVERY lib the
    consumer has ever converted (not just the one currently being
    converted) -- this class of finding has now recurred across 3
    consecutive PRs in this effort (#4409, and twice within #4420) and is
    clearly the single most-missed step in the whole recipe.
- **Review round 3 asked for test coverage on all 3 new/changed Windows
  installer fallback blocks** (none of the existing installer guards
  exercised these new branches): added `test_installer_uv_editable_lib_
  fallback.py` (`agent-worktrees`, static + pwsh-execution guards for the
  plugin-resolve/dropin-registry/plugin-activation blocks plus an
  ordering check), `test_installer_uv_editable_lib_preinstall.py`
  (`agent-dispatch`, pwsh-execution guard for the 4-lib parameterized
  loop, both local-copy and repo-root-canonical-fallback cases, ordering
  asserted), and both `test_installer_uv_editable_lib_preinstall_ps1.py`
  + `_sh.py` (`agent-machines`, covering both the `uv` path and the
  bare-pip fallback path for both scripts). All new tests hit real
  `pwsh`/`bash` execution (never static-only), following the precedent
  already established for `config-migrate`'s own guard in PR #4409.
  Debugging notes worth carrying forward: a stub function invoked via
  `& $VenvPython ...` (PowerShell) does NOT reset `$LASTEXITCODE`, and an
  unset `$LASTEXITCODE` compares `-ne 0` as **true** (`$null -ne 0` is
  `$true`) -- a stub must explicitly set `$global:LASTEXITCODE = 0` or
  the surrounding script's own error-check spuriously fires; and each
  script's own exact positional argument order for its `uv pip install`/
  `pip install` call differs (double-check with the real source, don't
  assume the same index works across scripts). Re-validated: full
  `agent-worktrees` + `agent-machines` (673 passed) and `agent-dispatch`
  (3525 passed) suites green with the new tests included.

### 2026-09-28 — Concrete motivating case for Phase 2: `agent-worktrees`'s bespoke resolver drifted and broke

- While diagnosing an unrelated Worktree Manager launch failure ("failed
  to locate pyvenv.cfg"), root-caused and fixed a real production bug in
  `agent-worktrees`'s launcher scripts (`worktree-manager/bin/
  launch-session.ps1`/`.sh`): `agent_worktrees resolve` bakes the running
  interpreter's own path into the resolved launch plan as a literal
  `-RuntimePython`/`--runtime-python` argument, before the launcher's own
  background stage-update swaps the runtime venv slot. If a runtime
  update lands in between, the baked path can point at a slot the update
  has already pruned, so the pane launch fails outright. Fixed by
  re-patching that argument to the freshly-refreshed interpreter path
  right after the update-apply step (mirroring the pre-existing
  `#stale-venv` re-resolve idiom already used elsewhere in the same
  scripts). Filed and fixed upstream: issue #4432, PR #4428 (both merged).
- This is exactly the class of drift this effort's Phase 2 (canonical-
  reference form for the shared installer engine) exists to close:
  `agent-worktrees` ships a **bespoke** resolver/installer variant
  (`plugins/agent-worktrees/scripts/versioned_runtime.py`'s sibling
  concept, hand-grown rather than vendored from `libs/versioned-runtime/`
  -- see `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py`'s explicit `RESOLVER_BESPOKE =
  {"agent-worktrees"}` exclusion), so it sits outside the byte-identity
  drift-check this effort's sibling (`vendored-installer-engine`)
  enforces for every other plugin. A live-reference canonical-installer-
  engine form (this effort's Phase 2 goal) would have made this bug
  either structurally impossible (the stale-argument fix lives in one
  place, inherited everywhere) or immediately visible as a drift-check
  failure the moment `agent-worktrees` diverged from the shared logic --
  instead it shipped silently for some period as a real, user-facing
  launch failure.
- `worktree-manager`'s own out-of-plugin `self_install`/`self_update`
  (`worktree-manager/src/worktree_manager/self_install.py`) was checked
  for the same failure class and does **not** have it: it never prunes
  old `versions/<ver>/` slots at all (only cleans its own just-created
  slot on a failed install, plus one-time legacy-artifact migration), so
  there is no old-slot deletion to race against an in-flight launch.
  Different tradeoff, same root cause it avoids only by omission (old
  slots currently accumulate unbounded rather than ever racing) -- noted
  here in case Phase 2's canonical-reference engine ends up giving
  `worktree-manager` real slot GC for the first time, at which point this
  exact race class becomes newly possible there too and should be
  designed against from the start rather than rediscovered.
- No code change proposed here; this is evidence for scheduling/
  prioritizing Phase 2, not a mechanism decision -- left for this
  effort's driver per its own coordination note above.

### 2026-09-28 — Phase 1: converted `agent-procutil`'s remaining 7 consumers (PR #4465)

- Converted `agent-vault`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-index`, `agent-mcp`,
  `agent-logger`, `agent-machines`, and `worktree-manager` from real
  copies to `uv`-editable canonical references. Combined with the 4
  consumers already converted alongside `ssh-manager` earlier this
  effort, **11 of 12 `agent-procutil` consumers are now converted**.
- **`agent-worktrees` deliberately excluded, discovered mid-leg via a
  rebase conflict**: this leg's own working branch had already converted
  `agent-worktrees` too (matching the "8 remaining, not 7" re-derivation
  below), but rebasing onto a moved `origin/dev` conflicted on
  `agent-worktrees/pyproject.toml` against PR #4447 ("add graceful
  status-monitor cutover"), which explicitly reverted `plugin-resolve`/
  `dropin-registry`/`plugin-activation` from `uv`-editable BACK to real
  local copies and added `zdd` as a new real-copy dependency too --
  commit message: "make the shipped dependency copies part of the
  plugin build surface." This is a deliberate, human-authored design
  decision for `agent-worktrees` specifically (its new cutover feature
  apparently needs a physically self-contained dependency snapshot, not
  a live dev-checkout reference) -- converting `agent-procutil` for this
  one consumer would have silently fought that decision. Dropped
  `agent-worktrees` entirely from this PR's scope; its `agent-procutil`
  stays the real local copy it already was. **This is now the 2nd
  concrete piece of evidence for this effort's own Phase 2 (a canonical-
  reference form for the installer engine itself)** -- see the prior
  entry above about the same plugin's bespoke resolver drifting; PR
  #4447's justified-but-blunt "just vendor real copies again" reaction
  is exactly the kind of workaround Phase 2 exists to make unnecessary.
- **Did not trust the inherited "7 remaining" count**: the previous
  handoff's own consumer tally missed `agent-dispatch` (still a real
  copy) -- re-derived the consumer set from a fresh anchored grep per the
  recipe's own step 1 and found 8 (including `agent-worktrees`, since
  discovered above to need exclusion), not 7. Converted 7 of those 8 in
  this PR.
- `src/` was byte-identical across all 7 copies; only `tests/conftest.py`
  had drifted (canonical had it, the copies didn't) -- backported before
  converting, per the established recipe.
- **New instance of the recurring non-uv-pip-fallback finding**, this
  time missed on the FIRST pass and only caught by 3 separate reviewer
  findings across 3 more review rounds -- audit every consumer's
  install script BEFORE claiming done, not just the ones already known
  to have a curated per-lib loop:
  - `agent-machines`' `init.sh`/`init.ps1` preinstall loop (added for
    `dropin-registry`/`plugin-resolve`/`plugin-activation` in PR #4420)
    didn't cover `agent-procutil` -- added it to the loop (before
    `plugin-activation`, matching the loop's own ordering comment) and
    updated both guard tests to assert 4 libs instead of 3.
  - `agent-dispatch`'s `install.ps1` preinstall loop (same shape) also
    didn't cover `agent-procutil` -- same fix, same test update (this
    was caught only by an explicit reviewer finding, not by this leg's
    own first-pass audit, which incorrectly assumed checking `install.sh`
    was sufficient without separately checking `install.ps1`).
  - `agent-index` preinstalls only `zdd` in both `install.sh` and
    `install.ps1`, at TWO call sites each (service-runtime venv +
    durable-engine-runtime venv) -- `agent-procutil` is the FIRST
    `uv`-editable lib this plugin has ever had (its other 3 libs are
    still real copies), so this gap had never been exercised before.
    Added a matching preinstall block at all 4 call sites. No existing
    test covered this pattern for `agent-index` at all -- added new
    `test_installer_uv_editable_lib_preinstall_sh.py`/`_ps1.py` (24 new
    test cases: local-copy resolution, canonical fallback, no-op, x2
    runtimes x2 uv/non-uv paths).
  - `agent-worktrees`' `install.ps1` `Deploy-Package` also lacked an
    `agent-procutil` preinstall block when this was originally found --
    moot once `agent-worktrees` was excluded above (its `install.sh`
    counterpart structurally requires `uv` with no fallback branch at
    all, confirmed via a fresh `uv`-only probe install).
  - `agent-vault`/`agent-mcp` had the SAME systemic gap for their OTHER
    already-converted libs (tracked under #3905/#4410, confirmed
    pre-existing by inspection, not assumed) -- fixed later in this same
    leg: a preinstall loop was added to all 4 scripts (`agent-vault`
    `install.sh`/`install.ps1`, `agent-mcp` `init.sh`/`init.ps1`)
    covering every escaping `[tool.uv.sources]` dependency, not just
    `agent-procutil`, with 16 new guard-test cases. Verified:
    `agent-vault` (251 passed, 6 skipped) and `agent-mcp` (359 passed,
    1 skipped) full suites both green afterward.
  - `libs/payload-invocation/tests/test_generate.py` ALSO hardcoded
    `payload/libs/agent-procutil/src` at 5 call sites, for both the
    `agent-machines` AND `agent-worktrees` fixtures it copies from the
    real repo tree -- caught by the automated reviewer's own CI-failure
    watchdog auto-remediation commit (4 of 5 sites) plus a follow-up
    reviewer finding for the 5th (`agent-worktrees`'s Windows-only
    helper). Left this fix in place even after excluding `agent-worktrees`
    from conversion -- harmless (local-copy-first resolver behaves
    identically when a real local copy always exists) and more robust
    regardless.
- **New finding, not previously seen for this effort**: `agent-index`'s
  `tests/test_runtime_gate.py` hardcoded
  `PLUGIN / "libs" / "agent-procutil" / "src"` into a fake-runtime
  `PYTHONPATH` at 3 call sites -- a test-only hardcoded path to the
  plugin's own now-deleted local copy. Confirmed via a fresh clean rerun
  that the observed 3 real test failures (not the separate, pre-existing
  `[LIMIT] temporary-storage limit exceeded` sub-suite-splitting
  artifact, confirmed unrelated by rerunning with a larger sub-suite
  batch to completion: 633 passed, 2 skipped) disappeared once fixed.
  Added a `_procutil_src()` resolver (local-copy-then-canonical-fallback,
  mirroring the install scripts' own pattern) rather than hardcoding the
  canonical path directly, so it stays correct if a local copy is ever
  reintroduced. **Lesson for the next lib conversion**: grep every
  consumer's `tests/` directory for a hardcoded `libs/<lib>` path, not
  just install scripts (recipe step 16 already said "beyond install
  scripts and tests" -- this is the first time a *test* itself, not
  runtime code, was the hit).
- **Another new finding**: `agent-index`'s installation-cell mechanism
  (`cell-runtime.py`'s `_ensure_snapshot`/`_copy_payload`) snapshots ONLY
  what's physically present under the plugin's own tree -- with
  `agent-procutil` no longer a real local copy, the snapshot silently
  lacked it, and `_build_runtime` unconditionally installed from
  `snapshot_root/libs/agent-procutil`. Added
  `_backfill_canonical_vendored_libs()` (copies the canonical lib into
  the snapshot when the payload didn't have it) AND
  `_rewrite_uv_source_to_local()` (a self-contained miniature of
  `materialize_main.py`'s own promotion-time rewrite -- this runtime
  script must stay `tools/`-independent since a real release payload
  doesn't ship `tools/`), since the snapshotted `pyproject.toml`'s own
  `../../libs/agent-procutil` source entry escapes the snapshot root and
  never resolves from there either. Widened `cell-runtime.py`'s
  module-size-baseline entry three times across this leg (5145 -> 5161
  -> 5193 -> 5211, the last for round 9's symlink-reject fix) -- the
  file was already at its grandfathered ceiling before this leg touched
  it at all.
- Also updated `libs/agent-procutil/README.md` § Vendoring and its
  module docstring -- both still described the pre-this-leg "every
  plugin carries a local copy" state, caught by reviewer inspection
  (mirrors `single-instance-lease`'s own README wording from an earlier
  leg).
- Re-validated: fresh `uv venv` + `uv pip install --no-cache` probes for
  all 7 consumers resolve `agent_procutil.__file__` to canonical;
  `materialize_main.py --dest <tmp>` round-trips byte-identical with
  `editable = true` correctly stripped. Full suites green: `agent-vault`
  (249 passed), `agent-dispatch` (806 passed), `agent-mcp` (359 passed),
  `agent-logger`, `agent-machines`, `agent-index` (633 passed, 2 skipped)
  all green; `worktree-manager`'s own full suite (1455 passed, 4
  skipped) and its version-specific tests (19 passed) also green (its
  `agent-procutil` dependency annotation had also gone stale, describing
  the pre-conversion "vendored per plugin" state -- fixed alongside).
  **Note (superseded later in this same leg, split-PR round 11):** an
  earlier round of this leg hand-bumped `pyproject.toml`/`__init__.py`'s
  version surfaces directly -- that hand-edit was reverted once the
  split PR #4514 taught the promotion pipeline to detect and bump
  standalone consumers itself; contributors never hand-edit these
  generated versions (CONTRIBUTING.md), and the pending changefile alone
  now correctly produces the bump at promotion time.
- **Investigated and did NOT reproduce** an external, unverified report
  (relayed via this session's inherited handoff) that PR #4420 broke
  `check-vendored-libs-sync.py` repo-wide for `agent-dispatch`: a fresh
  `git reset --hard origin/dev` + a clean run of the check both came
  back OK, and `plugins/agent-dispatch/libs/{dropin-registry,plugin-
  resolve,plugin-activation}` are correctly absent (not empty/broken).
  Most likely a rebase-conflict artifact local to the reporting agent's
  own worktree/branch, not a repo-wide regression -- no further action
  taken since it wasn't reproducible from a clean checkout.
- **Not yet done**: `agent-worktrees`' `agent-procutil` (excluded above,
  pending Phase 2 or a fresh maintainer call on the cutover-vs-canonical-
  reference tradeoff); `zdd` (not yet converted for ANY consumer, and now
  `agent-worktrees` has a NEW real-copy dependency on it too, per PR
  #4447 -- re-check `zdd`'s consumer count before starting that
  conversion, it may have grown); `session-liveness-probe`/
  `venue-copilot` still need canonical-promotion first. Then retire
  `src-passthrough` (once nothing uses it -- `plugin-activation`'s
  `customizing-copilot` copy stays `src-passthrough` forever, see
  earlier entry). Then Phase 2/3.

### 2026-09-29 — Closing out the #4465/#4514 split-PR leg

- `tools/check-version-bump.py`'s consumer-discovery generalization and
  `tools/accumulate_bumps.py`/`tools/promote_release.py`'s new
  standalone-consumer bump/promotion support were split into their own
  standalone PR (#4514) partway through review, since they were
  justified on their own merits independent of the agent-procutil
  conversion and the split cut #4465's own review-round churn. #4514
  itself went 12 further rounds -- almost entirely legitimate,
  progressively narrower TOML-parsing edge cases in the new standalone-
  consumer version read/write path (quotes, inline comments,
  indentation, quoted table names), until the review's own round-12
  finding named the actual structural gap: `apply()`'s caller silently
  consumed a changefile even when the computed bump was never actually
  written. `promote_release.py` now aborts with a clear error whenever
  that happens, closing the whole class of future format edge cases at
  once rather than chasing each one individually. #4514 merged first,
  #4465 was rebased onto the result (dropping its own now-redundant
  duplicate check-version-bump.py hunks) and merged after one further
  round (a hand-edited worktree-manager version bump, made
  unnecessary and actively harmful by #4514's own new promotion support,
  had to be reverted). Both merges used the maintainer's documented
  admin-role-scoped bypass path (CONTRIBUTING.md's own normal mechanism
  for the maintainer's own PRs, not an emergency override) after the
  automated `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`'s own review approved both.
- **Facility-process note, not part of this effort's own scope:** a
  concurrent, uncoordinated peer session was found independently
  reworking the same PR mid-leg (a stray worktree from an earlier,
  un-handed-off attempt) -- it stood down once contacted. Separately,
  this leg's own predecessor had been posting `@copilot review` PR
  comments across earlier rounds, which the repo's own
  CONTRIBUTING.md/AGENTS.md ban (it misroutes to the GitHub Cloud coding
  agent instead of nudging the review bot) -- the operator disabled
  Cloud Agents org-wide because of it mid-session, and the automated
  reviewer stopped firing repo-wide for roughly two hours until it
  recovered on its own; this leg switched to plain pushes (which already
  trigger a fresh review pass) for the remainder.

### 2026-09-29 — Phase 1: converted `zdd`'s in-scope consumers (9 converted, `agent-worktrees` excluded)

- Re-derived the consumer set from a fresh `libs/zdd` grep before
  touching anything. Current `pyproject.toml` consumers were:
  `agent-ssh`, `agent-vault`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-containers`,
  `agent-index`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-codespaces`,
  `agent-worktrees`, and `worktree-manager` -- **10 total**, not the
  inherited 9. `agent-worktrees` stayed deliberately out of scope per PR
  #4447's explicit "make the shipped dependency copies part of the plugin
  build surface" decision, so this leg converted the other 9.
- `python3 tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --check` still reported zdd as
  "in sync" because it only guards `src/`; the first actual
  `--uv-editable agent-vault zdd` conversion refusal exposed the REAL
  full-tree drift this recipe warns about:
  - stale `README.md`/`pyproject.toml` in every real zdd copy,
  - missing canonical `tests/` in most copies (and missing
    `test_diagnostics.py` in the few copies that did vendor tests),
  - stray `build/` / `*.egg-info` cruft in a couple of consumers.
  Backfilled canonical `README.md`/`pyproject.toml`/`tests/` and removed
  the build cruft for the **9 in-scope consumers only**, then re-ran the
  conversion. `agent-worktrees`'s zdd copy was intentionally left
  untouched despite carrying the same drift.
- Converted these 9 consumers from real copies to `uv`-editable canonical
  references:
  `agent-vault`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-index`,
  `agent-dispatch`, `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`,
  `agent-bridge`, and `worktree-manager`.
- Install-script audit findings/fixes:
  - `agent-ssh`'s non-uv pip fallback still hardcoded
    `"$PLUGIN_DIR/libs/zdd"` / `Join-Path $PluginDir 'libs\zdd'`, unlike
    its already-generic ssh-manager/agent-procutil resolvers. Added the
    shared zdd resolver on both shell variants and extended the fallback
    guard tests.
  - `agent-containers`' `init.sh`/`init.ps1` preinstalled only
    `credential-relay` + `config-migrate`; once zdd became `uv`-editable,
    the installer needed the same explicit preinstall for it too. Added
    the zdd source fallback + guarded `agent-zdd` install to both
    scripts, with dependency-contract assertions.
  - `agent-codespaces` had the same omission in both `install.sh` and
    `install.ps1` (`ssh-manager`/`credential-relay`/`config-migrate`
    only). Added `zdd` to both editable-dev and non-editable install
    paths, with matching guard assertions.
  - `agent-vault`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-index`, `agent-mcp`, and
    `agent-bridge` already had valid zdd coverage; no install-script
    changes were needed there.
- `agent-index`'s installation-cell zdd handling was **not actually
  generic yet**, despite the prior leg's assumption: its snapshot backfill
  still hardcoded only `agent-procutil`, and `_payload_routing_module()`
  assumed a payload-local `libs/zdd/src` always existed. Generalized the
  snapshot backfill over every escaping `[tool.uv.sources]` entry, taught
  the routing import seam to fall back to repo-root canonical `libs/zdd`
  in a dev checkout, and extended `test_installation_cells.py`
  accordingly.
- Validation/verification completed:
  - full repo gate green:
    `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`,
    `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`,
    `check-install-contract.py`,
    `check-version-consistency.py`,
    `check-module-size.py`,
    `check-docs-consistency.py`,
    `check-changefile-presence.py --base origin/dev`
  - converted plugin suites green:
    `agent-vault`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-containers`,
    `agent-codespaces`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-dispatch`, `agent-index`
  - `worktree-manager` (no `run-plugin-tests.py` wrapper of its own):
    raw `test-supervisor -- worktree-manager/.venv-ci/bin/python -m pytest
    worktree-manager/tests` green, 1463 passed / 4 skipped
  - fresh non-editable probe install: `uv pip install --no-cache
    plugins/agent-vault` resolved `zdd.__file__` to canonical
    `libs/zdd/src/zdd/__init__.py`
  - quiet full-tree `materialize_main.py --dest ../materialized-zdd-check`
    round-trip verified `plugins/agent-vault` rewrites
    `agent-zdd = { path = "libs/zdd" }`, strips `editable = true`, and
    restores the real vendored `README.md`/`pyproject.toml`/`src/`/`tests/`
    tree for zdd in the materialized payload
- Also added `libs/zdd/README.md`'s missing Vendoring note so it no longer
  implies only the historical "every consumer ships a real local copy"
  shape.
- Validation surfaced one unrelated-but-real pre-existing regression in
  `libs/credential-relay`: `git_credential.py` resolved
  `powershell.exe` at import time, which broke `agent-containers`' own
  peer-governance refusal test once that suite re-imported the source in a
  stricter PATH-sanitized sandbox. Fixed by resolving PowerShell lazily at
  first use instead of at import time; this was required to get the
  mandated full consumer-suite validation green, not part of zdd's design.
- **Still not done after this leg:** `agent-worktrees`' zdd copy remains a
  real vendored copy by deliberate maintainer choice (same evidence trail
  toward Phase 2 as its earlier `agent-procutil` exclusion); `session-
  liveness-probe` and `venue-copilot` still need canonical promotion
  before any Phase 1 conversion; `src-passthrough` retirement and Phase
  2/3 remain outstanding.

### 2026-09-29 — Phase 1: promoted `session-liveness-probe` + `venue-copilot`, then converted all 5 consumers

- Re-derived the live consumer set from a fresh repo grep before touching
  anything. Real copies were exactly:
  - `session-liveness-probe`: `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`
  - `venue-copilot`: `agent-ssh`, `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`
  No extra `worktree-manager`/other plugin consumer surfaced.
- Re-verified copy agreement *before promotion* two ways:
  `sync-vendored-libs.py --check` still reported both libs as the only
  source (no top-level canonical), and direct `diff -qr` / per-file test
  hashes confirmed each lib's copies matched each other byte-for-byte
  (including `tests/`).
- **Found and fixed a real tool gap in the canonical-promotion step**:
  `sync-vendored-libs.py --restore-canonical`'s docstring claimed it could
  copy the shipped truth "up into `libs/<lib>`", but the implementation
  only worked when `libs/<lib>/` already existed *and* only synced `src/`
  plus the version string. That would have skipped both libs entirely here
  and would still have produced incomplete canonicals (dropping `README.md`,
  `tests/`, and any non-version `pyproject.toml` changes). Fixed
  `--restore-canonical` to create a missing canonical root and copy the
  whole filtered lib tree, plus a regression test for the missing-canonical
  case.
- **Found and fixed a second tool gap exposed immediately by the first real
  promotion attempt**: `tools/uv_editable_ref.py`'s `lib_tree_matches()`
  ignored `build/` but not `*.egg-info`, so perfectly-agreeing real copies
  that only differed by generated packaging metadata falsely looked drifted
  and blocked conversion. Taught the comparison to ignore `*.egg-info`
  artifacts too and added a regression test.
- Promoted both canonicals:
  `libs/session-liveness-probe/` and `libs/venue-copilot/`.
- Converted every real consumer directly to the `uv`-editable canonical-
  reference form:
  - `agent-containers`: `session-liveness-probe`, `venue-copilot`
  - `agent-codespaces`: `session-liveness-probe`, `venue-copilot`
  - `agent-ssh`: `venue-copilot`
- Install-script audit findings/fixes:
  - `agent-containers`' `init.sh` / `init.ps1` preinstalled
    `credential-relay`/`config-migrate`/`zdd` only. Added repo-root
    fallback + explicit `agent-venue-copilot` /
    `agent-session-liveness-probe` preinstalls to both variants.
  - `agent-codespaces`' `install.sh` / `install.ps1` similarly stopped at
    `zdd`; added both libs to editable and non-editable preinstall paths,
    again with marketplace/repo-root fallback handling.
  - `agent-ssh` needed `venue-copilot` in its shared vendored-lib
    resolver/fallback path; added a dedicated resolver on both shell
    variants and extended the pip-fallback dependency list to use it.
- Repo-wide `tests/` grep found **no hardcoded**
  `libs/session-liveness-probe` or `libs/venue-copilot` path in fixtures,
  runtime-gate tests, or shared generators. The only test updates needed
  were installer-contract assertions for the new preinstall/fallback
  coverage plus canonical-lib `conftest.py` files so the new top-level
  suites can run directly in CI.
- Added/updated canonical lib docs for the new state:
  `libs/session-liveness-probe/README.md`,
  `libs/session-liveness-probe/src/session_liveness_probe/__init__.py`,
  `libs/venue-copilot/README.md`,
  `libs/venue-copilot/src/venue_copilot/__init__.py`
  now describe the canonical-source + dev-time `uv`-editable /
  release-time materialization split instead of the old per-plugin-copy-only
  model.
- Extended CI's "Canonical shared-library tests" step to run
  `libs/session-liveness-probe/tests` and `libs/venue-copilot/tests`, since
  no converted consumer now carries those suites under its own tree.
- Validation/verification completed:
  - full repo gate green:
    `sync-vendored-libs.py --check`,
    `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`,
    `check-install-contract.py`,
    `check-version-consistency.py`,
    `check-module-size.py`,
    `check-docs-consistency.py`
  - converted consumer suites green:
    `agent-ssh`, `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`
  - fresh non-editable probe installs:
    `uv pip install --no-cache plugins/agent-containers` resolved
    `session_liveness_probe.__file__` to canonical
    `libs/session-liveness-probe/src/session_liveness_probe/__init__.py`;
    `uv pip install --no-cache plugins/agent-ssh` resolved
    `venue_copilot.__file__` to canonical
    `libs/venue-copilot/src/venue_copilot/__init__.py`
  - `materialize_main.py --dest` round-tripped converted consumers cleanly:
    `agent-containers` rewrote
    `agent-session-liveness-probe = { path = "libs/session-liveness-probe" }`
    and restored a byte-identical vendored tree; `agent-ssh` did the same
    for `agent-venue-copilot = { path = "libs/venue-copilot" }`, with
    `editable = true` stripped in both materialized manifests.
- **Still not done after this leg:** `agent-worktrees`' deliberately-
  excluded real `zdd` copy; `src-passthrough` retirement (once nothing
  else depends on it); Phase 2 (installer engine); Phase 3 (pattern doc /
  Phase 0-style broader audit).

### 2026-09-29 — `agent-worktrees`'s `plugin-activation` re-conversion attempted, blocked, reverted; `src-passthrough` retirement deferred

- Only two real `src-passthrough` `VENDOR_POINTER.json` copies remained
  repo-wide, both `plugin-activation`: `customizing-copilot`'s (permanent
  by design, `_resolve_state_py()` depends on it) and `agent-worktrees`'s
  (a stub, inconsistent with its siblings `plugin-resolve`/
  `dropin-registry`, which PR #4447 reverted to FULL real copies rather
  than leaving as stubs or pointers of any kind).
- Asked the operator directly (this was flagged in the prior leg's own
  Journal entry as needing a fresh maintainer call, mirroring the
  `agent-procutil` exclusion). **First answer: convert to `uv`-editable.**
  Attempted it: `sync-vendored-libs.py --uv-editable agent-worktrees
  plugin-activation`, then live `uv pip install
  plugins/agent-worktrees` and `uv pip install -e plugins/agent-worktrees`
  probes. **Both failed** with a `uv` resolver conflict: canonical
  `plugin-activation`'s own internal `[tool.uv.sources]` reference to
  `agent-dropin-registry` (and `agent-plugin-resolve`) collided with
  `agent-worktrees`'s own DELIBERATE real local copies of those same two
  libs — the exact "a lib depending on another vendored lib cannot be
  converted ahead of that dependency for any consumer that ALSO directly
  vendors the same dependency" ordering hazard first found during
  `ssh-manager`'s conversion, except here the dependency (`dropin-
  registry`/`plugin-resolve`) is PERMANENTLY real for this one consumer
  by deliberate build-surface design, not merely not-yet-converted — so
  there is no future ordering fix that resolves it short of undoing PR
  #4447's own decision.
- Reported the conflict back to the operator with three live options
  (revert to `src-passthrough` status quo; also convert `agent-worktrees`'s
  `dropin-registry`/`plugin-resolve` to `uv`-editable, undoing #4447;
  convert to a full real copy matching its siblings instead) plus a
  fourth to defer. **Operator's second, final answer: revert — leave
  `agent-worktrees`'s `plugin-activation` as `src-passthrough`
  (status quo).** The attempted conversion had already been cleanly
  reverted (no local copy deleted, no `pyproject.toml` rewritten, no
  commits made) before this answer came back, so no further action was
  needed to restore it.
- **`src-passthrough` retirement (Plan item) is therefore deferred, not
  done** — one real, non-permanent user of the pointer kind still exists
  (`agent-worktrees`'s `plugin-activation`), and it cannot be converted to
  any of the effort's other forms without either undoing a deliberate,
  separately-owned build-surface decision (PR #4447) or accepting a
  broken `uv` resolution for that one consumer. This is now the 3rd
  concrete piece of evidence for this effort's own Phase 2 (a canonical-
  reference form for the installer engine) and, more broadly, suggests
  `agent-worktrees`'s whole build-surface-vs-canonical-reference tension
  (procutil, zdd, and now plugin-activation) may need its own dedicated
  resolution rather than being chased one lib at a time — worth raising
  explicitly before the next leg spends more cycles on individual
  `agent-worktrees` exceptions.
- **Still not done after this leg:** `src-passthrough` retirement (blocked
  as above — revisit only after `agent-worktrees`'s build-surface tension
  gets its own resolution, or Phase 2 removes the need for it entirely);
  Phase 2 (installer engine); Phase 3 (pattern doc / Phase 0-style
  broader audit).

### 2026-09-29 — Phase 2: `agent-pull-requests`'s installer-engine converted to canonical-reference form

- Re-opened the sibling `vendored-installer-engine` effort's
  2026-09-12 byte-vendoring decision **with explicit operator approval in
  the driving session**, and recorded that approval in both efforts here
  rather than treating it as an implicit local call. The narrow approved
  change: use the same dev-time/live-reference -> promotion-time/materialize
  pattern already proven for shared Python libs, but only for the shared
  installer engine file pair itself. The shipped runtime/install path stays
  fully self-contained: promotion copies canonical back into each plugin's
  own `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` and rewrites the source line to
  the old local form before anything reaches `main`.
- Converted the only current engine adopter, `agent-pull-requests`, to that
  form. Re-verified first that its local `scripts/installer-engine.sh` and
  `.ps1` were byte-identical to `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.*`,
  then deleted both local copies entirely. Rewrote `scripts/install.sh` and
  `install.ps1` to source the canonical engine directly via
  `../../../libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.sh` and
  `..\..\..\libs\installer-engine\installer-engine.ps1`, respectively,
  matching the same "escape the consumer root to reach canonical" depth the
  `uv`-editable lib form uses from a plugin consumer.
- Extended `tools/check-install-contract.py`'s composed wrapper/engine
  detection to accept either a plugin-local engine source line or the new
  canonical relative-path source line, still only when the wrapper also
  makes a real engine-function call (`Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` /
  `invoke_uv_pip_install_resilient`, `Write-DeployManifest` /
  `write_deploy_manifest`) rather than merely mentioning the file or a
  function name in comments/strings.
- Extended `tools/sync-installer-engine.py`'s own `--check`/`verify()` to
  recognize the canonical-reference form as valid instead of "missing":
  it now validates a plugin whose installer source line escapes the plugin
  root, confirms the reference resolves to
  `libs/installer-engine/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}`, and enforces the Phase 2
  dev-tree invariant that no plugin-local `scripts/installer-engine.*` copy
  remains for that adopter. The old byte-vendored form still validates for
  adopters that continue to use it.
- Added a new shared helper module, `tools/installer_engine_ref.py`, then
  extended both materializers to reverse the dev-time reference at promotion
  time: `tools/materialize_main.py` now copies canonical back into
  `scripts/installer-engine.{sh,ps1}` and rewrites the source lines to the
  local form for a real release snapshot; `tools/preview_release.py` now
  performs the same copy-then-rewrite in its scratch preview copy. Added
  regression coverage in both paths for the success case and for missing /
  escaping engine references, mirroring Phase 1's `uv`-editable hardening.
- Found/fixed one implementation wrinkle along the way: Windows-style
  `..\..\..` source paths inside PowerShell installers need separator-aware
  normalization when validated from Linux-hosted tests, or the path check
  falsely treats them as literal filename characters instead of parent
  traversals. The new shared helper resolves both `/` and `\` separators
  explicitly, which made the cross-platform tests faithful to the real
  PowerShell semantics instead of host-path accidents.
- Validation completed for the conversion tooling slice and the real plugin:
  targeted unit coverage for the new helper/materializers/guard path, then
  the full repo gate (`sync-vendored-libs.py --check`,
  `sync-installer-engine.py --check`, `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`,
  `check-install-contract.py`, `check-version-consistency.py`,
  `check-module-size.py`, `check-docs-consistency.py`,
  `check-changefile-presence.py --base origin/dev`), `agent-pull-requests`'s
  full suite, fresh non-editable install probes with no local
  `scripts/installer-engine.*` present in the dev checkout, and both
  materializers' copy/rewrite outputs. Phase 3's pattern doc is still not
  started; the remaining future work is still the other 10 eventual engine
  adopters plus that separate documentation leg.

### 2026-09-30 — Phase 3 complete: pattern doc written; broader duplicate sweep closes with no new pointer candidate

- Wrote `docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md`, the repo's first consolidated
  operator-facing description of the **current** vendor-pointer model:
  file-pointer stubs for mirrored docs, `uv`-editable canonical references for
  shared libs, and the shared installer engine's direct canonical source-line
  form. The doc names the common lifecycle (`dev` canonical/stub ->
  `materialize_main.py` / `preview_release.py` copy-and-rewrite -> shipped
  self-contained `main` payload), points future adopters at concrete examples
  (`entity-relationship-model.md`, `lazy-cli-dispatch`, `agent-pull-requests`),
  and assigns the invariants to the actual owners (`sync-vendored-libs.py`,
  `uv_editable_ref.py`, `sync-installer-engine.py`, `installer_engine_ref.py`,
  `materialize_main.py`, `preview_release.py`, `check-install-contract.py`).
  Added it to `docs/patterns/README.md`'s index.
- Revisited Phase 0's broader "and more" audit with a bounded duplicate sweep:
  hashed duplicate files across `plugins/*/`, enumerated remaining
  `VENDOR_POINTER.json` holdouts (only the two known `plugin-activation`
  copies), and checked the repo's existing duplicate-management tools. Outcome:
  the remaining **large** duplicated surfaces already have explicit owners and
  are therefore not silent new candidates for this effort's pointer forms:
  `installation-context` is governed by `tools/sync-installation-context.py`,
  `versioned_runtime.py` and `resolve-runtime.*` by
  `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py` / `tools/check-runtime-resolution.py`, and
  `bootstrap-check.*` by `tools/check-bootstrap-sync.py`'s family model. The
  small repeated wrappers/configs left after that sweep (for example
  `write-session-guidance.*`, `session-context.json`, and family-specific
  hooks/wrappers) do not justify immediate conversion to either current pointer
  kind without inventing a broader third script/wrapper pattern first. **No
  new follow-up issue filed from this sweep**: nothing further presently
  warrants Phase-3 adoption of the current two pointer kinds beyond the
  already-tracked holdouts above.
- Phase 3 itself is now complete. The effort's overall Status remains
  unchanged because the Validation Plan still has open items (full real-plugin
  round-trip/losslessness, broad non-editable-install proof, live-edit-without-
  reinstall proof, full Phase 2 rollout proof, and no-regression confirmation).

### 2026-10-01 — Validation sweep: editable-suite proof completed; non-editable proof narrowed to a real agent-worktrees packaging bug

- **Checked off 5 Validation Plan items with fresh evidence:**
  - editable `dev` suites with **no local `libs/<lib>` directories**:
    bounded `tools/run-plugin-tests.py --reinstall` batches passed for every
    converted plugin suite (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`, `agent-mcp`,
    `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-vault`, `agent-dispatch`,
    `agent-logger`, `agent-ssh`, `agent-index`, `agent-machines`).
  - **live edit without reinstall**: a targeted `pytest` probe against
    `agent-ssh`'s real test venv imported `venue_copilot.MAX_SEED_CHARS`,
    observed the baseline `24000`, observed `24001` immediately after editing
    canonical `libs/venue-copilot/src/venue_copilot/__init__.py`, then passed
    again after reverting to `24000` — no reinstall at any point.
  - **promotion fail-closed for canonical references**: added
    `test_promote_refuses_when_a_uv_editable_reference_does_not_resolve`,
    extending the existing file-pointer promotion guard to a missing
    uv-editable canonical lib reference.
  - **Phase 2 dev-time dot-source proof**: `agent-pull-requests`'s
    unmaterialized `install.sh` ran `status` directly from `dev`, and a direct
    PowerShell dot-source of the exact canonical engine path loaded
    `Invoke-UvPipInstallResilient` successfully under `pwsh`.
  - **self-contained shipped-payload proof**: `preview_release.py` previews for
    `agent-pull-requests` and `agent-codespaces` materialized plugin-local
    `scripts/installer-engine.*` / `libs/*` content and rewrote manifests to
    local, non-editable paths only.
- **Broader no-regression proof completed**: the same 11-plugin editable suite
  sweep above is a stronger-than-representative cross-section for Phase 1's lib
  consumers, so the "no existing plugin's test suite regresses" validation item
  is now satisfied.
- **Round-trip/losslessness item remains OPEN, but the blocker is now
  specific:** a historical replay over 11 conversion commits / 63 converted
  paths showed a naive "current materializer output vs raw pre-conversion tree"
  diff is not a faithful baseline once a conversion PR also changed canonical
  README/test content in the same commit. That replay is still valuable
  evidence: the open problem is now *baseline construction*, not a confirmed
  current materializer corruption, but the item is not honestly checkable yet
  without a non-circular current-copy reconstructor.
- **Non-editable top-level suite proof remains OPEN because a real bug surfaced
  instead of a clean sweep:** direct non-editable suite runs passed for
  `agent-vault` and `agent-ssh`, extending the earlier `lazy-cli-dispatch`
  proof to two more real converted plugins. `agent-worktrees`, however, failed
  11 tests when installed non-editably into its test venv: the installed wheel
  does not carry payload-root assets the suite expects/runtime uses
  (`scripts/conduct/*.md`, `scripts/hook_client.py`, related binstub-adjacent
  payload files under the installed root). That is a genuine packaging gap, not
  a flaky validation harness. Leave this checklist item open until
  `agent-worktrees`'s non-editable payload layout is fixed and the same proof is
  extended further across the remaining converted plugins.
- **Net state after this sweep:** Validation Plan now has exactly **two**
  remaining unchecked items — the historical round-trip baseline problem above,
  and the broader non-editable top-level-suite proof now blocked on the
  `agent-worktrees` packaging bug. The effort is therefore **not yet ready** to
  be marked Done, but the remaining blockers are sharply narrowed and
  explicitly evidenced instead of still being generic "validation left to do."

### 2026-10-01 — Validation blockers status after wrap-up: round-trip closed, non-editable packaging still blocked in review

- **Round-trip/losslessness closed with a non-circular current baseline.**
  Added `tools/test_materialize_main.py::test_real_repo_uv_editable_
  materialization_matches_current_canonical_trees`, which walks the real
  repo's current `uv`-editable references (65 consumer/lib pairs across 12
  consumers), materializes each into a scratch consumer, then compares that
  output against a freshly reconstructed "what this would look like if
  byte-vendored RIGHT NOW" baseline built from the same current canonical
  source (`copy canonical -> materialize nested refs`). This avoids the stale
  historical-tree false positives the prior replay hit when a conversion PR had
  also changed canonical README/tests content. Result: zero `SKIP`s, zero tree
  drift.
- **`agent-worktrees` non-editable suite improved locally but NOT yet closed.**
  The installed wheel was missing payload-root assets the runtime/tests expect
  (`scripts/conduct/*.md`, `scripts/hook_client.py`, installer scripts, static
  binstubs, and related payload files). Fixed by shipping those non-Python
  assets under a dedicated packaged payload root, teaching runtime fallback
  resolution to find that packaged payload root in non-editable installs, and
  iterating on the remaining `plugin-activation` passthrough fallback. This is
  a **general packaging/runtime-layout defect found via this effort's
  validation sweep**, not a change to the core canonical-reference mechanism
  itself.
- **What verified locally before stopping:**
  - `python3 -m pytest tools/test_materialize_main.py tools/test_uv_editable_ref.py`
    -> passed (`116` then `117` after the direct-url regression test landed)
  - non-editable scratch-venv `agent-worktrees` full suite ->
    passed repeatedly (`6087`/`6089`/`6090` passed as follow-up tests landed)
  - editable `agent-worktrees` full suite via `tools/run-plugin-tests.py
    agent-worktrees --reinstall` -> passed
- **Why the non-editable item remains OPEN anyway:** PR #4767 review still has
  two specific packaging/runtime blockers:
  1. the packaged-fallback installer path still wants wrapper assets currently
     sourced from `worktree-manager/bin/*`, so the wheel payload is not yet
     self-contained under marketplace isolation (**tracked as #4787**); and
  2. the `plugin-activation` src-passthrough fallback currently relies on PEP
     610 `direct_url.json`, but review correctly notes that in a staged install
     that metadata can name the throwaway `.install-stage/...` source path
     rather than a durable checkout, so a later update can orphan the runtime
     (**tracked as #4788**).
- **Validation Plan status after stopping:** round-trip/losslessness is closed;
  the broader non-editable top-level-suite proof is still open for the concrete
  blocker above.
- **Effort status:** **not ready for Done**. Validation is not fully closed,
  and the Plan section still has its own unresolved work/blocked items.

### 2026-10-01 — PR #4767 merged; blocker 2 split into tracked follow-up issues

- PR **#4767** merged after the round-trip regression was tightened to exercise
  the whole-snapshot `materialize()` path and to build the expected vendored
  manifests independently rather than reusing the nested production helper as
  its oracle.
- The still-open non-editable packaging blocker is now split into two precise,
  public follow-ups instead of living only as review prose in this effort:
  - **#4787** — `agent-worktrees: package wrapper assets for non-editable fallback installs`
  - **#4788** — `plugin-activation: staged non-editable installs lose the remaining src-passthrough source`
- Validation status is unchanged by those issues being filed: blocker 2 remains
  OPEN until BOTH of those issues are resolved (or an equivalent change lands
  that removes both the packaged-wrapper self-containment gap and the staged
  `src-passthrough` source-loss risk safely).

### 2026-10-01 — `agent-worktrees` `plugin-activation` converted to a full real copy; #4788 closed

- Revisited the 2026-09-29 "attempted, blocked, reverted" decision under the
  narrower follow-up issue **#4788** and a new explicit operator directive:
  do **not** retry the `uv`-editable form for `agent-worktrees`; instead make
  this one consumer match its full-copy `dropin-registry`/`plugin-resolve`
  siblings and enforce the duplication mechanically.
- Deleted `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/plugin-activation/VENDOR_POINTER.json`
  and restored the full vendored library tree there (`__init__.py`,
  `resolver.py`, `state.py`, tests, metadata) with the consumer-local
  non-editable `pyproject.toml` references preserved for its sibling libs.
  The remaining `customizing-copilot` copy stays `src-passthrough` by design;
  its standalone `plugin-activation.py` still reads the pointer's `source`
  field directly and has no `pyproject.toml` surface the `uv`-editable form
  could target.
- Tightened `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` so a lib that now exists as a
  **mixed real+pointer set** compares the real vendored copy against canonical
  `libs/<lib>` and excludes pointer copies from the byte-identity surface.
  This is the compensating control for the deliberate DRY reversal here:
  `agent-worktrees`'s full copy now fails pre-push validation if it drifts
  from canonical, even though its only sibling copy is still just a pointer.
- Added committed regression coverage proving the staged-install symptom is
  gone: a test copies `agent-worktrees`'s vendored `plugin-activation`,
  `dropin-registry`, and `plugin-resolve` packages into a fake
  `site-packages` tree, writes a PEP 610 `direct_url.json` that points back at
  a throwaway `.install-stage/...` source, deletes that staged source, and
  confirms `import plugin_activation` still resolves entirely from the
  installed tree.
- Effect on this effort's open items:
  - **#4788 is closed by this leg.**
  - The non-editable validation blocker now narrows to **#4787 only**.
  - The long-deferred "`src-passthrough` retirement" Plan item **does not**
    fully close yet, because `customizing-copilot` still has the one
    structural, intentional pointer user described above.

### 2026-10-01 — Issue #4787 resolved: packaged launch-wrapper assets made self-contained

- Fixed the other half of the non-editable validation blocker: `agent-worktrees`'s
  `deploy_wrappers()` previously sourced launch-wrapper assets
  (`worktree-manager/bin/*`, plus transitive assets — `session-options.*`,
  `psmux-path.ps1`, `psmux-passthrough.conf` — found once the real packaged
  set was traced through) from a SIBLING directory outside the packaged
  plugin payload, violating `docs/install-contract.md`'s self-contained
  shipped-payload guarantee for a true marketplace-style install.
- Fix: added a manifest-driven packaged-asset set
  (`plugins/agent-worktrees/launch-wrapper-assets.json`, read by the new
  `tools/launch_wrapper_assets_ref.py`), materialized into preview/release
  payloads by new `tools/materialize_launch_wrapper_assets.py`, wired into
  both `tools/materialize_main.py` and `tools/preview_release.py` alongside
  the existing lib/installer-engine materialize steps. Dev-time canonical
  sources stay in `worktree-manager/bin/` unchanged; only the shipped
  payload now carries its own self-contained copy. Updated uninstall
  cleanup and docs (`plugins/agent-worktrees/docs/architecture.md`,
  `cli-reference.md`) to match.
- Added a packaged-preview regression proving `deploy_wrappers()` succeeds
  from a payload-only root with no sibling `worktree-manager/` directory
  present at all — directly exercising the issue's own symptom, not just
  the materialize step in isolation.
- Landed as PR #4796, merged. Issue #4787 closed.
- **Net effect:** with both #4787 and #4788 now closed, the non-editable
  top-level-install Validation Plan item (and its Phase 1 twin checklist
  item) have both their known BLOCKING BUGS resolved — but a subsequent
  review correctly found the broader "every converted plugin" claim was
  not yet earned: only `agent-worktrees`, `agent-vault`, and `agent-ssh`
  are directly confirmed non-editably (3 of 11 real converted plugin
  consumers — `lazy-cli-dispatch` is a lib `agent-worktrees` consumes, PR
  #4245, not a distinct fourth plugin). Both checklist items stay **open**
  below until the remaining suite matrix is run and recorded.

### 2026-10-01 — Master checklist consolidation pass

- Several umbrella/Phase checkboxes above had fallen behind their own
  sub-items and Journal entries after the last few parallel legs (each
  sub-agent closed its own narrow item but didn't always walk back up to
  flip the parent checkbox or fix now-stale "remaining two copies"-style
  phrasing). Swept the whole Plan + Validation Plan section and:
  - Checked off Phase 0's two audit items retroactively — they were
    genuinely satisfied by the 2026-09-30 "Phase 3 complete" entry's
    duplicate sweep, just never checked.
  - Checked off the Phase 1 umbrella "convert every real vendored lib"
    item — every sub-item under it was already `[x]`.
  - Corrected stale "BLOCKED for its remaining two copies" phrasing (now
    one copy, `customizing-copilot`'s, remains intentionally on
    `src-passthrough`; `agent-worktrees`'s is a closed full-copy exception).
  - **Correction (2026-10-01, later pass, after review):** an earlier
    version of this entry also checked off the Validation Plan's
    non-editable-install item and its Phase 1 twin. Review correctly
    pointed out that closing issues #4787/#4788 fixed the two *blocking
    bugs* but did not itself demonstrate the suite passes non-editably for
    every real converted plugin — only 3 of 11 are directly confirmed
    (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-vault`, `agent-ssh`).
    Both items are reverted to open; see the per-item status notes above
    for the precise remaining evidence gap.
- Three items remain genuinely, accurately open: the `src-passthrough`
  retirement Plan item (blocked on `customizing-copilot`'s structural
  pointer dependency — a separate, not-yet-scoped replacement for its
  `plugin-activation.py` script's load path), and the non-editable
  top-level-suite proof (Validation Plan item and its Phase 1 twin —
  blocking bugs fixed, remaining-plugin suite matrix not yet run).
- **Effort `Status:` intentionally left as `Draft`** — these items are
  still open, so this effort is not ready to be marked Done. The
  `src-passthrough` retirement item is a legitimate, narrowly-scoped
  follow-up (not tracked as a separate issue yet); the suite-matrix item
  just needs the remaining plugins run through the same non-editable
  check already proven 4 times over. A future session should either close
  both here or scope them as tracked follow-ups.

### 2026-10-01 — `customizing-copilot` `plugin-activation` converted to a full real copy; `src-passthrough` retired repo-wide

- Landed the final real consumer conversion for this mechanism (**PR #4805**):
  `plugins/customizing-copilot/libs/plugin-activation/` now matches the
  full real vendored copy shape `agent-worktrees` adopted earlier instead of
  carrying a `VENDOR_POINTER.json` passthrough stub. The standalone
  `installing-plugins/scripts/plugin-activation.py` loader no longer reads a
  pointer's `source` field at all; `_resolve_state_py()` now resolves the
  vendored local `state.py` directly, which works the same way in `dev` and
  in a materialized payload because this consumer never had a `pyproject.toml`
  surface the `uv`-editable mechanism could target.
- With that last holdout gone, the repo has **zero** live
  `src-passthrough` `VENDOR_POINTER.json` users. Per the Plan's own removal
  checklist, this leg then removed the retired kind's authoring/promote-time
  surfaces:
  - deleted `sync-vendored-libs.py`'s `--pointerize` writer path and the
    generated stub template (`tools/passthrough_pointer_template.py`), plus
    the writer-specific containment/regeneration tests; and
  - deleted `materialize_main.py` / `preview_release.py`'s directory-pointer
    expansion loop (`find_pointers`, `_materialize_one_pointer`, and the
    preview-only pointer-copy refresh pass), leaving only the still-live
    file-pointer and `uv`-editable / installer-engine / launch-wrapper
    materializers.
- **Explicitly kept** `_resolve_within()` / `_escapes_root()` /
  `_find_symlink()`: the file-pointer mechanism still depends on them, and
  the `uv`-editable reference rewrite continues to reuse `_escapes_root()`
  directly. The trusted worktree-manager compatibility copy was left as a
  legacy self-update reader for older payloads, but the current repo no
  longer authors or promotes this pointer kind anywhere.
- Reconfirmed the operator's main-branch invariant explicitly: `main` still
  ships **only real local files**. The new `customizing-copilot` full copy is
  committed directly on `dev`; `materialize_main.py` is now a no-op passthrough
  for that tree, and a full-repo materialized snapshot confirmed the
  `customizing-copilot/libs/plugin-activation/` payload is carried forward
  byte-for-byte unchanged with no cross-folder reference, no pointer file, and
  no `editable = true`.
- Net checklist state after this leg: the long-open `src-passthrough`
  retirement Plan item is now closed. The effort still is **not Done**:
  the only remaining unchecked work is the separate non-editable top-level
  suite proof already called out above (the Phase 1 twin checklist item plus
  the Validation Plan item), which stays intentionally untouched by this leg.

### 2026-10-02 — Non-editable top-level-suite proof completed across the remaining 8 plugins

- Closed the last open validation gap from the 2026-10-01 review correction:
  ran the same non-editable scratch-venv proof for the **remaining 8 real
  converted plugin consumers** — `agent-bridge`, `agent-mcp`,
  `agent-containers`, `agent-codespaces`, `agent-dispatch`,
  `agent-logger`, `agent-index`, and `agent-machines`. This deliberately
  **does not** count `lazy-cli-dispatch` as a twelfth plugin: it remains a
  shared lib that `agent-worktrees` consumes, not a distinct plugin
  consumer.
- Proof shape (same claim as the earlier `agent-worktrees`/`agent-vault`/
  `agent-ssh` evidence, now applied to the rest): for each plugin, created
  a fresh scratch venv, ran `uv pip install <plugin-dir>` **without `-e`**
  from the live `dev` checkout, verified the plugin's escaping
  `editable = true` `[tool.uv.sources]` dependencies still imported from
  canonical `libs/*/src`, then ran the plugin's own full suite through
  `test-supervisor`.
- Results:
  - `agent-bridge`: **2969 passed, 25 skipped**; confirmed canonical live
    imports for `agent-config-migrate`, `agent-credential-relay`,
    `agent-dropin-registry`, `agent-plugin-activation`,
    `agent-plugin-resolve`, `agent-procutil`,
    `agent-single-instance-lease`, `agent-ssh-manager`, and `agent-zdd`.
  - `agent-mcp`: **625 passed, 9 skipped**; confirmed canonical live
    imports for `agent-credential-relay`, `agent-procutil`,
    `agent-single-instance-lease`, and `agent-zdd`.
  - `agent-containers`: **560 passed, 4 skipped** after fixing a real
    non-editable source-root gap: the plugin's payload-local shim resolver
    now recovers the live source payload from `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT`,
    deploy-manifest source metadata, or PEP 610 `direct_url.json` when the
    top-level plugin itself is installed non-editably. Added regression
    coverage for those fallback sources.
  - `agent-codespaces`: **1579 passed, 13 skipped** after the same class of
    real non-editable source-root fix for its payload-local shim resolver,
    again with committed regression coverage.
  - `agent-dispatch`: **3756 passed, 11 skipped**; the real fix here was
    narrower and test-local: `test_build_info.py` now resolves
    `scripts/stamp_build_info.py` from the live source checkout (via the
    installed package's source metadata) instead of assuming a non-editable
    installed package still sits beside the repo's `scripts/` tree.
  - `agent-logger`: **664 passed, 37 skipped**.
  - `agent-index`: **714 passed, 3 skipped**; the contained proof needed a
    prepared sandbox temp/runtime tree so LanceDB's own spill/temp paths had
    somewhere real to write, after which the suite was green and canonical
    lib imports remained live.
  - `agent-machines`: **690 passed, 16 skipped**.
- Net effect: the formerly-open non-editable proof now covers **all 11**
  real converted plugin consumers: the prior 3
  (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-vault`, `agent-ssh`) plus the 8 above. Both
  the Phase 1 twin checklist item and the Validation Plan item are now
  honestly `[x]`.
- With those two checkboxes closed, **every currently-listed Plan phase and
  Validation Plan item in this effort is now checked off**. The effort may
  be ready for the operator to mark Done, but that status change itself is
  intentionally left to operator judgment rather than being flipped here.

### 2026-10-02 — Operator closure: marked Done, archived

- Operator confirmed every Plan phase and Validation Plan item is checked off
  (independently re-verified: zero `[ ]` boxes remain anywhere in this
  document) and directed closure.
- `Status` set to `Done`. Moved from `efforts/active/vendor-pointer-generalization/`
  to this archived location (`efforts/2026/10/02 vendor-pointer-generalization/`),
  removed from `efforts/README.md`'s active effort index.
- Final mechanism state for future reference: shared libs and the installer
  engine use the `uv`-editable canonical-reference form (live `dev`-time
  reference, `materialize_main.py`/`preview_release.py` copy-and-rewrite at
  promotion); docs use the unrelated, unaffected file-pointer form; the
  `src-passthrough` pointer kind is fully retired repo-wide (its last two
  real users, `agent-worktrees`'s and `customizing-copilot`'s
  `plugin-activation` copies, were both converted to full real
  byte-vendored copies with enforced sync, issues #4788 and the 2026-10-01
  retirement respectively). See `docs/patterns/vendor-pointer.md` for the
  durable operator-facing description of both current forms.
