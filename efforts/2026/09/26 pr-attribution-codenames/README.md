# PR Attribution Codenames

- **Slug:** `pr-attribution-codenames`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions (agent-worktrees plugin)
- **Branch(es):** `pr/<slug>` per phase
- **Created:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Done <!-- Draft | Active | Blocked | Done -->
- **Vision:** vision-extending — extends the existing `source_attribution`
  marker capability (today boolean: on/off) with a third, public-safe mode.
- **Umbrella issue:** [#2838](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2838)

## Guiding Intent

Give an author a way to trace a PR back to its originating worktree even on
a repo where raw machine/worktree/session identifiers must never be
published — without inventing a new private-identifier leak in the process.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| copilot-extensions maintainer(s) | design + implementation | this worktree |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase PRs (small, reviewable increments)
- **Host (owns PRs):** this worktree/author
- **Delegates:** none
- **Handoff:** n/a

## Context

`agent-worktrees` already supports a `source_attribution` config flag: when
`true`, `create-pr` embeds a hidden PR-body marker carrying the source
machine/worktree/session/head. This is intentionally `false` by default and
documented as required-`false` for public repos, since raw
machine/worktree/session identifiers (and worktree-derived branch names) are
private identifiers that must never reach a public surface.

That leaves a real gap: on a public repo, an author has **no** way to trace
an open PR back to the worktree that opened it. In practice this shows up as
PRs that stall in review with no way to rehydrate the right context and push
them forward — and the absence of *any* marker has already let one leak slip
through a different path: a PR was observed with its head published as the
literal `worktree/<id>` branch name, putting the raw worktree id (and an
embedded timestamp) directly into a public branch name. That is exactly the
class of exposure `source_attribution: false` is meant to prevent, arriving
by a route the flag doesn't cover.

**Correcting this effort's first-draft mechanics** (per review): the two
`head_scheme` values do not work the way the first draft described.
`refspec` (the default) keeps the worktree on its local `worktree/<id>`
branch and pushes it via an explicit git refspec straight to a remote
`pr/<slug>-<suffix>` ref — the local `worktree/<id>` name is never itself
the published head. `snapshot` instead creates and pushes a local
`feature/<slug>-<suffix>` branch. Neither default path publishes a raw
`worktree/<id>` name; the observed leak happened through an **override** —
an explicit `--branch`, an existing-PR reuse, or a `head_pattern` containing
`{machine}`/`{worktree_id}` — not through `head_scheme` selection itself.
Phase 5 below is corrected to close the actual leak surface (the effective
published ref, however selected), not a mischaracterized scheme default.

**Threat model — accepted linkability, not full anonymity.** A persistent
per-worktree codename is public-safe against decoding (no machine, date, or
sequence information), but it is **not** unlinkable: the same codename
recurring across multiple public PRs/branches lets an outside reader
correlate them as coming from one actor over time, even without knowing who
or where that actor is. This effort accepts that tradeoff deliberately —
the goal is *decoding* prevention (machine/worktree/session/timestamp never
recoverable), not *correlation* prevention. A rotating/per-PR codename would
close the correlation gap but breaks author-side lookup utility (the
"nudge a stalled worktree" use case), which is the whole point; it is noted
as a possible future variant, not a Phase 1–5 requirement.

The fix is a form of attribution that is **informationless to an outside
reader about machine/worktree/session/timestamp** but a valid lookup key for
the author: a random, themed codename with no encoded machine, date, or
sequence data — assigned once per worktree and carried as the *only* thing a
public marker (or, worse, a leaked branch name) ever exposes.

**Design pivot: declarative wordlist file, not an executable hook.** The
first implementation attempt let an adopter configure an external *shell
command* hook to supply a themed vocabulary. That single design choice
required ten review rounds of subprocess-safety hardening (process-tree
cleanup on timeout, cross-platform kill semantics, bounded-memory reads,
truncation detection, timeout-value validation, encoding failures, a
reap-after-kill race) — none of it related to codenames at all, just the
generic cost of "run an adopter-supplied command with a timeout." The
operator's own steer settled it: this is **purely declarative data** —
words and, optionally, the permitted combinations between them — so Phase 1
now reads a JSON/YAML file instead of running anything. That removes the
entire subprocess-safety surface by construction: no timeout, no process to
kill, no encoding-from-a-subprocess concern, no zombie/leak risk.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Neutral codename generation (agent-worktrees-owned)
- [x] Add a small, dependency-free "handle" generator to `agent-worktrees`
  itself: 1–2 word, lowercase, hyphen-joined, branch/filename-safe, backed
  by a **generic, organization-neutral** word list (no product theming —
  this plugin is general-purpose; themed vocabularies are an adopter-side
  concern, not a plugin default). Landed in `agent_worktrees.codename`
  (mechanical/workshop-themed word list, `generate_handle`,
  `is_valid_handle`).
- [x] Support an optional **declarative wordlist file**: a config value
  (`codename.wordlist_path`) naming a JSON or YAML file the adopter
  maintains. This lets a private control repo plug in its own themed
  vocabulary (nouns, optionally adjectives, optionally an explicit list of
  *permitted* adjective-noun pairings to avoid unwanted combinations)
  without that vocabulary ever living in this public plugin — with **no
  executable-hook surface at all**. Landed in
  `agent_worktrees.codename.load_wordlist`/`load_wordlist_or_default`
  (strict structural validation: required non-empty `nouns`, optional
  `adjectives`, optional `pairs` overriding the full cross-product; every
  word individually validated lowercase-alnum, bounded length, no hyphens
  of its own) and `agent_worktrees.codename_config.CodenameConfig`/
  `parse_codename`, wired into `RepoConfig`/`config_dropins` alongside the
  existing `pr:` block. A missing/malformed file fails soft to the
  built-in wordlist (`load_wordlist_or_default`) rather than blocking
  worktree creation over a data-file typo.
- [x] Collision-avoid against the local tracking store (retry on collision,
  same spirit as the existing registry-checked mode of comparable
  generators) — no new persistence primitive for the *local* check (Phase 3
  covers cross-machine uniqueness, which this local check cannot guarantee
  alone). Landed as `agent_worktrees.codename.assign_codename(existing,
  ...)`, generic over any iterable of already-used handles and an optional
  `Wordlist`; Phase 2 wires it to the actual tracking-store read.

### Phase 2 — Per-worktree codename assignment + local lookup
- [x] Assign one codename per worktree at `create` time; store it on the
  worktree's local tracking record next to `id`. Landed as
  `WorktreeRecord.codename` (`tracking.py`) plus
  `agent_worktrees.codename_tracking.assign_new_codename`/`allocation_lock`,
  wired into `_create_worktree_core` (and the paired-knowledge `-k` carve)
  before any git/owner-claim side effect, under a cross-process lock held
  across the whole assign -> create -> write sequence.
- [x] **Backfill path:** landed as `codename_tracking.ensure_codename`,
  wired into the `_resolve_resume` and `_cmd_status_write` first-touch
  paths (an explicit resume or status touch backfills a legacy record's
  missing codename), rather than `create-pr`'s not-yet-built `codename`
  mode (that's Phase 4). Covered by an end-to-end legacy-record test plus
  a genuine multi-threaded concurrency test against `retire_record`.
- [x] `list`/`resolve` accept `--codename <name>` as an alternate selector
  alongside the existing `--worktree-id`. Landed via
  `worktree_identity.resolve_worktree_id_by_codename`; an unmatched
  codename is a hard error in `resolve` and an empty result in `list`
  (never falls back to ID-suffix matching).
- [x] `status`/picker surfaces the codename so an author can correlate a
  public PR's codename back to a visible worktree without extra lookup
  steps. Landed via `_worktree_to_dict`, feeding both `status --json` and
  `list --json`.

### Phase 3 — Cross-machine reverse lookup

**Descoped design (operator steer, 2026-09-18):** NOT a shared
atomic-reservation registry (the original draft below this note, now
superseded). The "cross-machine registry" is exactly what it sounds like —
**SSH into each known machine and read its own local tracking store** — no
new persistence primitive, no atomic reservation. This trades collision
*prevention* for collision *detection*: two machines can still (rarely)
generate the same codename concurrently, and a cross-machine scan reports
that as an explicit ambiguous-collision error rather than silently
resolving to one of them, instead of a shared store making it impossible in
the first place.

- [x] SSH-endpoint verb (`codename-lookup <codename> --json`, mirroring the
  existing `claimant-liveness` cross-machine-reap-safety pattern exactly):
  reports whether the active project's LOCAL tracking store has a worktree
  with the given codename, on whatever machine it runs on. Landed in
  `__main__.py` (`cmd_codename_lookup`), reusing
  `worktree_identity.resolve_worktree_id_by_codename` (the existing Phase 2
  local resolver, unchanged).
- [x] Cross-machine scan module (`codename_reverse_lookup.py`): enumerates
  every other known, Copilot-enabled, ssh-ready machine from `machines.yaml`
  (excluding self), SSHes to each and invokes `codename-lookup` there via
  the project's own binstub (same pwsh-EncodedCommand-on-Windows /
  `bash -lc`-elsewhere wrapping as `claimant.py`'s remote probe), and
  aggregates the results. `resolve_codename_cross_machine` returns every
  match (0, 1, or — a genuine collision — more than 1);
  `resolve_codename_cross_machine_unique` raises `AmbiguousCodenameError` on
  more than one match rather than silently picking one. Promoted
  `claimant._resolve_machine_ssh` to public `resolve_machine_ssh` (kept a
  private alias for its own call site + existing tests) so both modules
  share one "how do I SSH to this machine key" resolver instead of forking
  the logic.
- [x] **The mirrored value carries enough to actually resolve remotely.**
  The remote probe is scoped to `project` — the current active project's
  name, threaded into the SSH command exactly as the original checklist
  required, without needing a `{machine, project/repo, worktree_id}` mirror
  record: the SSH endpoint always answers for whatever project its own
  binstub represents, so the caller supplying its own current project name
  is sufficient (a codename is only assigned/collision-checked within one
  project's tracking directory in Phase 1/2, so a cross-machine lookup for
  "the same codename I have locally" is only meaningful against the SAME
  project name elsewhere).
- [x] **Remote resolution fails closed, never delegates.** Where the
  codename's worktree lives on a **different** machine than the one doing
  the lookup, `resolve --codename <name>` / `embody --codename <name>`
  cannot start a local mux directly — landed as the explicit choice the
  original checklist asked to make: **fail closed** with a clear
  "resolves to worktree '<id>' on machine '<machine>' ... remote launch is
  not supported" message (`_resolve_codename_anywhere` in `__main__.py`),
  not an agent-bridge delegation. `embody` gained a `--codename` selector
  (it previously only accepted `--worktree-id`/`--new`) wired to the same
  local-then-cross-machine resolution as `resolve`.

### Phase 4 — `source_attribution: codename` mode
- [x] Extend `source_attribution` from boolean to accept `true | false |
  codename`. `codename` emits a hidden PR-body marker carrying **only** the
  codename — no machine, worktree id, session id, or timestamp. Landed as
  `PRConfig.source_attribution: SourceAttribution` (`bool | Literal["codename"]`,
  tightened after review from an initial `bool | str`), parsed in `config.py`
  (case-insensitive `"codename"`, any other string falls back to `False`
  rather than silently enabling the raw marker) and validated in
  `config_dropins._validate_pr`.
- [x] **Cover both marker-writing paths, not just PR creation.** There are
  two places a marker is written: the initial `create-pr` body, and
  `refresh_source_attribution` (used when a later push updates an existing
  PR's head). Both must honor `codename` mode identically — an
  implementation that only updates the initial-body path would leave the
  refresh path free to write the full raw marker on the very next push,
  reintroducing the leak on an already-open PR. Test both paths under
  `codename` mode, not just PR creation. Landed as
  `attribution.build_codename_marker` used from both `_open_via_provider`
  and `refresh_source_attribution`; a worktree with no assigned codename
  (should not happen post-Phase-2, but defensively) skips the marker
  entirely rather than downgrading to the raw one.
- [x] Document the three modes and when each is appropriate (private
  closed-circuit repo vs. public repo that still wants author-side
  traceability vs. fully anonymous). Landed in
  `docs/config-reference.md` and `skills/worktree/references/pr-workflow.md`.

### Phase 5 — Close the branch-name leak class
- [x] **Validate the effective published ref, not just the `head_scheme`
  default.** Per the corrected Context above, neither `head_scheme` default
  publishes a raw `worktree/<id>` name — the observed leak came from an
  override (explicit `--branch`, existing-PR reuse, or a `head_pattern`
  containing `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}`). The real fix is to validate the
  **effective remote head** at the publish boundary: whatever `--branch`/
  `head_pattern`/existing-PR-reuse resolves to, when `source_attribution`
  isn't `true`, must not contain the raw worktree id, machine name, or a
  literal `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}` substitution. Reject at publish time
  if it does. Landed as
  `providers.attribution.validate_effective_head`/`BranchLeakError`, called
  from `create_pr` immediately after `feature_branch` is resolved (covers
  the explicit `--branch`, live-active-PR-reuse, and rendered-`head_pattern`
  paths uniformly, before the dry-run response and before any push) — and
  from `finalize.push_changes`'s two publish paths (`_push_changes_pr`,
  `_push_changes_pr_refspec`), which republish `record.pr.branch` on every
  re-push independent of `create_pr` and needed the same guard (review
  round 2 caught this second boundary). Checks both the LIVE `config.machine`
  and the worktree's originally RECORDED `record.machine` at every call site
  (review round 3 caught that a machine rename/migration otherwise left an
  old identifying branch unchecked against the live name alone).
- [x] **Hard error, not a warning.** A warning still lets the push proceed
  with an identifying ref. When `source_attribution` isn't `true` and the
  effective head would carry a private identifier, this must be a hard
  configuration/publish-time error that blocks the push — never a
  warn-and-continue. Landed: `create_pr` returns `{"success": False,
  "error": ...}` (and the CLI reports it) before any git/network side
  effect; the same check gates the dry-run response too.
- [x] Audit existing repo configs for the actual risk surface: any repo
  where `source_attribution` is `false` **or absent** (it defaults to
  `false`, so an audit that only greps for the literal string `false` misses
  configs that omit the key entirely) combined with any path that could
  produce an identifying effective head (`head_scheme: refspec` with no
  further override, an explicit `--branch`, or a `head_pattern` using
  `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}`). Include the new `codename` mode as a target
  migration state in the same scan, not just a flag for `true`/`false`.
  Landed as `providers.attribution.audit_source_attribution_risk`/
  `head_pattern_leak_risk` (config-only, distinguishes an explicit `false`
  from a genuinely absent key) plus `pr_ops.audit_attribution_risk` and the
  `agent-worktrees attribution-audit` CLI command (scans the active
  project's own config; a fleet-wide multi-repo scanner is not built here —
  the per-repo primitive is the reusable building block for one).

## Validation Plan

- [x] Unit tests: handle generator format (lowercase, hyphen-joined,
  branch-safe), collision retry, wordlist-file loading (valid YAML/JSON,
  missing file, malformed data, missing/empty/non-list/non-string/
  malformed-word `nouns`, explicit `pairs` overriding the cross-product,
  fail-soft fallback to the built-in wordlist on any load error). 52 tests
  landed in `test_codename.py`/`test_codename_config.py`.
- [x] Unit tests: `source_attribution: codename` marker contains the
  codename and *no* machine/worktree/session/timestamp substrings, on
  **both** the initial `create-pr` body path and the
  `refresh_source_attribution` path. 4 tests landed in `test_providers.py`
  (`TestCreatePRAutoOpen`) and `test_pr_ops.py`
  (`TestPRFinalizeAndPush`), including the no-codename-assigned case
  (skip, never downgrade to the raw marker).
- [x] Integration test: `create` → codename assigned and persisted →
  `resolve --codename` / `embody --codename` round-trip on the same
  machine. Landed in `test_codename_cli.py`'s existing
  `TestCodenameSelectorWiring` class:
  `test_cmd_resolve_matched_codename_sets_worktree_id_before_launch_logic`
  (already present from Phase 2) plus the new
  `test_cmd_embody_matched_codename_sets_raw_id_before_launch_logic`,
  which also asserts the cross-machine scan is never invoked on a local
  hit.
- [x] Integration test: pre-existing (backfilled) worktree record with no
  codename → `source_attribution: codename` newly enabled → first
  `create-pr` allocates and persists a codename correctly. Was a genuine
  BEHAVIOR gap (not just missing coverage), found and fixed this session
  while verifying this item: `_open_via_provider`'s `codename` branch
  previously only READ `record.codename` and silently skipped the marker
  when missing, never calling `codename_tracking.ensure_codename` the way
  `resolve`/`resume`/`status --write` do. A legacy/never-touched worktree
  that newly enabled `codename` mode got NO attribution on its first PR.
  Fixed by backfilling (in place, never reassigning `record` -- that would
  silently detach it from `target_pr`'s later mutations) when the codename
  is genuinely missing; a present-but-MALFORMED codename still skips (that
  safety behavior is unchanged). Landed as
  `test_codename_mode_backfills_a_missing_codename`
  (`test_providers.py`), with the three sibling "skip" tests
  (`test_codename_mode_skip_strips_a_stale_marker_from_the_body`,
  `test_codename_mode_skip_does_not_record_attribution_head`, the
  malformed-codename test) updated to use a malformed (not missing)
  codename to keep exercising the still-skips-on-malformed path.
- [x] ~~Integration test: concurrent codename reservation from two machines
  for the same generated candidate resolves to exactly one owner~~ —
  **N/A under the descoped design**: there is no atomic reservation to
  test (the operator explicitly rejected that primitive). Replaced by:
  Integration test that a genuine cross-machine collision (two machines
  both reporting a match for the same codename) surfaces as
  `AmbiguousCodenameError` and is never silently resolved to one of them.
  Landed as
  `TestResolveCodenameCrossMachine::test_collision_raises_ambiguous`
  (`test_codename_reverse_lookup.py`).
- [x] ~~Integration test: cross-machine mirror write + read~~ — **replaced**
  under the descoped design by a direct SSH-scan test: a codename created
  on a mocked "machine B" is resolved from "machine A" by scanning
  `machines.yaml`, SSHing to every other ssh-ready machine, and invoking
  `codename-lookup` there — no mirror/discovery store involved. Landed as
  `test_codename_reverse_lookup.py` (21 tests: `_known_machine_keys`,
  `_remote_probe_cmd`/`_parse_lookup`, `_probe_machine`,
  `resolve_codename_cross_machine`/`_unique`, mocking `subprocess.run`
  exactly like `test_claimant.py`'s remote-probe tests) plus
  `test_cli_routing.py`'s `codename-lookup` CLI tests (the SSH endpoint
  itself: parser/registration, JSON found/not-found, plain mode) and its
  `TestResolveCodenameAnywhere` class + `test_embody_codename_remote_fails_closed`
  (`resolve`/`embody`'s shared fail-closed behavior when a match is on a
  different machine, or ambiguous across more than one).
- [x] Regression: existing `source_attribution: true`/`false` behavior on
  private repos is unchanged (no marker content or format change for those
  modes). Verified: the leak-guard is a no-op whenever `source_attribution
  is True`, and the default/snapshot/refspec head-pattern paths (which never
  embed `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}`) are unaffected —
  `TestCreatePRBranchLeakGuard.test_safe_default_head_pattern_is_unaffected`
  plus the full existing `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py` suites (443
  tests) pass unchanged.
- [x] Config/publish-time validation: when `source_attribution` isn't
  `true`, an effective published head containing the raw worktree id,
  machine name, or an unsubstituted `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}` pattern is a
  **hard error that blocks the push** (not a warning) — cover the default
  path, an explicit `--branch` override, and a `head_pattern` override.
  6 tests landed in `TestCreatePRBranchLeakGuard`
  (`test_pr_ops.py`) plus 7 unit tests on `validate_effective_head` itself
  in `TestValidateEffectiveHead` (`test_providers.py`).
- [x] Migration-audit test: a repo config with `source_attribution` entirely
  absent (not just explicit `false`) is correctly flagged by the audit
  tooling from Phase 5. 6 tests landed in `TestAuditSourceAttributionRisk`
  (`test_providers.py`, the raw `None`-vs-`False` distinction), 5 in
  `TestAuditAttributionRisk` (`test_pr_ops.py`, the parsed-`Config` entry
  point -- including `PRConfig.source_attribution_configured`, the field
  added so the audit can tell a genuinely-absent key apart from an explicit
  `false`), 2 in `test_config.py` (parsing that field from raw YAML), and 5
  CLI-level tests in `TestAttributionAuditCLI` (`test_pr_ops.py`) covering
  the plain-mode finding/no-finding paths, JSON-mode exit-0-with-findings,
  and the config-load-failure path in both output modes.

## Proposal

_Pending review._

## Journal

### 2026-09-26 — Archived
Every Plan and Validation Plan item is resolved. Moved to the dated archive
path as part of a batch archive sweep of completed efforts.

### 2026-09-17 — Kickoff
- Effort created from a sweep of stalled PRs on this repo: none carried any
  attribution marker, and one leaked a raw `worktree/<id>` branch name as its
  PR head. Filed as issue #2838; this effort captures the phased design.

### 2026-09-17 — Review round: corrected mechanics + closed 12 design gaps
- Automated review (12 findings: 4 high / 6 medium / 2 low) caught that the
  first draft mischaracterized `head_scheme`'s actual behavior (neither
  `refspec` nor `snapshot` publishes a raw `worktree/<id>` name by default —
  the observed leak came from an override) and left several real gaps:
  codename linkability wasn't named as an accepted tradeoff; no backfill
  path for pre-existing worktree records; the external generator hook had
  no execution bounds or fail-closed behavior; the cross-machine registry
  was assumed reusable from `claims mirror-status` without checking it
  actually supports lookup/reservation; no atomic reservation to prevent
  two machines allocating the same handle; the mirrored value omitted the
  project reference `embody` actually needs; the marker-refresh path
  (`refresh_source_attribution`) wasn't covered alongside PR creation; and
  the leak-closing validation allowed a warning instead of a hard error.
- Revised Context (corrected `head_scheme` mechanics + explicit threat-model
  note) and every affected Plan phase; expanded the Validation Plan to
  match. No phase count changed, but Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 all gained
  concrete requirements they previously lacked.

### 2026-09-17 — Review round 2: hook-guarantee scoping fix
- Follow-up review (2 findings) caught one remaining real gap: syntax
  format-validation on external generator hook output does not prove the
  output is *semantically* non-identifying (a hook could emit a
  syntactically valid but identifying handle, e.g. `machine-20260917`).
  Scoped Phase 1's public-safety guarantee to hold unconditionally only for
  the built-in generator, and made using a non-default hook under
  `source_attribution: codename` an explicit, warned trust decision on the
  hook owner rather than an implicit guarantee. (The review's second
  finding — a missing Documentation impact statement — was a timing
  artifact: the PR body was updated with that statement in the same push
  cycle the review ran against, just after the review started; the live PR
  body already carries it.)

### 2026-09-18 — Design pivot: dropped the hook, went purely declarative
- The hook-based Phase 1 implementation went through **ten** review rounds,
  each closing a genuine subprocess-safety bug: process-group isolation on
  timeout, bounded-memory reads, truncation-then-strip validation, a
  Windows headless-launch guard violation, timeout-value validation
  (non-finite/oversized/boolean), a non-string `hook_command` becoming a
  real shell command via `str(None) == "None"`, a Windows-specific
  `taskkill` console-window leak, missing test coverage (non-UTF-8 output,
  the actual `load_config` wiring), and — twice — the process-group cleanup
  itself: first not sweeping a backgrounded descendant when the hook shell
  exited successfully rather than timing out, then a subtler bug in *that*
  very fix (`os.getpgid(pid)` fails once the process is already reaped, so
  the "fix" silently no-op'd on exactly the case it targeted).
- None of those ten findings were about codenames — every one was the
  generic cost of "run an adopter-supplied shell command with a timeout."
  Raised to the operator mid-review; the answer was direct: make it purely
  declarative. **Reset the branch to `main`** (discarding all ten
  hook-hardening commits — they were fixing a mechanism this pivot
  removes entirely, not preserving anything worth rebasing forward) and
  reimplemented Phase 1 around a JSON/YAML **wordlist file** instead of an
  executable hook: `codename.wordlist_path` names a file declaring `nouns`
  (required), optional `adjectives`, and an optional explicit `pairs` list
  for an adopter who wants to declare *permitted relationships* rather than
  a full cross-product. No subprocess, no timeout, no process to kill, no
  encoding-from-a-subprocess concern — the entire ten-round problem class
  is structurally impossible now, not just hardened against.
- Landed in one clean commit: `agent_worktrees.codename`
  (`Wordlist`/`load_wordlist`/`load_wordlist_or_default`/`generate_handle`/
  `assign_codename`) and `agent_worktrees.codename_config`
  (`CodenameConfig`/`parse_codename`), wired into `RepoConfig`/
  `config_dropins` exactly as the hook version was. 52 tests (down from the
  hook version's 65 — no subprocess tests needed), and markedly faster
  (~3s vs ~8s, no process spawning).

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 2 implemented, PR #2868 in review (7 rounds so far)
- Implemented Phase 2 in a fresh worktree: `WorktreeRecord.codename` field
  + YAML round-trip (`tracking.py`); new `agent_worktrees.codename_tracking`
  module (kept separate -- `tracking.py`/`__main__.py` are at/near their
  module-size-baseline ceiling) with `existing_codenames`/
  `assign_new_codename` (local collision avoidance), `allocation_lock` (a
  cross-process lock over one project's tracking dir, 30s timeout to
  tolerate git I/O held under it), `ensure_codename` (lazy backfill), and
  `find_record_by_codename` (reverse lookup); `create` assigns a codename
  (both the primary path and the paired-knowledge `-k` carve, using each
  project's own wordlist config); `list`/`resolve` accept `--codename` as an
  alternate selector; `_worktree_to_dict` surfaces it in JSON (feeding
  `status`/`list`/the Picker); `ensure_codename` wired into the resume and
  status-write first-touch paths per the plan's backfill design.
- Opened as PR #2868. Through **7 automated review rounds so far**, every
  one catching a genuine issue (not a single trivial nit): the marketplace
  catalog's top-level `metadata.version` bump was missed initially; the
  paired knowledge worktree wasn't getting its own codename; a real
  concurrent-allocation race (scan-then-write with no shared lock spanning
  both); an `ensure_codename` bug that saved the caller's stale in-memory
  record instead of the freshly re-read on-disk one (clobbering concurrent
  field changes); an unmatched `--codename` in `resolve` silently falling
  through to the picker instead of erroring; codename allocation running
  AFTER git worktree creation (so an exhausted finite wordlist could orphan
  a checkout) and AFTER the owner-claim journal write (so it could leave a
  dangling owner obligation); a genuine cross-process lock-ordering deadlock
  hazard between `create` (owner-lock-then-allocation-lock) and
  `ensure_codename` (allocation-lock-then-record-lock); an unmatched
  `--codename` in `list` falling back to ID-suffix matching (risking a wrong
  match); and PR-description/baseline-value mismatches as the diff grew
  across rounds (module-size ceiling stated as 28495 when the actual
  recorded value was higher; version numbers stated as intermediate values
  rather than the final ones).
- **Still open at handoff time (round 7's finding, unaddressed):**
  `retire_record` (tracking.py, ~line 2930-2960) deletes a tracking YAML via
  a plain `path.unlink(missing_ok=True)` in two places (the sibling-both-
  reaped hard-delete branch, and the final fallback) **without** taking
  `_RecordLock` at all. `ensure_codename`'s per-record lock is therefore not
  a complete guarantee against resurrecting a reaped record:
  `retire_record` can still unlink the file between `ensure_codename`'s
  existence check and its `save_record` call, because retirement doesn't
  participate in the same lock protocol. Fixing this means making
  `retire_record`'s unlinks (including the paired-sibling unlink) acquire
  `_RecordLock` too -- but that function's own docstring establishes an
  explicit fail-safe philosophy ("a reap must never be blocked by this
  bookkeeping"; the tombstone-write path already falls back to a plain
  unlink on any exception), so the lock acquisition needs to preserve
  that property (never let this new lock permanently block a reap) rather
  than just wrapping the existing unlinks blindly. `retire_record` is a
  widely-used, carefully specified shared function (paired-worktree
  tombstoning, siblings, `find_paired_record` semantics) -- treat this as
  its own careful, focused fix, not a rushed patch under a different task's
  time pressure.
- PR #2868 is otherwise clean (checks green, mergeable, `pr-self-merge`
  profile) and full-suite-green (4606 passed; 5 pre-existing unrelated
  failures in `test_handoff_cutover.py`/`test_update_stage.py`, confirmed
  via isolation). Resume with `/consume-handoff` or by reading this entry;
  the PR itself carries the complete round-by-round history in its review
  thread if more detail is needed.

### 2026-09-18 — PR #2868 merged (Phase 2 done)
- The `retire_record` locking gap noted above was fixed: `retire_record`
  now takes a real cross-process lock (`require_sidecar=True`) around every
  delete, including a deterministic (sorted) lock order for the
  both-reaped paired hard-delete branch (closing a genuine cross-call
  deadlock the fix itself could otherwise introduce), and returns `bool`
  (defers retirement to a later reap pass on lock contention rather than
  either blocking a reap indefinitely or deleting without real exclusivity).
  Both call sites in `__main__.py` updated to gate follow-up bookkeeping on
  the actual outcome.
- Two further review rounds (8 total) each caught one more real issue: a
  raw worktree/machine identifier that had leaked into this file's own
  prior journal entry (redacted -- corrected above), and the deadlock/
  TOCTOU gaps in the `retire_record` fix itself just described.
- After round 8's fixes, round 9's rendered comment list re-surfaced 11
  prior findings as "Open" -- a GraphQL `reviewThreads(isResolved)` check
  showed all but 4 were `isOutdated: true` (stale carryover, matching the
  documented reviewer-thread-carryover gotcha), and the remaining 4
  (`isOutdated: false, isResolved: false`) were verified against the
  actual current code/PR-description state and were already fixed in
  substance -- the threads just hadn't been marked resolved. No further
  code changes were needed.
- Merged via `pr-merge 2868 --now` (this repo's `pr-self-merge` profile:
  the live verdict read `COMMENTED`/"not yet approved" even after checks
  passed, which is expected here, not a blocker).
- **Phase 2 is done.** Phases 3-5 (cross-machine reverse lookup,
  `source_attribution: codename` mode, closing the branch-name-leak class)
  remain -- see the Plan section above for the next slice.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 4 landed (`source_attribution: codename` mode)

Picked up from a handoff after a separate session-local investigation (in a
downstream/private control repo, not part of this effort) had already
independently found and fixed the same class of leak this effort targets --
the raw `worktree_id`-as-fallback-title bug -- confirming the underlying
concern is real and recurring, not hypothetical.

**Design decision on Phase 3 (recorded here since it changes that phase's
scope):** the operator confirmed the cross-machine "registry" should be
exactly what it sounds like -- SSH into each known machine and read its own
local tracking store -- not a new shared atomic-reservation primitive. This
descopes Phase 3's originally-planned dedicated registry store; a codename
collision across two machines minting concurrently is treated as an
accepted (astronomically unlikely, ~4,900-combination local word list)
residual risk rather than something requiring cross-machine locking.
Phase 3 itself is not yet implemented — this note exists so it starts from
the corrected scope rather than the original registry design.

**Phase 4 implementation:**
- `PRConfig.source_attribution` widened from `bool` to `bool | str`;
  `config.py` parses a case-insensitive `"codename"` string, falling back
  to `False` (never silently upgrading to the raw-marker `True` mode) for
  any other string value. `config_dropins._validate_pr` updated to accept
  either shape instead of a strict boolean.
- `attribution.build_codename_marker(codename)` emits
  `<!-- agent-worktrees:source codename=<name> -->` -- no other fields.
- Both marker-writing paths updated identically, per the Phase 4 checklist's
  explicit warning: `_open_via_provider` (initial `create-pr` body) and
  `refresh_source_attribution` (later-push refresh). Both skip the marker
  entirely (never downgrade to the raw marker) when the worktree
  unexpectedly has no assigned codename.
- Documented the three modes in `docs/config-reference.md` and
  `skills/worktree/references/pr-workflow.md`.
- Tests: 4 new (2 create-pr-path, 2 refresh-path) covering the codename
  marker's exact shape, absence of raw identifiers, and the no-codename
  skip case; 3 new config-parsing tests (accepted, case-insensitive,
  rejected-typo-falls-back-to-false); 4 new `config_dropins` validation
  tests. Full suite: 495 passed across `test_config.py`/`test_pr_ops.py`/
  `test_providers.py`/`test_codename*.py` (7 pre-existing + new).

Next: Phase 5 (close the branch-name leak class -- the actual open security
gap per this effort's own framing) and the descoped Phase 3 (SSH-based
reverse lookup, no new registry).

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 5 landed (branch-name leak class closed)

- `providers.attribution.validate_effective_head` hard-blocks (raises
  `BranchLeakError`) whenever `pr.source_attribution` isn't exactly `true`
  and the *effective* PR head about to be published contains the raw
  worktree id, the machine name, or an unresolved `{machine}`/
  `{worktree_id}` template marker. Wired into `create_pr` at the single
  point `feature_branch` is resolved -- covering the explicit `--branch`,
  live-active-PR-reuse, and rendered-`head_pattern` paths uniformly, and
  checked before the dry-run response and before both the refspec and
  snapshot push branches (and their shared re-run helper,
  `_push_existing_feature`) ever run. Returns a plain `{"success": False,
  "error": ...}` result -- never a warning that lets the push proceed.
- Config-only migration audit landed alongside it:
  `attribution.head_pattern_leak_risk`/`audit_source_attribution_risk`
  (distinguishes a genuinely absent `source_attribution` key from an
  explicit `false` in its finding text) and `pr_ops.audit_attribution_risk`,
  exposed as the `agent-worktrees attribution-audit` CLI command (config-only,
  no git/provider I/O; scans the active project's own resolved config). A
  review round caught that the audit path couldn't actually distinguish
  absent from explicit `false` in practice (config parsing normalizes both
  to `PRConfig.source_attribution is False`) -- added
  `PRConfig.source_attribution_configured` (set from raw-key presence in
  `_parse_pr`) so the audit's finding text is accurate.
- Tests: 31 new -- 7 on `validate_effective_head` + 6 on
  `audit_source_attribution_risk` (`test_providers.py`); 6 integration-style
  `create_pr` tests in `TestCreatePRBranchLeakGuard` (explicit `--branch`
  leak, `head_pattern` leak, `source_attribution: true` no-op,
  `codename`-mode still blocks, dry-run reports the block, safe-default
  regression); 5 in `TestAuditAttributionRisk` (`test_pr_ops.py`, including
  the genuinely-absent-key case); 2 in `test_config.py`
  (`source_attribution_configured` parsing); 5 CLI-level tests in
  `TestAttributionAuditCLI` (`test_pr_ops.py`, plain/JSON output modes +
  config-load-failure). Full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/
  `test_config.py` suite: 451 passed. (10 pre-existing `test_doctor.py`
  failures on `origin/main`, unrelated to this change, confirmed via
  `git stash` before touching anything.)
- Also bumped `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`'s top-level
  `metadata.version` (a separate, easy-to-miss requirement for any
  `agent-worktrees` change per `AGENTS.md`), caught by review.
- **Review round 2** caught a real gap in the guard's coverage: it only ran
  inside `create_pr`, but `finalize.push_changes` republishes
  `record.pr.branch` directly on every re-push (both the snapshot and
  refspec publish paths), and that branch can be set independently via
  `set-pr --branch` or simply predate this guard on an existing worktree.
  Reused `validate_effective_head` at that second publish boundary too
  (`_push_changes_pr` and `_push_changes_pr_refspec` in `finalize.py`), so a
  leaking recorded branch can no longer be (re)published through
  `push-changes` either. 2 new tests (`TestPRFinalizeAndPush`-adjacent,
  snapshot + refspec modes); full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/
  `test_config.py` suite: 453 passed.
- **Review round 3** caught that `validate_effective_head` only checked the
  LIVE `config.machine`, never the worktree's originally RECORDED
  `record.machine` (frozen at registration). After a machine rename or
  record migration, a reused-existing-PR head or a stale recorded branch
  embedding the OLD machine name would pass the check against the new live
  name. Widened `validate_effective_head`'s `machine` parameter to accept a
  tuple, and pass `(config.machine, record.machine)` from all three call
  sites (`create_pr`, and both `finalize.push_changes` publish paths). 5 new
  tests (2 unit on the tuple form in `test_providers.py`, 1 empty-string
  guard, 2 integration in `test_pr_ops.py` covering create_pr and
  push_changes after a simulated rename); full `test_pr_ops.py`/
  `test_providers.py`/`test_config.py` suite: 458 passed.
- **Review round 4** caught two more real gaps: (1)
  `PRConfig.source_attribution_configured`'s dataclass default of `True` was
  wrong for `_parse_pr`'s missing-`pr`-block early return (`PRConfig()`),
  which meant a repo with NO `pr:` block at all was reported as
  "explicitly false" instead of "absent" by the audit -- flipped the
  default to `False` (the safe/conservative reading for any manually
  constructed `PRConfig`, matching `_parse_pr`'s actual per-key behavior).
  (2) The audit's remedy text for `codename` mode told a repo already in
  codename mode to "migrate to codename" -- a no-op that leaves the risky
  `head_pattern` token in place, since codename mode only ever protects the
  PR-body marker, never the branch name. Reworded the remedy to distinguish
  absent / codename / other-false cases. 3 new/adjusted tests (1 config
  test for the missing-block path, a codename-remedy-wording assertion,
  and 3 existing audit tests updated to explicitly set
  `source_attribution_configured=True` where they exercise a genuinely
  "configured" scenario via direct dataclass construction rather than
  `_parse_pr`); full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/`test_config.py`
  suite: 459 passed.
- **Review round 5** caught a real gap (case-sensitive matching -- a branch
  like `user/Test/reused-head` passed against a recorded machine `test`)
  plus two documentation nits (the branch-name-leak paragraph only
  mentioned `create-pr`, not `push-changes`'s identical enforcement; the
  new `attribution-audit` command was missing from
  `docs/cli-reference.md`). Case-folded both the `worktree_id` and
  `machine` containment checks in `validate_effective_head`; updated both
  docs. 2 new unit tests (case-insensitive machine match, case-insensitive
  worktree-id match); full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/
  `test_config.py` suite: 461 passed.
- **Review round 6** caught that `_UNRESOLVED_TOKEN_RE` (shared by the
  runtime defensive check and the static `head_pattern_leak_risk` audit)
  only matched the bare `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}` token form --
  `pr_head_name` renders `head_pattern` via `str.format(**tokens)`, which
  also accepts conversion/format-spec variants (`{machine!s}`,
  `{machine:>10}`) that substitute the identical leaking value, so the
  static `attribution-audit` command silently under-reported such a
  pattern as safe. Broadened the regex to recognize those variants. 2 new
  tests (one on `validate_effective_head`'s defensive check, one on
  `head_pattern_leak_risk`/`audit_source_attribution_risk`); full
  `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/`test_config.py` suite: 463 passed.
- **Review round 7** caught that the static audit flagged `{worktree_id}`
  as a risky `head_pattern` token, but `pr_head_name`'s actual rendering
  contract is only `prefix`/`slug`/`suffix`/`username`/`machine` --
  `{worktree_id}` in a `head_pattern` raises inside `str.format` and falls
  back to the safe default, so it can never actually reach a published
  branch and flagging it was a false positive the audit could never
  observe at `create-pr` time. Split the static-audit token regex
  (`{machine}` only, the actually-renderable/risky token) from the
  runtime defensive "unresolved marker" regex used by
  `validate_effective_head` (unchanged: still checks `{worktree_id}` too,
  since that check guards an arbitrary chosen head string, not just a
  rendered `head_pattern`). Also fixed two documentation/docstring
  inaccuracies: the "Documentation impact" PR statement omitted
  `cli-reference.md`, and `cmd_attribution_audit`'s docstring said
  `--json` always exits 0 (a config-load failure exits 1 in both output
  modes). 3 tests rewritten to use `{machine}` instead of `{worktree_id}`
  as the risky-pattern fixture, 2 new tests
  (`{worktree_id}` never flagged alone; `{machine}` still flagged when
  paired with `{worktree_id}`); full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/
  `test_config.py` suite: 464 passed.
- **Review round 8** caught that the token-detection regex missed a NESTED
  replacement field inside a format spec (`{machine:{width}}` -- valid
  `str.format` syntax that still substitutes the leaking value, but a
  regex cannot reliably recognize arbitrary nesting). Replaced the regex
  entirely with `string.Formatter().parse()` -- the same parser
  `str.format` itself uses, so it can never miss (or misidentify) a field
  `str.format` would actually substitute -- for both
  `validate_effective_head`'s defensive unresolved-marker check and
  `head_pattern_leak_risk`'s static audit. Also corrected
  `pr_ops.audit_attribution_risk`'s docstring, which still said the audit
  flags `{machine}`/`{worktree_id}` (it only flags `{machine}`, per round
  7). 2 new tests (nested-spec unresolved-marker block, nested-spec
  static-audit finding); full `test_pr_ops.py`/`test_providers.py`/
  `test_config.py` suite: 466 passed.
- **Review round 9** caught that `string.Formatter.parse` itself only
  returns TOP-LEVEL field names -- a field nested inside a DIFFERENT
  field's `format_spec` (e.g. `{slug:{machine}}`, where `machine` is
  nested inside `slug`'s spec, not `machine`'s own) comes back embedded in
  that spec as literal text, not its own parse result, so round 8's fix
  still missed this one-level-removed nesting. Made `_referenced_field_names`
  recurse into every `format_spec` (at any depth) rather than inspecting
  only the top-level parse. Also fixed a Ruff F841 (unused `wt_path` in 6
  tests that never read it -- renamed to `_wt_path`). 2 new tests (one on
  `validate_effective_head`, one on the static audit, both using the
  nested-inside-a-different-field shape); full `test_pr_ops.py`/
  `test_providers.py`/`test_config.py` suite: 468 passed.

Remaining: Phase 3 (descoped SSH-based reverse lookup, not yet
rewritten/implemented). This effort is not `Done` until Phase 3 lands too.

### 2026-09-18 — Phase 3 landed (descoped SSH-based cross-machine reverse lookup)

- Rewrote the Phase 3 checklist (see above) to match the descoped design
  the operator steered toward earlier this session: no shared
  atomic-reservation registry, a direct SSH scan of each known machine's
  own local tracking store instead.
- New `codename_reverse_lookup.py`: `resolve_codename_cross_machine`
  (returns every match -- 0, 1, or, on a genuine collision, more than 1)
  and `resolve_codename_cross_machine_unique` (raises
  `AmbiguousCodenameError` rather than silently picking one). Fans out
  over SSH to every other known, Copilot-enabled, ssh-ready machine from
  `machines.yaml`, invoking a new `codename-lookup <codename> --json` CLI
  endpoint there (mirrors `claimant.py`'s `claimant-liveness` cross-machine
  reap-safety pattern byte-for-byte: same pwsh-EncodedCommand-on-Windows /
  `bash -lc`-elsewhere wrapping, same "every failure degrades silently"
  contract). Promoted `claimant._resolve_machine_ssh` to public
  `resolve_machine_ssh` (kept the private name as a back-compat alias for
  its own call site + existing tests) so both modules share one "resolve
  how to SSH to this machine key" helper instead of forking the logic.
- `resolve --codename` and the newly-added `embody --codename` (embody
  previously only accepted `--worktree-id`/`--new`) share
  `_resolve_codename_anywhere`: local match first (unchanged Phase 2
  behavior, no network call), then the cross-machine scan. A match on a
  **different** machine fails closed -- reports the resolving machine and
  worktree id, never attempts a remote launch -- the explicit choice the
  original checklist asked to make instead of an implicit agent-bridge
  delegation.
- Tests: 21 new in `test_codename_reverse_lookup.py` (machine enumeration,
  remote-probe command building + response parsing, the SSH probe itself,
  the scan + collision-detection), 8 new CLI-level tests in
  `test_cli_routing.py` (`codename-lookup`'s parser/registration/JSON/plain
  modes, `_resolve_codename_anywhere`'s four outcomes, `embody`'s
  fail-closed remote path), 1 new integration test in `test_codename_cli.py`
  (`embody --codename` same-machine round-trip, alongside the existing
  Phase-2 `resolve --codename` one). Full `test_pr_ops.py`-adjacent run
  plus the whole plugin suite: 639 passed (the same 10 pre-existing
  `test_doctor.py` failures, unrelated, confirmed against `origin/main`
  before this session started).
- Docs: `docs/cli-reference.md` (`resolve`/`embody` rows),
  `docs/config-reference.md` (`source_attribution` row),
  `skills/worktree/references/pr-workflow.md`, and
  `providers/attribution.py`'s module docstring all updated to describe
  the cross-machine scan instead of "not implemented yet."
- **Bonus fix, found while verifying the last unchecked Validation Plan
  item** (not part of Phase 3's own scope, but a genuine, if minor,
  pre-existing BEHAVIOR gap this session closed): `create_pr`
  (`_open_via_provider` in `pr_ops.py`) read `record.codename` and, when
  it was missing, deliberately SKIPPED the marker entirely (by design,
  never downgrading to the raw marker) -- it never called
  `codename_tracking.ensure_codename` to backfill one the way the
  `resolve`/`resume`/`status --write` touch paths do. A legacy worktree
  that newly enabled `codename` mode and went straight to `create-pr`
  (without an intervening `resolve`/`resume`/`status` touch) got no
  attribution marker on its first PR at all. Fixed: backfill in place
  (never reassigning `record` itself, which would silently detach it from
  `target_pr`'s later mutations) when the codename is genuinely missing;
  a present-but-malformed codename still skips unchanged (that safety
  behavior was intentional and untouched). 1 test rewritten
  (`test_codename_mode_backfills_a_missing_codename`, was
  `test_codename_mode_skips_marker_without_a_codename`) plus 2 sibling
  "skip" tests switched to a malformed (not missing) codename fixture so
  they keep exercising the still-skips-on-malformed path.

**This is the last Phase.** With Phase 3 landed, every Phase 3 checklist
item and every Phase 3 Validation Plan item -- including the pre-existing
Phase 4 item this session's verification pass caught and fixed -- is
checked off.

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 3 PR review round 1 (PR #2922)

- **Command injection (high severity):** `resolve_codename_cross_machine`
  passed the caller-supplied `codename` straight into `_remote_probe_cmd`,
  which interpolates it into a remote `bash -lc '...'` string (and a pwsh
  EncodedCommand payload) -- an unvalidated codename containing quotes or
  shell metacharacters could inject arbitrary commands on every scanned
  machine. Fixed: validate against `codename.is_valid_handle` (the same
  lowercase-alnum-plus-hyphens shape every legitimately-assigned codename
  already satisfies) BEFORE any SSH fan-out, returning `[]` for a
  malformed value -- exactly like "not found," never reaching the shell
  construction at all. 1 new test
  (`test_malformed_codename_never_reaches_ssh`, five injection-shaped
  payloads, asserts `_probe_machine` is never called).
- **Misleading comment (low severity):** the backfill fix's comment
  claimed `ensure_codename` "may return a freshly-reloaded object from
  disk" as the reason for mutating `record.codename` in place rather than
  reassigning `record`. That is factually wrong -- `ensure_codename`
  always mutates and returns the SAME `record` object it was given, never
  a different one. Simplified the code (dropped the now-pointless
  intermediate `backfilled` variable) and corrected the comment to
  describe the actual contract.
- Full plugin suite: 640 passed (same 10 pre-existing `test_doctor.py`
  failures, unrelated).

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 3 PR review round 2 (PR #2922)

- **Best-effort backfill (medium severity):** `codename_tracking.ensure_codename`
  can raise (notably `TimeoutError` if its cross-process allocation lock
  can't be acquired in time), and the new backfill call in
  `_open_via_provider` was unguarded -- a lock-contention failure would
  crash `create-pr`'s provider-open flow and abort opening the PR
  entirely, even though the codename marker itself is explicitly
  best-effort (a missing/invalid codename already degrades to "skip the
  marker," never a hard failure). Wrapped the backfill call in a bare
  `except Exception: pass` so any failure degrades to the same
  pre-existing skip behavior instead of propagating. 1 new test
  (`test_codename_backfill_failure_degrades_to_skip_not_crash`, mocks
  `ensure_codename` to raise `TimeoutError`, asserts the PR still opens
  successfully with no marker). Full plugin suite: 640 passed (same 10
  pre-existing `test_doctor.py` failures, unrelated).

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 3 PR review round 3 (PR #2922)

- **Explicit `project` argument also unvalidated (medium severity):**
  round 1's command-injection fix validated `codename` before the SSH
  fan-out, but an explicitly-supplied `project` argument to
  `resolve_codename_cross_machine` is interpolated into the same remote
  shell command and was left unvalidated -- a footgun for any future
  caller that threads untrusted project input into this API (the
  DEFAULT path, `project=None` resolved via the already-trusted
  `cfg.project_name()`, was never at risk). Fixed: validate an explicit
  `project` against `cfg._PROJECT_NAME_RE` (the same shape
  `cfg.project_name()`'s own resolution already enforces), degrading to
  `[]` on a malformed value -- consistent with the existing fail-soft
  contract. 2 new tests (malformed explicit `project` never reaches
  `_probe_machine`; a valid explicit `project` is still accepted). Full
  plugin suite: 642 passed (same 10 pre-existing `test_doctor.py`
  failures, unrelated).

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 3 PR review round 4 (PR #2922, unrelated CI blip + final polish)

- **Unrelated CI failure:** a concurrently-merged PR
  (`agent-dispatch`#2923, "reuse one persistent claims-management comment
  per issue/loop") added lines to
  `agent_dispatch/repository_issue_loops.py` without widening its own
  module-size baseline, which then failed THIS PR's CI once rebased onto
  the new `main` tip. Fixed the baseline in this PR (a `tools/`-only
  change, no plugin version bump required) since CI runs against the
  merged result regardless of which PR's change caused the drift.
- **Round 4 verdict: 🟢 Approval recommended.** One low-severity cosmetic
  finding remained: `embody`'s `--new`/`--worktree-id` mutual-exclusivity
  error message didn't mention the newly-added `--codename` selector
  (relevant since `--codename` resolves into the same `raw_id` that
  trips this check). Reworded for accuracy; no test asserted the old
  exact text, so no test changes needed. Full plugin suite: 642 passed
  (same 10 pre-existing `test_doctor.py` failures, unrelated).

### 2026-09-20 — Phase 3 PR review round 5 (PR #2922, rebase + type-safety fix)

- **Long gap, large rebase.** This PR sat open ~19 hours; `origin/main`
  advanced 6+ merges past its base, including two concurrent
  `agent-worktrees` version bumps and pre-existing (unrelated)
  module-size-baseline drift in `worktree-manager`'s picker engine.
  Rebased cleanly onto the new tip: resolved the version-bump conflicts
  by bumping past the new base version, kept the higher (already-correct)
  baseline values from `origin/main` over this branch's now-stale ones,
  and additionally fixed the pre-existing `picker_tui/engine.py` drift
  since CI checks the merged result regardless of origin.
- **Non-`str` explicit `project` (medium severity):** round 3's
  `project`-validation fix assumed `project` was already a `str` before
  regex-matching it against `cfg._PROJECT_NAME_RE` -- but the parameter's
  type hint (`str | None`) is not runtime-enforced, so a non-`str` value
  (an `int`, a `list`, ...) would raise a `TypeError` inside the match
  instead of degrading to `[]` (the fail-soft contract every other input
  path here honors). Added an `isinstance` guard before the regex check.
  1 new test (`test_non_string_explicit_project_degrades_to_empty`, four
  non-string types). Full plugin suite: 553 passed on the targeted
  codename/providers/pr_ops/cli_routing/claimant suites (25 new in
  `test_codename_reverse_lookup.py` alone); confirmed no new module-size
  or version-consistency regressions from the rebase.
