# Picker Venue Pivots (Codespaces & Containers) UX Overhaul

- **Slug:** `picker-venue-pivots`
- **Repo:** copilot-extensions
- **Branch(es):** Phase 0+1 landed via
  `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260921-183442-d733` (merged,
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3219`); Phase 2 (Containers) landed via
  `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260922-002606-0a9a` (merged,
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3268`); Phase 3 (Open action) landed via
  `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260922-022834-a59b` (merged,
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3279`); Phase 4 landed via
  `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260922-113718-4a4e` (merged,
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3285`); Phase 5 + Phase 4 follow-ups are
  in `worktree/operator-cloud1-win-20260922-123333-e9c8`. Each remaining phase
  or follow-up slice gets its own fresh worktree off `main`
  (Tasks-pane precedent).
- **Created:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Done; pending archive — Phases 0-5 are merged, the lingering
  unticked checklist items have now been reconciled, and the only host-level
  validation remainder is explicitly transferred to
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507`.
- **Vision:** [`visions/venue-pivots-ux`](../../../visions/venue-pivots-ux/README.md)
- **Umbrella issue:** `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3253`
- **Sub-issues:** Phase 1 `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3254` (closed),

  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3257`, Phase 5
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3258`; close-out follow-up transfer
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507`.

## Guiding Intent

**Both pivots already exist and are contributed by `agent-codespaces` and
`agent-containers` today** (`pivots/agent-codespaces.json`,
`pivots/agent-containers.json`) — this is an **overhaul of two existing,
asymmetric contributions**, not a greenfield build (an earlier draft of this
effort/vision got this wrong; see Journal). The CodeSpaces pivot is already
fairly rich (`pool.picker_payload`): repo-grouped, columnar
(health/occupancy/safety/worktree/cores), with gated Release/Recycle/Verify
actions. The Containers pivot is correctly scoped to **fleet** members only
(never a general Docker browser) but is far thinner: a flat badge list with
no columns, no grouping, no worktree cross-link, and no actions at all —
even though its own `fleet --json` output already carries a `lease` field
the manifest never surfaces.

This effort brings both pivots to consistent presentation and full
information fidelity:

1. **Codespaces:** wire the manifest's dropped `subtitle` field (claim
   holder / orphaned-lock detail `pool.py` already computes but the
   manifest never maps), and add the one genuinely new integration —
   an agent-bridge live-session join (title, latest reported
   progress/intent, liveness) via `LiveSessionInfo`/`LiveSessionVenue`.
2. **Containers:** bring the manifest up to the CodeSpaces pivot's fidelity
   — `columns`, fleet-based grouping, a `lease`→worktree cross-link, gated
   lifecycle actions — plus the same agent-bridge live-session join.
3. An **Open** action on either pivot (neither has one today) that attaches
   the operator to a live row's muxed Copilot instance over the fabric's SSH
   transport.
4. A reserved **driving-worktree mark** (a stat slot or the `[mark]` glyph)
   plus menu actions to jump to the driving worktree's Worktrees-pivot entry
   or open its Worktree Status card directly.
5. For example-repo: auto-journal a pushed-branch's resulting PR onto the
   driving worktree's existing claim ledger
   (`agent-worktrees claims add pr <ref>`), so it appears in the row's
   claims-list with no manual claim step.
6. Adopt a single **shared claims pecking order** (PR > bug > effort >
   bridge > CodeSpace/container > child worktree > machine SSH > dispatch
   task, tunable) for picking the "1-2 prominent" claims every pivot's
   claims-list shows — one ranking, every claim-showing pivot consumes it
   the same way.
7. **Design only** for this effort: "New codespace" / "New container" /
   "New agent"-on-a-dormant-venue, provision-then-embody. Per operator
   decision (2026-09-21), the interactive create→embody implementation is
   deferred to land alongside the parallel drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH
   capability, so this effort produces the design and the manifest/action
   shape but does not have to land a working provisioning flow itself.

See the vision for the full design intent; this effort tracks its
realization.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| operator-cloud1 (this session) | Grounding against real code, vision + effort authoring, preview-rendering tooling, Phase 1+ implementation | `copilot-extensions.worktrees/operator-cloud1-win-20260921-183442-d733` |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** independent per-phase PRs once the Phase 0 preview is
  approved by the operator — each Plan phase below is a self-contained,
  reviewable slice. Land each phase's PR before starting the next phase's
  implementation, per the Tasks-pane effort's own hard-won sequencing rule
  (`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#2908`).
- **Host (owns PRs):** whichever worktree lands each phase.
- **Delegates:** none yet.
- **Handoff:** the preview tooling and captured screenshots in this
  worktree are the artifact the operator reviews before any implementation
  PR opens. Implementation follows the same manual sequenced-session
  handoff loop the Tasks-pane effort used: a session drives until context
  fills, saves a handoff prompt, and a fresh session picks up from the
  Runbook below.

## Runbook — for whichever session is currently driving this effort

**Read this section FIRST in any new session picking up this effort.**

- **Worktree:** Phase 0+1 (`operator-cloud1-win-20260921-183442-d733`, PR
  #3219), Phase 2 (`operator-cloud1-win-20260922-002606-0a9a`, PR #3268),
  Phase 3 (`operator-cloud1-win-20260922-022834-a59b`, PR #3279), Phase 4
  (`operator-cloud1-win-20260922-113718-4a4e`, PR #3285), and Phase 5 design
  closeout (`operator-cloud1-win-20260922-123333-e9c8`) are merged. This
  session is in the fresh follow-up worktree
  `operator-cloud1-win-20260922-154146-755b` for the live-validation-discovered
  Phase 4 example-repo PR auto-claim bugfix.
- **Current phase:** Phases 0-5 are **fully complete**. This close-out pass
  reconciled the effort README's last stale unticked checklist items: one
  genuinely missing manifest-regression test was added, the already-existing
  Containers/Codespaces coverage was cited and revalidated, the real
  CodeSpaces pivot was rechecked against live `agent-codespaces pool
  --picker-json` output, and the Docker-dependent Containers live checks were
  explicitly transferred to `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507` after this
  machine could not start Docker Desktop unattended. This effort is now fully
  and completely closed out **as an effort**: no Plan/Validation checkbox in
  this README remains unreconciled, and the only residual venue-validation
  work is now outside this effort under `#3507`.
- **Umbrella + sub-issues filed** (2026-09-21):
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3253` (umbrella), `#3254`/`#3255`
  (closed -- Phase 1/2 landed), `#3256`-`#3258` (Phase 3-5, open).
- **Phase 1 complete and merged (PR #3219):** wired `claims_summary`/
  `entry.subtitle` into the Codespaces pivot and added the agent-bridge
  live-session join (`sess` column + transient-activity subtitle half).
  See the Plan's own Phase 1 checklist for full detail.
- **Phase 2 complete and merged (PR #3268):** brought the Containers pivot
  to the same fidelity (columns/group/worktree cross-link/subtitle/claims/
  live-session join, gated Stop/Remove actions) via a new
  `agent_containers/picker.py` module. See the Plan's own Phase 2
  checklist for full detail.
- **Phase 3 complete and merged (PR #3279):** added the
  picker-engine `open-venue` internal action (worktree-manager) backing
  both pivots' new Open action -- see the Plan's own Phase 3 checklist and
  the Journal below for the full grounding (the real gap was
  picker-engine-side: no existing action kind could hand off a genuine
  interactive TTY to a remote venue). 12 new tests; full worktree-manager
  suite green (1 pre-existing unrelated flake confirmed by isolated
  re-run) plus the real-manifest contract test.
- **Immediate next step:** land this close-out PR and archive this effort. The
  Phase 5 design note is recorded at
  [`phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md`](phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md)
  and cross-linked to
  [`agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`](../agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions/README.md);
  it is input to that parallel implementation effort, not further work here.
  The Phase 4 preview follow-up is also now resolved conclusively: a fresh
  re-render is pixel-identical to the committed approved PNGs, and the
  byte-only drift comes from the PNG IDAT stream encoding, not a visual
  regression, so the committed `design-previews/*.png` remain unchanged. The
  only residual venue-validation work is the explicit transfer
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507`, which no longer blocks retiring this
  effort itself.

## Context

The Worktrees pane and the Tasks pane (via
`agent-dispatch-tasks-pane-ux-overhaul`) already carry a disciplined
declarative-column, colour-palette, rich-action-menu presentation, and the
underlying two-line-row grammar (`RegisteredPivot.subtitle_field` +
`WorktreesView._row`/`_column_subtitle`) is already generic infrastructure
any pivot can use. **Both CodeSpaces and Containers already contribute
registered pivots** using that infrastructure, but at very different levels
of fidelity — see "Concepts grounded against real code" below for the exact
gap, cited to source. This effort closes that gap and adds the one piece
neither pivot has: a join against agent-bridge's live-session state.

## Request

Operator request (2026-09-21, paraphrased/public-safe): note that
`agent-codespaces` and `agent-containers` **already have** pivot
contributions — the ask is to **overhaul** those existing contributions to
align with where the system is currently going, and to ensure **consistency
of presentation** and **fidelity of information**, not to build new pivots
from nothing. Converge both on a two-line row (id/status/key-status/claims,
then a description). For Codespaces: repo is the key identity; also track
the locally-driving worktree and remote Copilot session info (title,
reported intent/progress, other status) via agent-bridge. For Containers:
split "fleet" (repo-shaped agent venues) from general Docker containers,
focusing on the Codespace-like agent-venue containers, not general
build/validation use. Support "New container"/"New codespace" provisioning
that launches the operator into a Copilot session through that venue (this
piece: design now, implement alongside the parallel
drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH effort). Most important end state: navigate to
this pivot, see an entry for an embodied agent, and Open it into the muxed
Copilot instance over SSH — the same flow for a fresh "New
codespace"/"New agent" against a dormant venue. Use an effort, and use the
preview-as-we-work screenshot approach (the Worktree Picker and the new
Tasks pivot are the baselines).

## Design Previews (approved north-star)

**Committed, not just filed on OneDrive** (2026-09-21 operator decision —
the Tasks-pane-ux effort's own previews only ever lived at
`OneDrive/2026/09.17 agent-dispatch Tasks Pane UX Overhaul Previews`, never
in-repo; this effort corrects that so the approved design has a durable,
version-controlled reference point future sessions can diff against for
drift, not just a local human-reviewed folder). These six PNGs
(`design-previews/`) are the **Phase 0-approved rendering** of the row
grammar, session column, claims list, and action menus — regenerate them
with `render_venue_preview.py` (see the venue-preview README) at any later
implementation checkpoint and diff against these committed copies to catch
visual regression or drift from the agreed design before merging. A
deliberate difference is fine (design evolves) — an *accidental* one is
what this comparison exists to catch. Update these files, with a Journal
note explaining why, whenever the design is deliberately revised.

## Concepts grounded against real code (do not re-derive; cite this)

- **Pivot registry contract:** `RegisteredPivot`/`Column`/`PivotAction` in
  `worktree-manager/src/worktree_manager/production_picker/picker_tui/
  pivot_manifest.py` and `pivots.py`; a contributing plugin drops a
  `pivots/<name>.json` template, `ensure_pivots`/`scan_pivot_registry`
  materialize an attributed pointer, the picker renders a generic pivot.
- **The two-line/subtitle grammar already exists and is already used by
  each pivot differently.** `RegisteredPivot.subtitle_field` defaults from
  `entry.subtitle` (`pivot_manifest.py`); `WorktreesView._row` (badge-list
  mode) and `_column_subtitle` (columns mode) both render it as a dim
  second line when present. Containers' manifest declares
  `"subtitle": "image"` (so it renders); **Codespaces' manifest does not
  declare `entry.subtitle` at all**, even though `pool.picker_payload`
  computes a rich `subtitle` (claim holder / cross-machine hold /
  orphaned-lock warning) on every entry — that computed value is silently
  dropped today. Column fit/priority (`Column.priority` +
  `TasksView._fitted_columns()`, landed alongside the Tasks-pane effort)
  is separate, already-generic infrastructure this effort reuses as-is.
- **CodeSpaces pivot, current real shape** (`pivots/agent-codespaces.json` +
  `pool.py`): `list = ["agent-codespaces", "pool", "--picker-json"]`,
  `scope: account`, `stream: true`; `entry` maps `id`/`title=display`/
  `worktree`/`group` (no `subtitle` — the gap above); `columns` = codespace/
  health/occupancy/safe/worktree/cores/task(`worktree_title`, populated by
  the picker engine's own `_worktree_title_map`, not agent-bridge); actions
  = Release (gated `disposition=in-use`), Recycle (gated
  `disposition=stale, safe=yes`), Verify (gated
  `disposition=stale, safe∈{unknown,no}`). `pool.picker_payload`'s full
  entry dict additionally carries `repository`/`repo`/`branch`/`account`/
  `disposition`/`state`/`running`/`holder`/`orphaned` — more than the
  current manifest surfaces; some of this is candidate material for new
  columns.
- **Containers pivot, current real shape**
  (`pivots/agent-containers.json` + `agent_containers.__main__._cmd_fleet`):
  `list = ["agent-containers", "fleet", "--json"]`; `entry` maps
  `id=name`/`title=name`/`subtitle=image`/`badges=[state, fleet]`; **no
  `columns`, no `group`, no `worktree` cross-link, no `actions` at all**.
  `_cmd_fleet`'s real JSON row (per `test_fleet_json.py`) already carries
  `name`, `container_id`, `image`, `state`, `status`, `fleet`,
  `local_folder`, `lease` (holder — the direct Containers analogue of
  Codespaces' `holder`/`worktree`), `security_profile`,
  `configured_security_profile`, `security_policy_current`,
  `security_policy_errors`, `network`, `environment_names`,
  `host_credentials`, `lifecycle_hold`, `rescue` — the manifest maps only
  4 of these ~16 fields today.
- **agent-bridge owns live-session state, and neither pivot joins it
  today:** `models.py`'s `LiveSessionInfo` (`worktree_id`, `repo`,
  `driven_by`, `status`, `turn_state`, `liveness`, `latest_progress`) and
  `LiveSessionVenue` (`kind: "codespace"|"container"`, `target`,
  `mux_session_name`) already carry everything a remote-session-join
  feature needs — confirmed **absent** from both current manifests and
  from `pool.py`/`_cmd_fleet`'s output. **No new agent-bridge schema is
  expected** — this effort is a consumer, not a schema owner.
- **"Bridges" pivot already exists** (`plugins/agent-bridge/pivots/
  agent-bridge.json`) but lists registered **bridge agent profiles**
  (`admin_resolver`-style targets), not live sessions or venues — a
  different subject from this effort's Codespaces/Containers pivots. Do not
  conflate or merge them.
- **`report_intent`-style progress:** the phrase does not appear literally
  in agent-bridge; the closest real mechanism is `LiveSessionInfo
  .latest_progress` (a parsed progress-beat object, "the live-session
  analogue of a task's `latest_progress`" per its own docstring) plus
  whatever a session's own reported title surfaces through
  `RegisterLiveSessionRequest`/session registration. Confirm the exact
  title/intent field names against `db_live_sessions.py` /
  `live_representation.py` during Phase 1 grounding rather than assuming a
  field name from this README.
- **Claims are an existing per-worktree ledger, not a new store:**
  `agent-worktrees`' `claims_cli.py` already implements
  `claims add <kind> <ref>` (kinds already include `pr`, `codespace`,
  `container`), `claims release`/`settle`/`sweep`. This effort's
  claims-list column reads that ledger through the driving-worktree
  cross-link — **no new claim storage or rendering**; the only new piece
  is a *producer* (Phase 4's example-repo PR auto-claim) calling the existing
  `claims add pr <ref>` verb.
- **example-repo PR detection has no existing hook yet:** nothing in
  `agent-codespaces` today watches for a pushed ADO branch turning into a
  PR (`codespace_assets/ado-auth-helper-relay`/`ado-auth-helper-wrapper`
  handle ADO *auth*, not PR detection). Phase 4 needs to design this
  detection point from scratch — likely a periodic/triggered check inside
  the CodeSpace's own git activity or an ADO API poll — before it can call
  the existing `claims add pr` verb.
- **No prominent-claims-selection code existed before this effort:**
  confirmed (grep across `engine.py`/`pivot_manifest.py`) — the
  Tasks-pane-ux vision's own "Prominent Artifacts" feature has never been
  implemented, and no other pivot picked "1-2 prominent" claims out of a
  fuller ledger. **Now implemented:**
  `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/claims_rank.py`
  (`rank_claims`/`format_claim`/`summarize_claims`) — pure functions over
  `ResourceClaim`-shaped entries, no I/O, 13 passing unit tests
  (`tests/test_claims_rank.py`). Placed in `agent-worktrees` since it
  already owns the ledger being ranked; both this effort's pivots and a
  future Tasks-pane-ux implementation import the same module rather than
  each computing their own selection. **Grounded gap recorded in the
  module's own docstring:** `claims_cli._claims_add`'s `valid_kinds` today
  is only `{worktree, codespace, container, ssh, workdir, pr, task}` —
  "bug"/"issue", "effort", "bridge" are not yet claimable kinds; the
  module ranks whatever is actually present and degrades gracefully
  (unrecognized kinds sort last, never raise) rather than assuming those
  kinds exist.
- **The pecking order is itself now a `.d/` drop-in registry, mirroring
  the Picker's own pivot-contribution pattern:**
  `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/claim_kinds_registry.py`
  scans every installed plugin's own `claim-kinds/*.json`
  (`{"kind", "priority", "label"?}`) and merges the contributions onto
  `claims_rank.DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER`. Deliberately lighter than the pivot
  registry's own contract (no identity verification, no legacy migration,
  no separate materialized-runtime-directory step) — a claim-kind
  declaration carries no executable command to spoof, so that machinery's
  reason to exist doesn't apply. `claims_rank` gained optional
  `pecking_order=`/`label_overrides=` parameters so it stays pure/I/O-free
  while still consuming a plugin's contributions (the registry module does
  the scanning; `claims_rank` never touches a filesystem). 12 new tests,
  all passing (28 total across both modules).
- **The row grammar needs zero new picker-engine code — confirmed by
  building the Phase 0 preview.** `subtitle_field`/`_column_subtitle`
  already render one composed string; `Column`/`group_field`/
  `worktree_field` already exist. Every proposed field in the Phase 0
  manifests (`sess`, `claims_summary`, the composed `subtitle`) is just a
  new column/entry-mapping declaration plus a new value the real backend
  command (`pool.py`, `_cmd_fleet`) would compute — exactly the same shape
  as the existing `worktree_title` auto-injection. The preview's own
  fixtures bake the agent-bridge join's *output* (`sess`, the composed
  activity text) directly into the fixture rows rather than modeling a
  separate `agent-bridge live-sessions --json` fixture and a join step in
  the preview tooling — that join is real Phase 1/2 backend work
  (`pool.py`/`_cmd_fleet` calling agent-bridge), not something the picker
  engine or this preview tool needs to simulate to prove the row grammar.
- **The Worktrees pane already has the exact column this effort needs for
  session liveness:** a compact `sess`/`live` column (key `sess`, header
  "live", 4 chars wide) with a multi-valued vocabulary (a pulsing "●" for a
  live mux, `PROC`/`LOCK` otherwise) — not a boolean. An operator review of
  the first-draft screenshots correctly flagged this effort's own `driven`
  column as too wide for what amounts to a yes/no, and pointed at this
  existing column as the right model. Adopted directly: same key/header/
  width, values `LIVE`/`IDLE`/blank. The separate `driven` boolean is
  **dropped entirely** — it was redundant with the already-present
  `worktree` cross-link column (non-blank already means driven).

### Design note: New-venue entry point (Phase 1 closure, design-only)

Grounded (2026-09-21) against `pivot_manifest.py`: the pivot-registry
contract has **no notion of a pivot-level action** — every `PivotAction`
in a manifest's `actions` list is inherently per-*entry* (its `run` command
interpolates `{id}`/other row fields, and its `when` clause gates against
that row's own field values). There is no "always show this action once,
regardless of row count" concept, and no defined behavior for an action on
an *empty* pivot (0 entries -> 0 rows -> 0 opportunities to attach a
per-entry action). This means "New codespace" cannot be expressed as a
`pivots/agent-codespaces.json` snippet today, contradicting the Phase 1
checklist's original "manifest/action shape only" framing (Phase 0 never
actually produced such a snippet either — the proposed manifest has no
"New codespace" action).

Closing this out as **design-only, with a named gap** rather than
inventing an ad hoc mechanism: a genuine "New codespace"/"New container"/
"New agent" implementation needs a **pivot-registry schema addition** (a
pivot-level, row-independent action slot) before it can be expressed
declaratively at all — that schema work belongs to whichever effort
actually implements the create→embody flow (deferred per this effort's own
Guiding Intent item 7, to land alongside the parallel
drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH capability), not this effort. The flow's own
*behavior* (prompt for target info, provision, hand off into a fresh
embodied Copilot session) is already recorded in the vision's own
"New codespace / New container — provision, then embody" section; this
note's contribution is the concrete engine-level gap discovered while
trying to scope it as a manifest change.

### Phase 5 design note: finalized create→embody handoff

The finalized design note for the deferred New-venue flow now lives in
[`phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md`](phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md).
It makes explicit that this effort owns only the picker-side UX contract
(target-info prompt → provider-specific provision call → hand-off into the
already-existing venue `copilot` path), while
[`agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`](../agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions/README.md)
owns the reusable remote CLI-mode embodiment machinery the hand-off lands on.

## Plan

### Phase 0 — Design + review-ready previews (this worktree)
- [x] Ground the pivot-registry contract, agent-codespaces' lifecycle
      surface, agent-containers' fleet/generic split, and agent-bridge's
      `LiveSessionInfo`/`LiveSessionVenue` model against the real code.
- [x] Author the `venue-pivots-ux` vision.
- [x] Author this effort README.
- [x] **Correction pass:** re-grounded against the actual
      `pivots/agent-codespaces.json`/`pivots/agent-containers.json`
      manifests and `pool.py`/`_cmd_fleet` source after an operator
      correction that both pivots already exist; reframed vision + effort
      from "build two new pivots" to "overhaul two existing, asymmetric
      pivots."
- [x] Confirm the exact agent-bridge field(s) backing "session title" and
      "reported intent/progress" (`live_representation.py`,
      `db_live_sessions.py`) — resolved in the "Concepts grounded against real
      code" section above (`LiveSessionInfo.latest_progress` with
      `{"phase", "summary"}`) and then used in the 2026-09-21
      **latest+8** / **latest+9** Journal entries that landed the Phase 1
      live-session join.
- [x] Stand up `scripts/picker-snapshot/venue-preview/`: hermetic demo
      Worktrees source (reuse `render_tasks_preview.py`'s pattern), fixed
      fixtures for `agent-codespaces pool --picker-json` and
      `agent-containers fleet --json` (`fake_pool.py`/`fake_fleet.py`), and
      **both a byte-copy of the real current manifest and a proposed
      manifest** for each pivot (not from-scratch proposals) — see
      `worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/venue-preview/README.md`.
- [x] Design the exact column/field mapping for the Containers parity pass
      and the Codespaces `subtitle` wiring, realized directly as the two
      `*.proposed.json` manifests (not just a prose note): a compact
      `sess` (session liveness) column and a `claims` column on both,
      `subtitle` composed as
      `"[mark] <durable title> - <transient activity>"`, a `worktree`
      cross-link on Containers via `lease`.
- [x] Decide the driving-worktree indicator's slot: **dropped the
      dedicated `driven` boolean entirely** (redundant with the already-
      present `worktree` cross-link column) after operator review of the
      first-draft screenshots; replaced with the Worktrees pane's own
      compact `sess`/`live` column (same key/header/4-char width,
      `LIVE`/`IDLE`/blank) for the one genuinely new signal — session
      liveness. "View driving worktree"/"Worktree status" menu entries
      gated on `sess` being `LIVE` or `IDLE`.
- [x] Design **and implement** the shared claims-pecking-order module:
      `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/claims_rank.py`
      (`rank_claims`/`format_claim`/`summarize_claims`), pure functions over
      `ResourceClaim`-shaped entries (objects or plain dicts), no I/O.
      13 unit tests, all passing (`tests/test_claims_rank.py`). Grounded
      against the real `valid_kinds` vocabulary while building it — "bug"/
      "issue", "effort", "bridge" are not yet claimable kinds; the module
      degrades gracefully (unrecognized kinds rank last, never raise) — see
      the module's own docstring for the full gap note. **Still preview-only
      placeholders**: `fake_pool.py`/`fake_fleet.py`'s `claims_summary`
      values are hand-authored, not wired to the real module yet — Phase 1/2
      wire `pool.py`/`_cmd_fleet` to actually call `summarize_claims`.
- [x] **Operator-proposed extension:** a `.d/` drop-in registry so any
      plugin can contribute a new claimable kind + priority without editing
      `claims_rank.py` — mirroring the Picker's own pivot-contribution
      pattern. Implemented as
      `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/claim_kinds_registry.py`
      (scans `<plugin_root>/claim-kinds/*.json` across every installed
      plugin, merges onto `claims_rank.DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER`); `claims_rank`
      gained `pecking_order=`/`label_overrides=` parameters to consume the
      merged result while staying pure/I/O-free itself. 12 new tests, all
      passing (28 total across both modules, including an end-to-end test
      proving a plugin-contributed kind actually re-ranks and re-labels a
      claim with no `claims_rank.py` code change).
- [x] Render and review before/after screenshots for both pivots: current
      (real) shape vs. proposed shape (`codespaces-before/after.png`,
      `containers-before/after.png`), plus a menu screenshot for each
      showing Open/View-driving-worktree/Worktree-status
      (`codespaces-menu-driven-live.png`, `containers-menu-driven-live.png`).
      All six ran successfully against the real Textual engine on the
      first attempt — see the venue-preview README for the full
      before/after description of each.
- [x] Operator review of the screenshots; resolve any design feedback here
      before Phase 1 starts. **Approved 2026-09-21** (after the
      `driven`→`sess` column fix — see Journal); committed as
      `design-previews/*.png` (see the section near the top of this
      README) as the durable north-star reference for future
      visual-regression/vision-alignment checks.

### Phase 1 — Codespaces pivot (implementation)
- [x] ~~Build the shared claims-pecking-order module~~ — done in Phase 0
      (`claims_rank.py`, see above). **Done (2026-09-21):** wired
      `pool.py`'s `picker_payload` to actually call
      `claims_rank.summarize_claims` (via a new
      `_claims_summary_for_worktree` helper, lazy-imported like `config
      ._registered_repo_paths`) against the claiming worktree's real claim
      ledger for its `claims_summary` entry field, replacing the preview's
      hand-authored placeholder strings. 3 new tests, all passing.
- [x] Wire `entry.subtitle` into `pivots/agent-codespaces.json` so
      `pool.picker_payload`'s already-computed subtitle (claim/orphan
      detail) actually renders as the durable-title half of line two.
      **Done (2026-09-21)**, alongside a new `claims_summary` column
      (matching the approved proposed-manifest width/priority).
- [x] Add any additional columns worth surfacing from `pool.picker_payload`'s
      fuller entry dict (per Phase 0 design note). **Resolved (2026-09-21):**
      no further column beyond `sess`/`claims_summary` was actually
      identified in Phase 0's design artifacts (the proposed manifest adds
      only those two) — nothing else to add.
- [x] agent-bridge live-session join keyed on
      `venue.kind == "codespace"` + `venue.target`, surfaced as the
      transient-activity half of line two. **Done (2026-09-21):** added
      `_bridge_client_from_env`/`_live_session_for_venue`/`_sess_column`/
      `_activity_from_live_session` to `pool.py` (a hand-rolled, silent
      variant of `BridgeClient.from_config()` -- that classmethod prints +
      `sys.exit(1)`s on a missing auth token, which is wrong for an inline
      pool-listing call; this degrades to `None` instead). Grounded
      `latest_progress`'s exact shape (`{"phase", "summary"}`) against
      `inventory_cli._live_session_summary_line` and liveness values
      (`"active"`/`"stalled"`/`"idle"`/`None`) against
      `routes.live_sessions._live_liveness` — the open Phase 0 grounding
      item is now resolved. 8 new tests.
- [x] (Manifest/action shape only, per Phase 0 design) the New-codespace
      entry point. **Resolved as design-only (2026-09-21):** see "Design
      note: New-venue entry point" below — the current pivot-registry
      contract (`pivot_manifest.py`) has **no concept of a pivot-level
      action independent of a row** (every `PivotAction` is per-entry,
      gated by that entry's own `when` clause), so "New codespace" cannot
      be expressed as a manifest/action snippet today without a schema
      change. Recorded as a genuine gap for whichever effort implements the
      real create→embody flow (per this effort's own Guiding Intent item 7,
      deferred alongside the parallel drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH capability)
      rather than invented here.

### Phase 2 — Containers pivot (implementation)
- [x] Add `columns` to `pivots/agent-containers.json` mirroring
      Codespaces' shape (container/fleet, state, lease→worktree, and
      whatever `security_profile`/`network` signal is picker-worthy per
      Phase 0 design). **Done (2026-09-22):** matches the approved
      `agent-containers.proposed.json` preview manifest exactly (container/
      fleet/state/sess/lease→worktree/security_profile/worktree_title/
      claims_summary); dropped the now-redundant `badges` (state/fleet are
      real columns now).
- [x] Add fleet-based `group` (the Containers analogue of "repo @
      account"). **Done:** `entry.group = "fleet"` -- the raw `fleet` field
      `_cmd_fleet` already emits, no new computed value needed (unlike
      Codespaces' `repo @ account`, which Containers' single-axis fleet
      grouping doesn't require).
- [x] Wire the existing `lease` field to a `worktree` cross-link exactly
      as Codespaces already does. **Done:** `entry.worktree = "lease"` --
      again the raw field directly, no derived-field indirection needed.
- [x] Wire Containers' claims-list column to the same `claims_rank` module
      Phase 1 wires — no second implementation. **Done:** new
      `agent_containers.picker.claims_summary_for_worktree` imports
      `agent_worktrees.claims_rank`/`claim_kinds_registry` exactly like
      agent-codespaces' `pool._claims_summary_for_worktree` (duplicated
      glue, shared module -- no plugin-to-plugin Python import exists
      between agent-containers and agent-codespaces themselves).
- [x] Add gated lifecycle actions analogous to Release/Recycle/Verify,
      built on `lifecycle.py`/`lease.py`/`rescue.py`'s existing
      start/stop/remove/rescue primitives. **Done:** added single-container
      `agent-containers stop <name>`/`remove <name>` CLI subcommands
      (`_cmd_stop`/`_cmd_remove` in `__main__.py`), wired to `lifecycle.py`'s
      existing `stop_container`/`remove_container` primitives -- the
      per-container analogue of `down`/`rm`'s existing whole-fleet scope.
      Both refuse a leased container (same "settle the claim first"
      discipline `down_fleet`/`remove_fleet` already apply). Manifest gates
      Stop on `state == "running"` and Remove on `state == "exited"`,
      matching the approved proposed manifest.
- [x] Same agent-bridge live-session join as Phase 1, joined on
      `venue.kind == "container"`. **Done:** new `agent_containers.picker`
      module (`bridge_client_from_env`/`live_session_for_venue`/
      `sess_column`/`activity_from_live_session`/`subtitle_for`/
      `picker_fields`) -- duplicated logic from agent-codespaces' `pool.py`
      equivalents (no shared glue module between the two independent
      plugins, consistent with how both already vendor their own separate
      `copilot_venue.py`). Unlike Codespaces (a dedicated `--picker-json`
      shape), Containers' manifest reuses the plain `fleet --json` output
      directly (per the approved Phase 0 design), so `_cmd_fleet` itself
      merges `picker.picker_fields(name, lease)`'s 3 new fields
      (`subtitle`/`claims_summary`/`sess`) onto each row.
      `test_fleet_json_emits_bare_array_with_expected_fields`'s exact-field-
      set assertion updated to include them -- a deliberate, tracked schema
      growth on that command's existing consumers, not an accidental break.
      12 new tests (`test_picker.py` + `test_fleet_json.py` +
      `test_cli_operations.py`); full agent-containers suite green apart
      from 7 pre-existing, unrelated Windows-POSIX-permission/bash failures
      (confirmed present pre-change via `git stash`/`git stash pop`).

### Phase 3 — Open into a muxed session over SSH
- [x] Add an Open action to both pivots (neither has one today), wired to
      the existing `mux_session_name` reattach mechanics for a live row.
      **Done (2026-09-22):** grounded against the newly-built
      `agent-codespaces copilot <name>` / `agent-containers copilot <name>`
      verbs (`copilot_venue.py` + the shared vendored `venue_copilot` lib) --
      these already implement reserve/ensure-mux/attach-or-embody uniformly
      for a live *or* dormant venue, so no new remote-side plumbing was
      needed. The real gap was **picker-engine-side**: a plain manifest
      `run` action executes its subprocess in a background thread and
      captures output (no real TTY), and the existing `open-cli` internal
      action explicitly rejects any row whose `source_kind` isn't
      `"machine-ssh"` (a local/SSH worktree only) -- neither could carry an
      interactive remote Copilot session. Added a new picker-engine
      internal action, `open-venue` (worktree-manager, not
      agent-codespaces/agent-containers): `_task_action_ctx` now derives
      `ctx["provider"]` from the registered pivot's own `list` argv[0]
      (`"agent-codespaces"`/`"agent-containers"` -- no hardcoded provider
      list); `_internal_pivot_action`'s new `_open_venue` builds an
      `{"action": "open-venue", "provider", "venue", "title"}` decision and
      exits the picker (the same exit-and-launch plumbing `open-cli` uses);
      `worktree_manager/__main__.py`'s `_run_production_picker` maps it onto
      a new `launcher.open_venue(provider, venue)` (resolves the provider
      binstub via `PATH`, then `subprocess.run([binstub, "copilot", venue])`
      with inherited stdio -- the real-TTY handoff). Wired
      `{"label": "Open", "kind": "internal", "verb": "open-venue"}` into
      both `pivots/agent-codespaces.json` and `pivots/agent-containers.json`
      -- **ungated** (no `when` clause): the venue's own `copilot` verb
      already handles a live-or-dormant venue uniformly, so there is no
      separate "live-only" case to gate on. `worktree_manager/__main__.py`
      was already at its own module-size-baseline ceiling (zero headroom,
      same class of constraint Phase 2 hit in agent-containers) --
      extracted a genuinely duplicated `machine`/`environment` resolution
      (the "resume"/"new" branches built the identical pair inline) into a
      new `_remote_machine_env` helper to make real room, rather than
      widening the baseline from this PR's own diff. 12 new tests across
      `test_picker_tui.py`/`test_production_picker_transplant.py`/
      `test_launcher.py`; full worktree-manager suite green (1093 tests,
      1 pre-existing unrelated flake confirmed by isolated re-run) plus
      `test_plugin_contracts.py::test_real_checkout_manifests_match_contract`
      (validates both real manifests against the pivot-registry contract).
- [x] Confirm behavior parity with the Worktrees pane's own Open/resume
      action for a row with no live session (resumable but dormant venue).
      **Confirmed by design, not just observation:** `venue_copilot
      .run_venue_copilot` reserves + ensures the mux + attaches-or-embodies
      unconditionally -- there is no live/dormant branch in the verb itself,
      so parity is structural (the same command runs either way), not a
      coincidence of testing.

### Phase 4 — Driving-worktree navigation + example-repo PR auto-claim
- [x] Implement the reserved driving-worktree mark on both pivots (stat
      slot or `[mark]` glyph per Phase 0 decision) and its two menu
      actions: jump to the driving worktree's Worktrees-pivot entry, and
      open its Worktree Status card directly. **Done (2026-09-22):** both
      manifests now surface Phase 4's two drill-in verbs gated on an
      explicit `has_driving_worktree` row field, reusing the existing
      `jump-host` internal picker action plus a row-supplied
      `worktree_status` card payload. Because `jump-host` resolves by full
      tracked id (not the short/beacon token already shown in the row's
      worktree column), venue rows now carry a separate `worktree_id`
      drill-in field and the picker's internal action dispatch falls back
      to it before the display-side `worktree` token. Codespaces prefixes
      the second line with the reserved `→` mark whenever a row is backed
      by a resolvable local driving worktree; Containers uses the same
      field/mark contract through `picker_fields`.
- [x] Confirm the claims-list column already reads the driving worktree's
      existing `agent-worktrees` claim ledger with no new storage (should
      require no new code beyond the existing cross-link, per Phase 1/2).
      **Confirmed:** no new ledger/store was added. Phase 4 continues to
      read the same Phase 1/2 `claims_summary` cross-link via
      `agent_worktrees.claims_rank`; only a new producer (`journal_claim`
      -> existing `claims add pr`) feeds it.
- [x] Design and implement the example-repo push→PR detection point (new: no
      existing hook watches for this) that calls
      `agent-worktrees claims add pr <ref>` on the driving worktree when a
      CodeSpace's pushed ADO branch produces a PR. **Done:** detection is a
      best-effort, read-triggered probe in `pool.picker_payload` for
      `example-org/example-repo` rows backed by a resolvable local driving
      worktree. It reuses the host's existing Codespaces + ADO auth lanes:
      probe the CodeSpace's current `remote.origin.url` over
      `gh codespace ssh`, parse the ADO repo coordinates, query active PRs
      for the current branch via an ADO REST bearer minted from the same
      injected-token / host-az sources `auth_preflight` already uses, then
      journal the PR onto the worktree through a new
      `coordination.journal_claim("pr", ref, owner_ref)` thin wrapper over
      the existing `claims add` verb. No new claim storage exists here, and
      `claims add`'s own de-dup keeps the probe idempotent.
- [x] Confirm the auto-claimed PR shows up in the claims-list with no
      manual step, and that it is visually indistinguishable from a
      manually-claimed one (same ledger, same rendering). **Done in unit
      coverage:** `picker_payload` now runs the auto-claim probe before it
      resolves `claims_summary`, and the fixed-fixture test mutates a fake
      ledger through the probe path to prove the rendered claims list is the
      same `PR #2481` string a pre-existing/manual claim would render.

### Phase 5 — New-venue → embody design handoff (design only)
- [x] Record the finalized create→embody flow design (target-info prompt,
      provisioning call, hand-off into a fresh Copilot session) as a design
      note in this effort, explicitly scoped as **input to** the parallel
      drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH effort rather than an implementation
      obligation of this effort. **Done (2026-09-22):** recorded in
      [`phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md`](phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md),
      grounded against the already-landed venue `copilot` verbs and
      `agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`' CLI-mode launch path.
- [x] Cross-link that design note from both efforts once the other effort
      exists / is identified. **Done:** the "parallel drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH"
      effort is the active
      [`agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`](../agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions/README.md)
      campaign; both effort READMEs now link the shared design note.

## Validation Plan

- [x] Before/after preview screenshots reviewed and approved by the
      operator before any implementation PR opens (Phase 0 gate).
- [x] Re-render the six approved venue-preview PNGs after the Phase 4
      row/menu changes and confirm that any byte diff is either
      pixel-identical PNG encoding drift or a deliberate design change with
      updated committed copies. **Resolved (2026-09-22):** all six
      regenerated previews were pixel-identical to the committed approved
      PNGs; only the PNG IDAT stream bytes changed, so the approved copies
      remain unchanged.
- [x] Unit tests confirming the Codespaces manifest's `subtitle` actually
      renders `pool.picker_payload`'s computed value (a regression test for
      the exact dropped-field bug this effort fixes) —
      `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py::test_real_manifest_maps_picker_payload_subtitle`
      now loads the shipped `plugins/agent-codespaces/pivots/agent-codespaces.json`,
      asserts `entry.subtitle == "subtitle"`, and proves a real
      `agent_codespaces.pool.picker_payload()` row's computed subtitle is the
      value the manifest maps; picker-side subtitle rendering remains covered
      by `worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_picker_tui.py::test_registered_pivot_account_scope_and_subtitle`.
- [x] Unit tests for the Containers pivot's new columns/group/lease-cross-
      link against `test_fleet_json.py`'s existing fixture shape —
      `plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_fleet_json.py::test_fleet_json_wires_picker_fields_from_lease`
      plus `::test_fleet_json_emits_bare_array_with_expected_fields`.
- [x] Unit tests for the Codespaces/Containers agent-bridge live-session
      joins against fixed fixtures (venue-target match, no match) —
      Codespaces:
      `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py::test_bridge_client_from_env_degrades_gracefully_without_agent_bridge`,
      `::test_sess_column_live_when_liveness_active_or_stalled`,
      `::test_sess_column_idle_when_driving_but_not_live`,
      `::test_sess_column_blank_when_nothing_driving`,
      `::test_activity_from_live_session_composes_phase_and_summary`,
      `::test_picker_payload_live_session_join_wires_sess_and_activity`;
      Containers:
      `plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_picker.py::test_live_session_for_venue_degrades_without_agent_bridge`,
      `::test_sess_column_vocabulary`,
      `::test_activity_from_live_session_composes_phase_and_summary`,
      `::test_picker_fields_shape_when_claimed`,
      `::test_picker_fields_appends_live_activity`.
- [x] Unit tests for the shared claims-pecking-order module: correct
      ordering across a mixed ledger, correct truncation to "1-2
      prominent," stable behavior with an empty ledger, and (added with the
      `.d/` registry) a plugin-contributed kind actually re-ranking and
      re-labeling a claim end-to-end — 28 tests total
      (`test_claims_rank.py` + `test_claim_kinds_registry.py`), all
      passing.
- [x] A live/manual check against a real CodeSpace and a real fleet
      container (not just fixtures) before Phase 1/2 are considered done,
      per this repo's "validate beyond unit tests" policy — partially
      completed live on 2026-09-23 and then explicitly **transferred** for the
      remaining Containers half to
      `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507`: real
      `agent-codespaces pool --picker-json` output showed a live running
      row (`friendly-eureka-x55xwv59xrwfv6qx`, `status: "RUNNING"`,
      `subtitle: "friendly-eureka-x55xwv59xrwfv6qx"`) and a real claimed row
      (`phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7`,
      `worktree: "operator-cloud1-win-20260921-180855-6e3c"`,
      `subtitle: "→ phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7"`,
      `sess: "IDLE"`). The equivalent Containers live pass could not run here
      because `agent-containers fleet --json`, `agent-containers up example-repo
      --json`, and `docker ps` all failed with the real machine-state error
      `Docker Desktop is unable to start`; see the 2026-09-23 Journal entry
      and follow-up issue `#3507`.
- [x] Confirm the Containers pivot still never surfaces a non-fleet
      container after the parity changes (no regression on the existing
      fleet-only scoping) — explicitly **transferred** to
      `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507` for execution on a
      Docker-capable host after this session proved the local daemon was
      unavailable (`Docker Desktop is unable to start`), so no honest real
      non-fleet specimen could be created or observed here.
- [x] Unit tests for the driving-worktree mark/menu-navigation actions
      (jump-to-worktree, worktree-status-card) against fixed fixtures with
      and without a driving worktree.
- [x] A live/manual check on a real example-repo CodeSpace: push a real ADO
      topic branch, open the resulting PR, and confirm it appears in the
      row's claims-list with no manual claim step (Phase 4's own
      "validate beyond unit tests" case, not just a mocked push→PR
      fixture). **Resolved (2026-09-22):** a real example-repo CodeSpace
      (`phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7`) on real branch
      `feature/operator/docs-navigation-minor-doc-fix` and real ADO PR
      `https://dev.azure.com/example-org/example-project/_git/example-repo/pullrequest/12345`
      were revalidated against the fixed local source. Before the fix, the
      installed pool row still read `claims_summary: ""` while the GitHub
      CodeSpaces metadata stayed on `branch: "main"`. After probing the live
      workspace branch + ADO remote through the fixed helper path and
      journaling the result onto the driving worktree ledger, the worktree's
      ranked claims summary became
      `PR https://dev.azure.com/example-org/example-project/_git/example-repo/pullrequest/12345 · codespace weekly-update-page-tools-6697r9j7qgp3wxp`
      and `agent-worktrees claims ... --json` showed the new active `pr`
      claim entry. See the latest Journal entry for the exact commands and
      caveats.

## Journal

### 2026-09-26 — Archived
Every Plan and Validation Plan item is resolved. Moved to the dated archive
path as part of a batch archive sweep of completed efforts.

- **2026-09-23 (latest+16)** — Performed the final checklist-reconciliation
  pass that this effort's umbrella closure had skipped. First, I closed the
  one genuinely missing coverage gap: added
  `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py::test_real_manifest_maps_picker_payload_subtitle`,
  which loads the shipped
  `plugins/agent-codespaces/pivots/agent-codespaces.json`, asserts its real
  `entry.subtitle` mapping is still present, and proves a real
  `agent_codespaces.pool.picker_payload()` row's computed subtitle is the
  exact value the manifest maps. Together with the pre-existing picker-side
  renderer coverage in
  `worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_picker_tui.py::test_registered_pivot_account_scope_and_subtitle`,
  that guards the exact regression class this effort fixed: a computed
  payload field silently dropped by the manifest layer rather than broken
  Python computation.

  Second, I revalidated the two "already done but never ticked" test buckets
  before citing them into the Validation Plan instead of adding redundant new
  tests. Containers' columns/group/lease-cross-link coverage is already in
  `plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_fleet_json.py::test_fleet_json_wires_picker_fields_from_lease`
  (plus the exact-field-shape guard
  `::test_fleet_json_emits_bare_array_with_expected_fields`). The
  Codespaces/Containers live-session join coverage is likewise already real:
  Codespaces' `_live_session_for_venue` / `_sess_column` /
  `_activity_from_live_session` / picker integration tests live in
  `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py`, and the Containers-side
  equivalents live in `plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_picker.py`.
  I also reconciled the stale Phase 0 "confirm the exact agent-bridge
  fields" checkbox: the grounding already existed above (`LiveSessionInfo
  .latest_progress`, shape `{"phase", "summary"}`) and the 2026-09-21
  Phase 1 journal already recorded that exact shape being used in the
  implementation.

  Third, I ran the real live/manual venue checks this machine could honestly
  perform. `agent-codespaces pool --picker-json` returned current live data,
  including a running real CodeSpace row
  `friendly-eureka-x55xwv59xrwfv6qx` (`status: "RUNNING"`, `health:
  "running"`, `subtitle: "friendly-eureka-x55xwv59xrwfv6qx"`) and a real
  claimed row `phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7` with the
  Phase 4 fields present (`worktree:
  "operator-cloud1-win-20260921-180855-6e3c"`, `worktree_id` same,
  `has_driving_worktree: "true"`, `subtitle:
  "→ phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7"`, `sess: "IDLE"`).
  That is real non-fixture evidence that the shipped Codespaces pivot shape is
  rendering actual live venue state. The Containers side was blocked by real
  host state, not guesswork: `agent-containers fleet --json`,
  `agent-containers up example-repo --json`, and `docker ps` each failed with
  `ERROR: Docker daemon not reachable. Is Docker Desktop running? (Error
  response from daemon: Docker Desktop is unable to start)`, `com.docker.service`
  remained `Stopped`, and unattended startup from this session did not
  converge it. Rather than fabricate a positive result, I transferred the
  remaining Docker-capable-host live validation into new follow-up issue
  `ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3507`, then marked this effort's own
  checklist explicitly reconciled through that named transfer. The effort is
  now **Done; pending archive**: every Plan/Validation Plan item is either
  completed with evidence or explicitly transferred to a tracked objective.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+15)** — Fixed the real live-validation-discovered bug
  in Phase 4's example-repo PR auto-claim path in fresh worktree
  `operator-cloud1-win-20260922-154146-755b`. The live validation against real
  CodeSpace `phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7` proved the
  shipped Phase 4 mechanism was effectively non-functional for real
  example-repo venues: the GitHub CodeSpaces row always reports repository
  `example-org/example-repo-codespaces` and keeps its `branch` metadata at the
  creation-time branch (`main` here), so the old `_auto_claim_example_repo_pr`
  short-circuited before it ever looked at the real `/workspaces/example-repo`
  checkout. I removed that wrong GH-repo pre-gate, switched detection to a
  single live git probe that resolves the real workspace folder and reads both
  `remote.origin.url` and the actually checked-out branch in one remote round
  trip, taught `_ado_remote_ref` to understand the real
  `/_git/_optimized/<repo>` URL shape returned by this venue, and made the
  auto-claim owner resolution tolerate the installed `agent-worktrees`
  record's `worktree_path`-only shape instead of assuming a local-source-only
  `path` attribute. The result is that the producer now keys off the real ADO
  checkout state instead of stale GitHub Codespaces metadata.

  Added regression coverage in `plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py`
  for all of the above: the GH-hosted CodeSpace repo no longer blocks a real
  example-repo workspace remote, the live checked-out branch wins when it differs
  from the GH API `branch` field, the optimized ADO remote form still parses to
  `example-repo`, and the existing claim-journaling path stays intact. Targeted
  pool coverage (`uv run pytest tests/test_pool.py -k "codespace_git_probe or
  auto_claim_example_repo_pr or picker_payload_auto_claimed_pr_reads_like_existing_claim
  or ado_remote_ref"`) passed cleanly. The full `agent-codespaces` suite also
  ran after `uv sync --extra dev`; it finished with **1150 passed / 28 skipped /
  4 failed**, all four in pre-existing unrelated tests
  (`test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in` x2 Windows bash-path assertions,
  `test_install_ps1_recovery` staged-uninstall timeout, and
  `test_venue_check_cli` surfacing the host's stale `config.d` findings).

  Closed the loop with real live revalidation instead of stopping at fixtures.
  The pre-fix installed binstub's pool row for
  `phase4-pr-autoclaim-validation-j6jw4jxww5v2qrj7` still showed
  `repository: "example-org/example-repo-codespaces"`, `branch: "main"`, and
  `claims_summary: ""` even though an SSH check of `/workspaces/example-repo`
  confirmed the real branch was
  `feature/operator/docs-navigation-minor-doc-fix`. I then made one more tiny
  doc-only commit on that real branch from the live CodeSpace so the still-open
  real ADO PR stayed current (`pullRequestId: 2398823`, status `active`,
  `lastMergeSourceCommit: 569a04e7a108e14e321bf5d20cb79d94bcfe3ecf`). Because a
  not-yet-installed local plugin copy cannot simply replace the ambient
  installed binstub, I exercised the fixed local source directly from this
  worktree: `uv run python` imported the edited helper code, ran the real
  remote git probe against the live CodeSpace, resolved
  `https://dev.azure.com/example-org/example-project/_git/example-repo/pullrequest/12345`,
  and journaled it onto the driving worktree ledger. Concrete after-evidence:
  `agent-worktrees claims operator-cloud1-win-20260921-180855-6e3c --json`
  gained a new active `{"kind":"pr","ref":"https://dev.azure.com/example-org/example-project/_git/example-repo/pullrequest/12345",...}`
  entry, and the fixed `claims_summary` resolver for that driving worktree now
  reads
  `PR https://dev.azure.com/example-org/example-project/_git/example-repo/pullrequest/12345 · codespace weekly-update-page-tools-6697r9j7qgp3wxp`.
  That closes the final explicit validation item for this effort.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+14)** — Completed Phase 5's design-only closeout in
  fresh worktree `operator-cloud1-win-20260922-123333-e9c8`. Searched the
  active effort tree for the parallel "drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH" work and
  identified [`agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions`](../agent-bridge-cli-mode-sessions/README.md)
  as the real counterpart: it already owns the provider-agnostic
  venue-`copilot` reserve/connect/release path and the underlying
  CLI-mode Session Host launch contract (`agent-bridge live-sessions
  cli-mode launch` -> `agent-worktrees embody`). Recorded the finalized
  New-venue design note as
  [`phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md`](phase5-new-venue-embody-design.md):
  picker-side **target-info prompt → provider-specific provision call
  (`agent-codespaces create ...` / `agent-containers up ...`) → hand off to
  the same provider `copilot <name>` path Phase 3 already uses for Open**,
  with the still-open pivot-registry gap called out explicitly (a true
  row-independent/pivot-level action slot is still needed to surface "New
  codespace"/"New container" declaratively). Cross-linked the note from both
  efforts and checked off Phase 5's remaining Plan items. The effort is now
  phase-complete; only validation remains open.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+13)** — Resolved the deferred Phase 4 preview-diff
  question conclusively in the Phase 5 worktree. Built the fresh
  `worktree-manager` preview environment here (`uv sync --extra dev` plus
  `npm install` under `worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/`), reran
  `render_venue_preview.py`, and compared each regenerated PNG against the
  committed approved copy with a real pixel diff (Pillow `ImageChops
  .difference`, not just hashes). Result: **all six pairs are RGBA-identical**
  (`bbox=None` for every comparison) and still match in dimensions; the only
  difference is byte-level drift inside the PNG `IDAT` stream
  (same `IHDR`/`IEND`, no metadata chunks). So the Phase 4 row/menu work did
  **not** silently change the approved visuals in this worktree, and the
  committed `design-previews/*.png` stay untouched to avoid meaningless diff
  noise. Added the Validation Plan check above so future sessions can close
  the same question explicitly rather than rediscovering it from the Journal.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+12)** — Investigated the remaining live/manual
  example-repo validation honestly instead of hand-waving it. Using the exact
  session-catalog `agent-worktrees` / `agent-codespaces` binstubs,
  `agent-worktrees related resolve example-repo` confirmed the preferred locus
  is a CodeSpace with checkout `/workspaces/example-repo`; `gh codespace list`
  showed existing example-repo CodeSpaces; `agent-codespaces check
  friendly-eureka-x55xwv59xrwfv6qx --json` proved at least one venue is
  fully CLI-mode ready; and `agent-codespaces ssh` against the available
  venues showed two separate blockers to *this* session doing the full
  push→real-PR validation itself:
  (1) the two already-available CodeSpaces were both under other live
  worktrees' exclusive claims, so using them would require an explicit
  `--force-claim` takeover of someone else's active venue; and
  (2) a separate shutdown CodeSpace
  (`weekly-update-page-tools-6697r9j7qgp3wxp`) could be started and
  inspected safely enough to confirm the real example-repo checkout and push
  remote (`/workspaces/example-repo`, ADO push URL present, host-side ADO bearer
  minting available), but completing the actual Validation Plan item from
  here would still mean mutating a real example-repo topic branch and opening a
  real ADO PR from an unattended copilot-extensions session with no
  sanctioned cleanup/ownership context. I therefore left the checkbox
  unchecked and recorded the exact commands + facts here so a dedicated
  example-repo session (or the operator directly) can run the real branch/PR
  drill before closing the umbrella.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+11)** — Completed Phase 4 in fresh worktree
  `operator-cloud1-win-20260922-113718-4a4e`. Grounded the
  driving-worktree drill-in against the already-landed Tasks-pane
  precedent in three places: the picker's generic internal navigation
  surface (`engine_worktree_actions._internal_pivot_action` /
  `_jump_to_worktree`), the generic read-only card surface
  (`kind:"card"` -> `PivotCardScreen`), and the Worktrees-pane exact-id
  requirement from the Tasks-pane reverse-cross-link tests (`jump-host`
  resolves by stable full worktree id, not a 4-char display token). That
  exact-id requirement is the key Phase 4 grounding decision: the
  Codespaces/Containers rows keep their existing display-side
  `worktree`/`lease` tokens for title + claims correlation, but now also
  carry a separate `worktree_id` drill-in field plus an explicit
  `has_driving_worktree` gate. Both real pivot manifests add two new
  per-entry actions gated on that flag: **View driving worktree** (reuses
  the existing `jump-host` internal action; the picker now falls back to
  `ctx["worktree_id"]` before the display token) and **Worktree status**
  (a real `kind:"card"` action sourcing a new row-supplied
  `worktree_status` payload). The claims-list column needed **no new
  storage**: it still reads the same worktree claim ledger through the
  existing Phase 1/2 cross-link; Phase 4 only adds a producer.

  The reserved line-two driving-worktree mark landed as the Phase 0
  `[mark]` slot, not a new stat column: Codespaces prefixes the composed
  subtitle with `→` when a row is backed by a resolvable local driving
  worktree (and retains `⚠` for the orphaned-lock case); Containers uses
  the same mark contract through `picker_fields`. The Worktree Status card
  payloads are provider-computed row data, mirroring agent-dispatch's own
  Tasks-pane shape rather than inventing a new picker engine. Each card is
  built from the existing agent-worktrees state already available to the
  host: the tracked worktree record plus the existing
  `status-segment --json` facts (`status_bar_cli._status_segment_json`),
  summarized into repo/worktree/branch/turn/live/git/closure/claims.

  Implemented the example-repo PR auto-claim as a **read-triggered, idempotent
  producer** in `agent_codespaces.pool` (the one new mechanism Phase 4
  actually needed). There was still no pre-existing hook for "branch push
  became PR", so the minimal consistent detection point is the codespace row
  materialization itself: for a `example-org/example-repo` row backed by a
  resolvable local driving worktree, `picker_payload` now probes the
  CodeSpace's current `remote.origin.url` over `gh codespace ssh`, parses
  ADO repo coordinates (`ssh.dev.azure.com`, `dev.azure.com`, and
  `*.visualstudio.com` forms), queries active PRs for the current branch
  via an ADO REST bearer minted from the same injected-token / host-az
  sources `auth_preflight` already uses, then journals the result through
  a new `coordination.journal_claim(kind, ref, owner_ref)` wrapper over the
  existing `agent-worktrees claims add <kind> <ref>` verb. Because the
  producer runs before `claims_summary` is resolved, the row's claims list
  reads an auto-claimed PR **exactly** the same way as a manual claim
  (same ledger, same `claims_rank` rendering) -- proved by fixed-fixture
  unit coverage.

  Validation: new unit coverage in all three affected suites --
  `agent-codespaces` (10 new tests around the reserved mark, worktree
  status card payload, ADO remote parsing, auto-claim journaling, and the
  "auto-claimed looks manual" ledger/render contract),
  `agent-containers` (6 new tests around the mark/drill-in fields and
  unavailable-vs-resolved Worktree Status payload), and worktree-manager
  (an internal-action fallback test plus a generic manifest gate test for
  `has_driving_worktree`). Ran:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest plugins/agent-codespaces/tests/test_pool.py`
  (74 passed),
  `uv run --extra dev pytest plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_picker.py plugins/agent-containers/tests/test_fleet_json.py`
  (20 passed),
  `uv run --extra dev pytest plugins/agent-worktrees/tests/test_claims_cmd.py plugins/agent-worktrees/tests/test_claims_rank.py`
  (63 passed),
  `uv run --extra dev pytest worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_pivots.py worktree-manager/tests/production_picker/test_picker_tui.py worktree-manager/tests/test_plugin_contracts.py worktree-manager/tests/test_production_picker_transplant.py`
  (394 passed),
  then the full `worktree-manager` suite
  (1099 passed, 1 skipped). Also reran the venue-preview renderer after the
  row/menu changes; all six outputs regenerated successfully and preserved
  the committed dimensions, but byte-differed from the approved
  `design-previews/*.png` (small renderer drift across all six, with the
  Phase-4 menu lane naturally differing most). The north-star design itself
  was not intentionally revised in this phase, so I recorded the
  comparison here rather than replacing the committed approved previews.
  **Still outstanding:** the Validation Plan's real example-repo live/manual
  push→PR check remains unchecked; I confirmed example-repo CodeSpaces are
  accessible from this machine, but did not mutate a real branch/PR from a
  live venue inside this phase worktree.

- **2026-09-22 (latest+10)** — Merged PR #3268 (Phase 2), closed `#3255`,
  and started Phase 3 in a fresh worktree after the operator reported
  `agent-codespaces copilot`/`agent-containers copilot` were now built.
  Grounded them against `copilot_venue.py` + the vendored `venue_copilot`
  lib: both already implement reserve/ensure-mux/attach-or-embody
  uniformly for a live *or* dormant venue -- confirming the vision's
  "behavior parity with a dormant venue" requirement structurally, not
  just by testing. The real gap for Phase 3 turned out to be
  **picker-engine-side**, not remote-side: a plain manifest `run` action
  executes in a background thread with captured output (no real TTY), and
  the existing `open-cli` internal action explicitly rejects any row whose
  `source_kind` isn't `"machine-ssh"` -- neither mechanism could hand off
  an interactive remote Copilot session. Added a new internal action,
  `open-venue`, to **worktree-manager** (not agent-codespaces/
  agent-containers): `_task_action_ctx` derives `ctx["provider"]` from the
  registered pivot's own `list` argv[0] (no hardcoded provider list);
  `_open_venue` builds an `{"action": "open-venue", "provider", "venue"}`
  decision and exits the picker (`open-cli`'s own exit-and-launch
  plumbing); `worktree_manager/__main__.py` maps it onto a new
  `launcher.open_venue(provider, venue)` (resolve the binstub via `PATH`,
  `subprocess.run([binstub, "copilot", venue])` with inherited stdio for
  the real-TTY handoff). Wired `{"kind": "internal", "verb": "open-venue"}`
  as an **ungated** "Open" action into both real pivot manifests (no
  `when` clause needed -- the venue command already handles live-or-dormant
  uniformly). Hit the same module-size-baseline-at-zero-headroom wall
  Phase 2 hit, this time in `worktree_manager/__main__.py`: extracted a
  genuinely duplicated `machine`/`environment`-resolution block (identical
  inline in both the "resume" and "new" decision branches) into a new
  `_remote_machine_env` helper, made real room instead of widening the
  baseline. 12 new tests (`test_picker_tui.py`/
  `test_production_picker_transplant.py`/`test_launcher.py`); full
  worktree-manager suite green (1093 tests, 1 pre-existing unrelated flake
  confirmed passing in isolation) plus
  `test_plugin_contracts.py::test_real_checkout_manifests_match_contract`
  validating both edited real manifests. Not yet landed as its own PR.
- **2026-09-22 (latest+9)** — Merged PR #3219 (Phase 0 + Phase 1) after
  resolving version-field merge conflicts with `origin/main` (agent-worktrees
  had independently advanced past this branch's own Phase 0 bump; a
  coincidental identical `agent-codespaces` dev number on both sides for
  different content, disambiguated). All CI checks green
  (`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`); squash-merged via self-merge authority.
  Closed sub-issue `#3254`. Finalized that worktree and opened a fresh one
  (`operator-cloud1-win-20260922-002606-0a9a`) off the post-merge `main` for
  Phase 2, per the effort's own per-phase-worktree convention.

  Completed Phase 2 (Containers pivot) in that fresh worktree. Grounded
  against the approved `agent-containers.proposed.json` preview manifest,
  which turned out simpler than Codespaces in one respect: `entry.worktree`/
  `entry.group` map straight to the fleet JSON's already-present `lease`/
  `fleet` raw fields -- no derived-field indirection needed (unlike
  Codespaces' computed `worktree`/`group`). Added a new
  `agent_containers/picker.py` module (`subtitle_for`/
  `claims_summary_for_worktree`/`bridge_client_from_env`/
  `live_session_for_venue`/`sess_column`/`activity_from_live_session`/
  `picker_fields`) -- duplicated logic from agent-codespaces' `pool.py`
  equivalents (no shared glue module exists between the two independent
  plugins; consistent with how both already vendor their own separate
  `copilot_venue.py`/`venue-copilot` lib rather than sharing one).
  `_cmd_fleet` now merges `picker.picker_fields(name, lease)`'s 3 new fields
  onto each row -- Containers' manifest reuses the plain `fleet --json`
  shape directly (per the approved design) rather than a dedicated
  `--picker-json` command the way Codespaces has, so
  `test_fleet_json_emits_bare_array_with_expected_fields`'s exact-field-set
  assertion needed a deliberate, tracked update. Added single-container
  `stop <name>`/`remove <name>` CLI subcommands (`_cmd_stop`/`_cmd_remove`),
  wired to `lifecycle.py`'s existing `stop_container`/`remove_container`
  primitives and gated against removing a leased container -- the
  per-container analogue of `down`/`rm`'s existing whole-fleet scope, backing
  the manifest's new gated Stop/Remove actions. Updated
  `pivots/agent-containers.json` to match the approved proposed manifest
  (columns, group, worktree cross-link, subtitle, actions), dropping the
  now-redundant `badges` declaration. 12 new tests (`test_picker.py` +
  extensions to `test_fleet_json.py`/`test_cli_operations.py`); full
  agent-containers suite green apart from 7 pre-existing, unrelated
  Windows-POSIX-permission/bash failures (confirmed identical via
  `git stash`/`git stash pop`). Not yet landed as its own PR.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+8)** — Completed Phase 1. Added the agent-bridge
  live-session join to `pool.py`: `_bridge_client_from_env` (a silent,
  never-raising, never-`sys.exit`-ing hand-rolled variant of
  `BridgeClient.from_config()` -- that classmethod prints to stderr and
  exits on a missing auth token, wrong for an inline pool-listing call),
  `_live_session_for_venue` (matches `venue.kind`/`venue.target` across
  `list_live_sessions()`), `_sess_column` (`LIVE`/`IDLE`/`""` per the
  vision's exact rule), and `_activity_from_live_session` (the
  `{phase}: {summary}` transient half). Grounded `latest_progress`'s shape
  and the liveness vocabulary against `inventory_cli._live_session_summary_line`
  and `routes.live_sessions._live_liveness` -- the one open Phase 0
  grounding item, now resolved. Added the `sess` column to
  `pivots/agent-codespaces.json` matching the approved proposed manifest.
  8 new tests. Resolved the New-codespace entry point as design-only:
  grounded that the pivot-registry contract has no pivot-level (row-
  independent) action concept today, so it genuinely cannot be expressed
  as a manifest snippet -- recorded as a named schema gap for whichever
  effort implements the real create→embody flow, per this effort's own
  Guiding Intent item 7 deferral, rather than inventing a workaround here.
  78 pool tests total (16 new across the whole phase); full
  agent-codespaces suite still green apart from the same 2 pre-existing
  unrelated failures. Phase 2 (Containers) is next, in a fresh worktree per
  the effort's own per-phase-PR sequencing.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+7)** — Filed the umbrella issue
  (`ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#3253`) and one sub-issue per Plan phase
  (`#3254`-`#3258`), the last open Phase 0 housekeeping item. Started Phase
  1: wired `pool.picker_payload`'s `claims_summary` entry field to the
  shared `claims_rank` module via a new `_claims_summary_for_worktree`
  helper (looked up by the claiming worktree's short id, lazy-imported
  `agent_worktrees` the same way `config._registered_repo_paths` already
  does — agent-codespaces has no hard dependency on agent-worktrees, so
  this degrades to `""` rather than raising when it isn't installed
  alongside); wired `pivots/agent-codespaces.json`'s `entry.subtitle` (the
  durable-title half of line two) and added a `claims_summary` column
  matching the approved `agent-codespaces.proposed.json` preview manifest's
  width/priority. 3 new tests (`test_pool.py`); full agent-codespaces
  suite green (565 pass) apart from 2 pre-existing, unrelated
  `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py` failures confirmed present on
  the pre-change tree too (a Windows-bash path-translation issue, verified
  via `git stash`/`git stash pop`).
- **2026-09-21 (latest+6)** — Operator proposed a `.d/` drop-in system so
  any module/plugin can declare claim-type metadata (kind + priority),
  "so any system can offer claims and play" — mirroring the Picker's own
  pivot-contribution pattern (`pivots/<name>.json` drop-ins). Implemented
  `agent_worktrees.claim_kinds_registry`: scans every installed plugin's
  own `claim-kinds/*.json`, merges onto `claims_rank.DEFAULT_PECKING_ORDER`
  (override an existing tier or add a brand-new kind). Deliberately
  lighter-weight than the pivot registry's own contract — no identity
  verification, no legacy migration, no materialized-runtime-directory
  step — since a claim-kind declaration carries no executable command to
  spoof. `claims_rank` gained `pecking_order=`/`label_overrides=`
  parameters so it stays pure/I/O-free while consuming the merged result.
  12 new tests (28 total across both modules), including an end-to-end
  test proving a plugin-contributed kind re-ranks and re-labels a claim
  with zero `claims_rank.py` changes. Reused `dropin_registry`'s own
  `scan_directory`/`EntryDecision`/`Finding` primitives (the same shared
  library the pivot registry builds on) rather than reinventing directory
  scanning.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+5)** — Implemented the shared claims-pecking-order
  module for real (the last open Phase 0 item):
  `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/claims_rank.py`
  (`rank_claims`, `format_claim`, `summarize_claims` — pure functions,
  `ResourceClaim`-shaped input, no I/O) plus
  `tests/test_claims_rank.py` (13 tests, all passing; ran the existing
  `test_claims_cmd.py`/`test_claim_handoffs.py` suites too — 83 total, no
  regressions). Grounded the exact pecking-order-to-kind mapping against
  `claims_cli._claims_add`'s real `valid_kinds` set while building it, and
  recorded in the module's own docstring that "bug"/"issue", "effort", and
  "bridge" aren't claimable kinds yet — the ranking degrades gracefully
  (unrecognized kind sorts last) rather than assuming they exist. Phase 0
  is now fully complete; Phase 1 has not started (the module exists but
  nothing calls it from the real `pool.py` yet — that's Phase 1's first
  task).
- **2026-09-21 (latest+4)** — Operator approved the Phase 0 screenshots and
  asked that they be **committed to the repo**, not left OneDrive-only —
  noting the Tasks-pane-ux effort's own previews never got this treatment
  (they still live only at `OneDrive/2026/09.17 agent-dispatch Tasks Pane
  UX Overhaul Previews`) and that a durable, version-controlled copy lets a
  later session diff a re-render against the *actually-approved* design
  rather than trusting memory or a local-only OneDrive folder. Copied the
  six approved PNGs into `design-previews/` (committed alongside this
  README, embedded/linked from the new "Design Previews" section) and
  marked Phase 0's operator-review item done. Phase 0 is now fully
  complete except the still-open claims-pecking-order module design.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+3)** — Operator reviewed the rendered screenshots and
  flagged the `driven` column: too much width for a boolean, and pointed at
  the Worktrees pane's own compact `sess`/`live` column (key `sess`, header
  "live", 4 chars, multi-valued: pulsing "●"/`PROC`/`LOCK`) as the right
  model. Dropped `driven` entirely — it duplicated what the already-present
  `worktree` cross-link column signals (non-blank = driven) — and adopted
  that same column verbatim (same key/header/width) for the one genuinely
  new signal, session liveness: `LIVE`/`IDLE` (`IDLE` already exists in the
  picker's own `state` palette)/blank. Updated `fake_pool.py`/
  `fake_fleet.py` (removed `driven`+`live` fields, added one `sess` field)
  and both proposed manifests (column + all three `when` gates), re-ran the
  render script — all six screenshots regenerated successfully — and
  re-synced the updated PNGs to the same dated OneDrive folder.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+2)** — Built and ran the Phase 0 preview tooling
  (`worktree-manager/scripts/picker-snapshot/venue-preview/`): hermetic
  demo Worktrees source, `fake_pool.py`/`fake_fleet.py` fixtures (4/3 rows
  each covering driven+live, driven+idle, undriven, and orphaned-lock
  scenarios), byte-copies of both real current manifests, and two proposed
  manifests. Built the `agent-worktrees` and `worktree-manager` `.venv`s in
  this worktree and rendered all six screenshots against the real Textual
  engine on the **first attempt** — no engine.py changes needed (confirmed
  the row grammar, driven column, and claims column are all achievable as
  pure manifest + backend-command work, using the exact same
  `subtitle_field`/`Column`/`worktree_field` mechanisms `worktree_title`
  auto-injection already proved out). Decided the driving-worktree
  indicator lives in a dedicated `driven` column (not the `[mark]` glyph),
  freeing `[mark]` for line two's own relation semantics — **later
  superseded by the entry above.** The shared claims-pecking-order module
  remains undesigned; the preview's `claims_summary` values are explicit
  placeholders. Next: operator review of the screenshots.
- **2026-09-21 (latest+1)** — Operator supplied a shared claims prominence
  ranking (PR > bug > effort > bridge > CodeSpace/container > child
  worktree > machine SSH > dispatch task, tunable; human-mappable/
  quick-find first, dispatch tasks penalized for lacking an externally
  referenceable id) meant to apply across every pivot's claims-list, not
  just this effort's two. Grounded: confirmed no prominent-claims-selection
  code exists anywhere yet (`engine.py`/`pivot_manifest.py` grep) — this is
  genuinely new shared infrastructure, proposed to live in `agent-worktrees`
  since it already owns the ledger being ranked. Added Phase 0 design task,
  Phase 1 build-it task, Phase 2 reuse-it task, and flagged in the vision's
  Non-Goals that aligning the Worktrees/Tasks panes' own prominent-artifact
  selection onto this ranking is a cross-vision coordination item, not
  something owned outright here.
- **2026-09-21 (latest)** — Operator refined the title/activity model and
  added new scope: `<title>` is a declared checkout intent (distinct from
  the venue's repo/spec identity, which stays a line-one fact); `<activity>`
  is an accumulating snagged-signal stream, not limited to agent-bridge.
  Added a new Phase 4: a reserved driving-worktree mark/navigation (view
  driving worktree, or its Worktree Status card — mirroring
  agent-dispatch's own direction) and an example-repo-scoped PR auto-claim
  (a CodeSpace's pushed ADO branch auto-journals its resulting PR onto the
  driving worktree via the *existing* `agent-worktrees claims add pr <ref>`
  ledger — clarified in grounding that claims are that existing ledger, not
  a new store this effort invents; the only new piece is the push→PR
  detection point, which has no existing hook today).
- **2026-09-21 (later)** — Operator specified a precise row grammar: line
  one stays columnar (`[ ] <id> STATUS <stats> <claims>`); line two is
  free-form and must read as `"[mark] <durable title> - <transient
  activity>"`, with the transient activity (not the title) truncated first
  when space is short. Recorded as the vision's new "Row grammar" concept
  and threaded through the Codespaces subtitle-wiring and Containers
  parity plan items above — both were previously described only as
  "restore/add a subtitle," now pinned to this exact two-part content
  contract.
- **2026-09-21** — Effort opened from an operator request to overhaul the
  Codespaces/Containers pivots. Initially drafted the vision/effort as if
  neither pivot existed ("no registered pivot surfaces a CodeSpace or an
  agent-shaped container as a first-class row at all") — **this was
  wrong**. The operator corrected: both `agent-codespaces` and
  `agent-containers` already contribute pivots
  (`pivots/agent-codespaces.json`, `pivots/agent-containers.json`); the ask
  is to overhaul those existing contributions for presentation consistency
  and information fidelity, not build new ones. Re-grounded against
  `pool.py`'s `picker_payload` (rich, columnar, but with a dropped
  `subtitle` field) and `_cmd_fleet`'s real JSON shape (only 4 of ~16
  fields currently mapped, no columns/group/cross-link/actions at all) and
  rewrote both documents accordingly. Operator decisions still in force:
  both pivots in one effort; New-venue→embody is design-only here
  (implementation deferred to the parallel drive-CLI-agents-over-SSH
  effort); effort/vision land in copilot-extensions (where
  `worktree-manager` and the venue-provider plugins already live).
