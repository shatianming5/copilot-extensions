## Guiding Intent

The runtime plugin suite is now routinely operated at a point it was not
originally tuned for: **many concurrent worktree sessions on one host** (order of
5–10), with **frequent mid-flight plugin updates** — every new session launch may
re-run a service's `start` and trigger a reinstall while other sessions are live.
The architecture already handles this *by design* (immutable versioned slots, a
tested zero-downtime cutover, cheap session hooks, liveness-reconciled routing).
The remaining gaps are **hygiene**: a few places where processes are spawned but
not fully reaped, where a cutover leaks its predecessor, or where the launch path
blocks on an update. This effort closes them — and gives the suite the two
missing intent-level primitives (a single-instance lease and an optional
work-coalescing tier) that make the fixes principled rather than ad hoc.

The through-line: **consolidate the warm runtime, complete the reaping, and never
block a launch on an update** — while keeping every consolidation strictly
optional with an always-correct inline fallback (à-la-carte independence is
non-negotiable).

## Context

A process-management audit (framework libs + each plugin's install/lifecycle,
cross-checked against a live host running ~7 concurrent sessions) found:

- **Sound and working:** the coordinator plugin's post-cutover reap (a replaced
  predecessor is retired cleanly); immutable versioned slots; the `zdd` cutover
  library and its tests; the rendezvous/routing libs; cheap session-start hooks
  across all plugins except the worktrees launcher.
- **Leaks under concurrency + churn:**
  - The bridge cutover retires only its **direct** predecessor, so repeated
    same-version cutovers (one per session launch) **strand live passives**
    holding a port + memory (#738).
  - The worktrees **per-session status-updater** is a detached durable runner
    that is not re-asserted on update and not reaped on session end, and it
    **pins old version slots alive** (blocking GC) (#739).
  - The launcher **joins/applies a plugin update in the launch path**, so bursts
    of session launches serialize on the install lock (#740).
  - agent-mcp never **GCs stale versioned installs** (#741), and runs **one heavy
    stdio bridge per session per server** — the dominant process-count/memory
    multiplier (#744).
  - No shared **single-instance lease**; overlap prevention is heuristic (#737).
  - Binstub **newest-slot fallback** can bind the wrong version during a
    marker-absent window mid-swap (#742).
  - agent-vault restarts (not drains) on update, forcing a **re-unlock** (#743).

## Request

Implement the tracked hygiene fixes and supporting primitives needed to keep the
runtime plugin suite concurrency-safe, update-safe, and launch-safe under
routine multi-session use.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Intent (vision + this effort) — *this PR*

- Extend `visions/plugin-services` with **`single-instance-lease`** and
  **`work-coalescing-singleton`** behaviors + Concepts entries + provenance.
- Author this effort; file the umbrella (#736) and sub-issues (#737–#744).
- No implementation; the reviewed intent lands before any code. Reconciled:
  vision-extending (lease + coalescing tier), vision-closing (worktrees resident
  tracker), the rest below-altitude conformance.

### Phase 1c — Lifecycle supervision policy and conformance audit (#625)

- Extend `visions/plugin-services` with the least-privilege lifecycle pecking
  order, stable register-once launcher, cutover-on-update, and disposable
  payload guarantees.
- Extend `service-lifecycle-supervision` with the four-tier decision rule, the
  stable-launcher update path, and the Windows process-current-directory trap.
- Audit agent-dispatch, agent-bridge, and agent-vault against those guarantees.
  Record conforming evidence, absorb gaps into an existing tracker where one
  exists, and file a focused follow-up only for an untracked gap before closing
  #625. Treat agent-worktrees #1550 as the already-closed hook-launch precedent
  for the payload-working-directory rule. Track the pattern's newly required
  per-plugin tier declarations and user-mode-ensure adoption in #1841.
- Keep this slice intent/documentation-only until its reviewed PR lands; any
  conformance implementation follows in later PRs under the tracked gaps.

### Phase 2 — Shared single-instance lease + reaper primitive (#737)

- New stdlib library beside `zdd`/rendezvous: a host-local, liveness-reconciled
  lease ("one active per service per host") + a reconcile-set reaper (retire every
  own-process not `active`/self, anchored on the promoted port; fail-soft).
- Vendored into consumers the way `zdd` is. Unit tests for acquire/stand-down,
  dead-owner reclaim, and reap-the-strays.
- Coordinates with the in-flight upstream process-spawn-guard work so the guard
  lands **here** (shared) rather than per-plugin.

### Phase 3 — agent-bridge: idempotent start + complete reap (#738)

- Same-version `start` against a healthy active daemon becomes a **no-op** (kill
  the generation churn at the source).
- Post-cutover, invoke the shared reconcile-set reaper (Phase 2) so no
  drained-but-live passive lingers. Fold into the update/restart path per #438.

### Phase 4 — agent-worktrees: no-block launch + resident tracker (#740, #739)

- Launch on the **currently-active** slot immediately; apply any staged update on
  the **next** launch (or hand to the durable service); apply is async +
  lock-guarded (#740).
- Build the **refcounted resident tracker** (closes the agent-worktrees vision
  accelerator): one warm, idle-exiting monitor that coalesces status sweeps for
  all sessions, refcounted per session, reaped on last-consumer exit, with an
  inline poll fallback — retiring the per-session updater fan-out (#739).

### Phase 4b — agent-worktrees: coalesced session lifecycle hooks (#1788)

- Replace the nine independent `sessionStart` command trees with one bounded
  lifecycle client path for behavior that can safely reuse the resident
  monitor's warm project, repository, and session state.
- Preserve project-owned session-start hooks, provisioning, registration,
  anchor hygiene, and marketplace reconciliation semantics without repeatedly
  importing the full CLI or performing nested repository discovery.
- Keep a bounded monitor-down fallback that preserves required registration and
  safety behavior, and retain cross-platform parity for hook ordering and
  side-effect-only context production.
- Measure the remaining extension-host and lifecycle-event surface after
  deployment; route any separate hot path to its own issue rather than widening
  the combined client into an unbounded startup coordinator.

### Phase 4b(ii) — Convergence design + adversarial mock (#2300, #2301)

- Generalize agent-worktrees' own bounded-client shape (Phase 4b, above) into
  a suite-wide **transient hook client contract** every plugin's hooks and
  extension callbacks can follow, realizing the two Behaviors PR #2300 added
  to `visions/plugin-services`.
- Design + the adversarial mock harness that validates the contract in the
  abstract (concurrent-flood, absent-daemon, mid-flight-appearance,
  daemon-death, and daemon-election scenarios) **before** any per-plugin code
  change — full design in
  [`adversarial-convergence-mock.md`](adversarial-convergence-mock.md).
  **Landed**: `tools/clean-room/scenarios/plugin-process-hygiene-convergence/`
  (6/6 scenarios PASS locally).
- Feed the mock's evidence, plus #2301's per-plugin audit citations, into a
  scoped decision on which plugin (if any) needs an actual code change versus
  already conforming (agent-worktrees post-#918/#1788 is the reference
  implementation).
- No plugin code changes in this sub-phase; the design doc + mock harness are
  the deliverables, each cleared through the review gate before the next
  lands.

### Phase 4c — agent-worktrees: single-instance lease over the classify pass

- **Problem, evidence-grounded.** `_classify_records` (the ~5-git-calls-per-
  worktree batch classification) is the shared entry point behind BOTH the
  Picker's in-process `data_local.load(classify=True)` Phase 2 AND a standalone
  `list --json --classify` CLI invocation. Nothing today keeps two callers from
  running it **concurrently for the same project** — e.g. an open Worktree
  Manager's own populate racing an independently launched `resolve`/`list
  --classify` (observed live: two distinct process trees, different parent
  PIDs, touching the same tracking directory at once). `_RecordLock` prevents
  torn writes, but not duplicated work, and a caller that arrives mid-pass has
  nothing to wait on today.
- **Symptom this produces.** While a project's `state` is transiently
  unavailable to a reader (mid-race, or any other cause), `derive._state()`'s
  fallback (`status == "active" -> WIP if turn_count > 0`) renders a **freshly
  invented, potentially wrong** interim label instead of the row's last-known
  correct value — the "cache renders, then jumps to something completely
  different" flicker an operator can observe in the Picker.
- **Fix, placement decided.** Wrap the batch classify pass — at
  `_classify_records`, the lower/shared entry point, so both the Picker and any
  standalone CLI classify call inherit it automatically — with a **per-project**
  `single_instance_lease.SingleInstance` (Phase 2's primitive; a short-lived
  critical-section use, not a persistent daemon lease). Keyed on the project's
  tracking dir, mirroring the existing lease's `port`-keying idiom for "two
  processes, same identity, must not run set at once."
- **Contention policy, chosen deliberately (do not default to skip).** A caller
  that loses the race must **wait (bounded, on the order of a typical classify
  pass) for the winner to finish, then re-read the now-repaired session-render
  cache** — never fall back to computing its own competing/incomplete answer,
  and never simply skip-and-render-stale (that reproduces the exact reported
  symptom: the loser renders a worse answer and never gets the winner's
  repair). This realizes the operator's framing directly: one process does the
  (more expensive, authoritative) recompute; every other caller's job is to
  read the result it produces, not race it.
- **Scope discipline.** This is a narrow, single-consumer application of the
  Phase 2 primitive to a real, evidence-grounded race in agent-worktrees's own
  classify path — not a new cross-cutting cache layer, and not the same
  problem Phase 4b(ii) governs (that phase is about hook/callback transience;
  this is about two independent *batch classification* callers).
- **Landed:** design (#2315) then implementation (#2322) — both merged.
  ``_classify_records`` acquires the per-project lease; a losing caller waits
  (bounded, default 15s) then answers from `_classify_from_cache` (a fresh
  disk re-read, never a guessed state); the lease is advisory-only (any
  lease-layer failure degrades to classifying live, unchanged from before this
  phase). See Phase 4d below for the larger direction this narrow fix is a
  down payment on.

### Phase 4d — agent-worktrees: resident accelerator daemon for classify/list (#2323)

- **Relationship to Phase 4c.** Phase 4c's lease serializes two racing
  classify callers but does not eliminate the second caller's cost — the
  winner still pays the full live classification, and every caller still
  boots its own process, resolves its own config, and reasons about its own
  cache. This phase builds the steady-state target PR #2319's vision revision
  now states explicitly: a reachable resident accelerator that **owns** the
  computation, with ordinary readers (not only session-lifecycle hooks)
  reaching it as thin, ref-counted subscribers. Phase 4c's lease is **not
  superseded** — it remains the correct fallback/degraded path for exactly
  the case this phase's daemon is unreachable or absent.
- **Placement.** Extend `hook_ipc.py`'s existing token-authed TCP surface
  (currently scoped to `session-lifecycle-v1` hook decisions only) with a new
  request kind for list/classify data. The resident status-monitor
  (`cmd_status_monitor` — already single-active via a liveness lock, already
  idle-exits on no demand, already self-retires on supersession) becomes the
  daemon that answers it, rather than a second, purpose-built process.
- **Client shape.** An ordinary caller (CLI `list`/`get`, the Picker) becomes
  a thin client: resolve identity, boot the monitor on demand if none is
  reachable (waiting for it to publish its address), request, read, exit. The
  daemon's own lifetime is governed by **explicit subscriber ref-counting**
  plus a bounded linger — not the TTL/demand-registration heuristic
  `list_cache.py` uses today, which infers demand rather than counting live
  subscribers.
- **The cold-start budget constraint (flagged during design, must not be
  dropped in implementation).** `hook_ipc`'s existing request read timeout is
  1 second — correct for a hook decision, far too short for a cold
  classification pass (which can take seconds for a worktree-heavy project).
  The client's boot-wait-request sequence needs its own, much larger timeout
  budget, with an explicit fallback to today's direct path (Phase 4c's lease,
  or plain live classification when the lease is also unavailable) when no
  daemon becomes reachable in time. A first caller after an idle-exit must
  never be worse off than before this phase existed.
- **Validation.** Extend the adversarial mock harness (Phase 4b(ii),
  `tools/clean-room/scenarios/plugin-process-hygiene-convergence/`) with new
  scenarios: cold-boot-and-wait-for-port, concurrent-callers-during-cold-boot
  (exactly one boots, the rest wait, all receive the correct answer),
  ref-counted-exit (the daemon lingers until the last subscriber's grace
  period elapses, then exits), and the fallback-to-direct-computation path
  firing correctly when the boot-wait times out.
- **Sequencing.** Design-first per this effort's standing convention: a
  reviewed design PR (naming the exact request/response wire shape, the
  ref-count/linger algorithm, and the timeout budgets) lands before any
  plugin code change.

### Phase 5 — agent-mcp: version GC + optional multiplexer (#741, #744)

- Call `versioned_runtime.gc()` on successful activation (prune non-current,
  non-live slots) — apply the same convention suite-wide (#741).
- Promote the optional serve tier into a per-`(host, server)` **multiplexer**
  (one warm runtime + shared upstream; thin per-session stdio shims), **gated by
  identity/credential equivalence**, optional with a direct-bridge fallback
  (#744).

### Phase 6 — Cross-cutting: marker atomicity + vault cutover (#742, #743)

- Atomic `current-version` marker (temp+rename); binstubs prefer last-known-good
  over the newest-slot guess; guess only on true first-run (#742).
- agent-vault adopts the shared drain-safe cutover so a version bump doesn't force
  a re-unlock (#743) — pairs with the #609 clean-room scenario.

### Phase 7 — Reconcile deferred backlog

- Accept process-lifecycle candidates only through
  [`migration-intake`](../migration-intake/README.md)'s deduplication and
  ownership gate.
- Revalidate accepted technical scope against the current service, lease, and
  cutover contracts; return obsolete or unsafe candidates for explicit
  disposition.
- Place each accepted public tracker item in exactly one existing phase,
  extending this plan before implementation when necessary.
- Keep process evidence synthetic and free of machine-specific values.

## Validation Plan

- **Unit tests** for the lease/reaper primitive (Phase 2) and the marker
  atomicity (Phase 6).
- **Clean-room scenarios** (`tools/clean-room/`) for the install/bootstrap/cutover
  changes — extend the existing bridge/vault cutover scenarios (#609) to assert
  **no stranded passive** after repeated same-version starts, and add a
  worktrees resident-tracker refcount/reap scenario.
- **Field before/after** on a host at the target operating point: total agent-\*
  process count, per-service daemon count (assert exactly one active per service),
  count of coexisting versioned installs, and session-launch latency under a burst
  of concurrent launches.
- **Session lifecycle performance** for Phase 4b: focused composition, timeout,
  IPC, and monitor-down fallback tests; process-count and wall-time benchmarks
  proving that the healthy path uses one client launch instead of nine command
  trees; deployed multi-session measurements after cutover.
- **Regression guards:** `check-install-contract.py` clean; version-consistency
  guards green.
- **Lifecycle-policy checks (#625):** docs-consistency guards pass; each named
  plugin has cited evidence for stable launcher, register-once update,
  cutover-on-update, and payload-working-directory safety; every failed item is
  represented by an existing or newly filed public follow-up issue. The new
  declared-tier/escalation-rationale requirement is adopted through #1841 rather
  than treated as evidence that predates the pattern.
- **Adversarial convergence mock (Phase 4b(ii), #2300/#2301):** the six
  scenarios in
  [`adversarial-convergence-mock.md`](adversarial-convergence-mock.md) —
  `flood-against-live-daemon`, `flood-against-absent-daemon`,
  `daemon-appears-mid-flood`, `daemon-dies-mid-packet`,
  `concurrent-daemon-race`, and `process-count-invariant-under-repeated-floods`
  — all PASS, with zero leftover processes (of either the mock daemon or the
  transient client) after the full suite, verified by an OS process census
  before/after (the same technique that found the original
  11-coordinator/68-conhost finding). Per-plugin conformance against the mock's
  validated contract is #2301's own audit, cited here once complete rather than
  re-validated.
- **Classify-pass single-instance lease (Phase 4c):** a concurrent-caller test
  driving two threads/processes through `_classify_records` for the same
  project at once, asserting (a) exactly one performs the actual git
  classification, (b) the other blocks and then observes the winner's
  repaired session-render cache rather than computing (or falling back to) its
  own answer, and (c) neither corrupts the tracking YAML (existing
  `_RecordLock` coverage extended, not replaced). Live reproduction case:
  Picker populate racing an independently-launched `list --json --classify`.
  **Landed** (#2322): 11 new tests plus the existing `TestClassifyRecordsConvo`
  suite unchanged.
- **Resident accelerator daemon (Phase 4d, #2323):** four adversarial mock
  scenarios extending Phase 4b(ii)'s harness — cold-boot-and-wait-for-port,
  concurrent-callers-during-cold-boot, ref-counted-exit-after-linger, and
  fallback-to-direct-computation-on-boot-timeout — each a PASS/FAIL check with
  zero leftover processes, matching this effort's existing validation
  discipline.

## Journal

### 2026-08-18 — Kickoff (Phase 1)

- Audited the framework libs (`versioned-runtime`, `plugin-resolve`, `zdd`,
  `endpoint-rendezvous`, `config-migrate`) and each plugin's install/lifecycle,
  cross-checked against a live host running ~7 concurrent sessions.
- Confirmed the coordinator's post-cutover reap works (a replaced predecessor was
  gone); confirmed the bridge **strands** its previous passive after a
  same-version cutover, and that per-session status-updaters accumulate across
  mixed version paths and pin stale slots.
- Extended `visions/plugin-services` with `single-instance-lease` +
  `work-coalescing-singleton`; filed the umbrella #736 and sub-issues #737–#744.
- Next: Phase 2 (the shared lease + reaper primitive, #737) as the enabler, aligned
  with the upstream process-spawn-guard work so the guard is shared, not
  per-plugin.

### 2026-08-19 — Phases 3-5 landed; Phase 2 primitive extracted; Phase 6 started

Phase 4 & 5 conformance fixes (merged):

- **#741 — agent-mcp version GC on activation** (PR #750). `versioned_runtime.py gc`
  now runs on successful activation, pruning non-current, non-live slots.
- **#739 — agent-worktrees resident status-monitor** (PR #752, then default-on
  opt-out in PR #758). One warm, idle-exiting monitor coalesces the per-session
  status sweeps and is refcounted + reaped on last-consumer exit, retiring the
  per-session status-updater fan-out. Opt-out via
  `AGENT_WORKTREES_STATUS_MONITOR=0`. Realizes the resident-tracker accelerator.
- **#740 — agent-worktrees no-block launch** (PR #755). The marketplace install
  is detached from the launch path (safe because slots are immutable), so a
  burst of session launches no longer serializes on the install lock. Escape
  hatch `WORKTREE_BLOCKING_INSTALL=1`.
- **#738 — bridge stranded-passive leak** — resolved by the generation
  self-retire loop (now default-on / opt-out): a demoted daemon drains and
  exits on its own once a live, strictly-newer generation has taken over, so a
  repeated same-version cutover no longer strands a live passive. The *active*
  reconcile-set reap (retiring strays from the promoted daemon) is available in
  the Phase 2 primitive below and remains to be wired into the cutover path.

Phase 2 — shared primitive extracted (merged):

- **#737 — single-instance-lease** (PR #759). New pure-stdlib shared library
  `libs/single-instance-lease` (vendored like `zdd`) with three pieces:
  `SingleInstance` (an OS-level, liveness-reconciled lease), `is_superseded`
  (the pure fail-safe self-retire decision on a routing-table dict), and
  `reconcile_set_reap` + `superseded_pids_from_table` (the fail-soft reaper;
  process identity is the caller's responsibility, guarding pid reuse).
  agent-bridge's `singleton.py` and `self_retire.py` are now thin adapters over
  it, with the historical lock naming and call shapes unchanged. Realizes the
  `single-instance-lease` vision behavior. Adoption into agent-vault (#743) and
  wiring the reaper into the active cutover path (#738) build on this next.

Phase 6 — cross-cutting (partial):

- **#742 — marker atomicity + last-known-good** (PR #760). The `current-version`
  marker was already written atomically; this landed the read-side preference
  for the canonical agent-worktrees resolver — a 3-tier resolution
  (marker -> `last-known-good` -> newest slot), with the installer stamping
  `last-known-good` on activate. The hot path is unchanged. Rolling the same
  fallback into the other plugins' inlined binstubs is tracked follow-up on #742.

Remaining: Phase 5's optional agent-mcp **multiplexer** (#744, the dominant RAM
consumer — one heavy stdio bridge per session per server collapses to a thin
forwarder + one shared `serve` session-map process); Phase 6's agent-vault
**drain-safe cutover** (#743, now unblocked by the #737 lease primitive); and the
per-plugin last-known-good rollout (#742).

### 2026-09-02 — Phase 4 performance conformance (#918)

- Audited the effective Copilot hook surface and found agent-worktrees launching
  three Python guards before every tool plus two post-tool command trees after
  every successful tool. The bind nudge imported the complete CLI for a tiny
  advisory decision, costing about 2.5 seconds per post-tool event on Windows.
- Consolidated the five commands into one tiny Python client per event class.
  It makes one bounded, token-authenticated request to the resident monitor over
  a dynamic `127.0.0.1:0` endpoint advertised through the monitor's atomic
  liveness-lock/rendezvous record.
  If the monitor is absent, pre-tool safety guards still run together in one
  process; advisory post-tool fallback stays lightweight.
- Promoted the monitor into the warm policy/state owner: delegated roots resolve
  directly from the loaded topology and repo registry (no nested CLI fan-out),
  anchor and topology inputs are cached, nudge lookup uses the active project's
  tracking directory, and bind-nudge is now an in-process decision helper.
- Added a shared status-segment cache with a 60-second maximum age and targeted
  invalidation after mutating tool events. Read-only shell commands remain cache
  hits, multiple sessions on the same worktree share one Git classification,
  and unchanged mux option values are no longer republished every sweep.
- A 20-process local benchmark of the final pre-tool client measured 76.6 ms
  median / 108.7 ms p95, replacing three separate roughly 109-130 ms guard
  launches. The full post-tool CLI import is removed from the hook path.

### 2026-09-02 — Phase 4b session lifecycle audit proposal (#1788)

- The post-deployment baseline showed three dedicated plugin extension hosts per
  active Copilot session (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`, and
  `context-handoff`), each carrying a full extension-host process. Resident
  `agent-worktrees` monitor idle CPU remained low.
- `agent-worktrees` still declares nine separate `sessionStart` commands.
  Synthetic warm-runtime invocation through the same separate PowerShell
  process boundary measured about 21 seconds in aggregate. The largest paths
  were project-hook discovery (~8.4 seconds), session registration
  (~4.7 seconds), and provisioning preview (~3.0 seconds); each imported or
  discovered state independently.
- Filed #1788 and added Phase 4b before implementation. The next slice is to
  design the smallest combined lifecycle request and explicit monitor-down
  fallback, then land focused tests and deployed before/after evidence.

### 2026-09-03 — Lifecycle supervision policy and conformance audit (#625)

- Extended the plugin-services vision with a four-tier, least-privilege
  lifecycle hierarchy: user-mode ensure/auto-run, scheduled activation, system
  service, and consumer-selected container management. Added the stable
  register-once launcher, cutover-on-update, and disposable-payload guarantees.
- Extended `service-lifecycle-supervision` with the capability-based tier
  decision, alignment to the install contract's non-elevated user-mode ensure,
  stable runtime-resolving launchers, and the Windows distinction between
  PowerShell provider location and the inherited Win32 process cwd.
- Audited the three service exemplars:
  - **agent-bridge:** conforms to #625's original four checks: stable launcher,
    register-once, cutover-on-version-update, and payload-cwd safety. Its
    documented stop-and-swap path is only the permitted cutover-failure
    fallback.
  - **agent-dispatch:** the coordinator's stable launcher, ZDD cutover, and
    payload-cwd safety conform. The supervisor task also uses the stable
    launcher, but an ordinary update launched from an elevated shell can still
    force-register an already-correct task; filed #1837.
  - **agent-vault:** payload-cwd safety conforms. Its start path is gated on
    Scheduled Task registration, its lifecycle definitions embed concrete
    runtime slots, and they are rewritten during updates; filed #1836. Its
    separate drain-safe cutover gap remains tracked by #743.
- None of the three architecture docs yet declares the selected tier,
  availability contract, platform mapping, and escalation rationale required by
  the revised pattern. Filed the cross-plugin adoption pass as #1841.
- Self-staged installer copies are intentionally disposable and do not count as
  the original marketplace payload: each audited installer first releases the
  original payload cwd before running from its external staging copy.
- Next: land this reviewed intent/pattern PR, report the evidence and follow-up
  trackers on #625, then close #625 while #1836, #1837, #1841, and #743 carry
  the remaining implementation.

### 2026-09-09 — agent-dispatch supervisor self-update + Phase 4b(ii) design

Landed independently of this effort's own PR sequence, then reconciled into it:

- **#2259 — agent-dispatch supervisor self-update** (PR #2266, then flipped
  default-on + clean-room validated in PR #2280). The `supervise serve`
  singleton daemon had no live version-staleness check, unlike the coordinator
  — a scheduled-task-launched daemon with no periodic trigger could run stale
  indefinitely. Landed opt-in first, then corrected to **default-on / opt-out**
  (`AGENT_DISPATCH_SUPERVISOR_SELF_UPDATE=0`) once it became clear this
  harness's launch paths have no protocol to ever flip an opt-in flag before a
  daemon's first boot — an opt-in gate here would simply never activate for a
  real operator. Validated end-to-end (real spawn, real single-instance lease
  release/reacquire, a genuinely converging successor) by a new Tier-P
  clean-room scenario, `agent-dispatch-supervisor-self-update`, before
  defaulting on.
- **PR #2300 — vision extension.** Grounded in a live process census (11
  separate `agent_dispatch serve` coordinators, 68 `conhost.exe` on one dev
  box) that surfaced while drafting this: extended `visions/plugin-services`
  with **`process-count-scales-with-services-not-sessions`** and
  **`hooks-and-callbacks-are-transient`**, and cross-referenced the invariant
  into the agent-dispatch, agent-bridge, agent-ssh, and agent-worktrees
  visions (the four plugins the operator named as owning exactly one per-host
  daemon). Also fixed a real leak found while grounding the vision text: the
  new clean-room probe's teardown never killed the coordinator it autostarts
  for each isolated HOME (only processes matching its own `--machine` tag),
  now fixed and verified (process count identical before/after a full probe
  run).
- **Reconciling #2301 (filed to track the census/audit work) against this
  effort's own history** — most of what #2301 asks for auditing is **already
  landed here**, just not yet cited back to #2301:
  - #739 (this effort) already landed the agent-worktrees resident
    status-monitor, default-on / opt-out — the exact "exactly one status
    process regardless of session count" guarantee #2301 asks to confirm.
  - #738 (this effort) already resolved the bridge stranded-passive leak via
    generation self-retire (default-on / opt-out) — no code change needed
    there for #2301's ask.
  - #737 (this effort) already landed the shared `single-instance-lease` +
    reaper library agent-bridge's own singleton guard is built on.
  - The 2026-09-02 Phase 4b entry (this effort) already measured and fixed
    agent-worktrees' hook-coalescing (nine command trees → one bounded
    client, 76.6ms median, monitor-down fallback) — this **is**
    `hooks-and-callbacks-are-transient` in practice, with deployed evidence.
  - **Still genuinely open** from #2301: root-causing the *real* (not
    probe-leak) coordinator/conhost proliferation on a live box; confirming
    agent-ssh's `dtssh host --persist` path never starts a second instance;
    and generalizing the *client-side* half of the contract (agent-dispatch,
    agent-bridge, agent-ssh hooks/callbacks reaching their respective
    daemons) the way agent-worktrees already did for its own hooks.
- Added **Phase 4b(ii)** to this effort's Plan: a suite-wide transient-hook-
  client design (generalizing agent-worktrees' own Phase 4b shape) plus an
  adversarial mock harness that validates the contract in the abstract before
  any further per-plugin code change. Full design in
  [`adversarial-convergence-mock.md`](adversarial-convergence-mock.md).
- Next: land this reviewed plan (README + design doc), then build the mock
  harness as its own PR per the review gate, then use its evidence plus a
  narrowed #2301 (comment reconciling the above) to scope any remaining
  per-plugin work.

### 2026-09-09 (later) — Adversarial mock harness landed

- Built `tools/clean-room/scenarios/plugin-process-hygiene-convergence/`: a
  Tier-P, stdlib-only, plugin-agnostic clean-room scenario implementing the
  design's six scenarios against a synthetic mock daemon (no real plugin
  install, no Copilot/gh auth needed). All 6/6 PASS locally, with zero
  leftover processes verified by an OS process census before/after.
- Two real bugs found and fixed **in the harness itself** (not the contract)
  while getting the process-count assertions right:
  - The Windows process-counting helper's own PowerShell query embedded the
    search tag literally in its `-Command` string, so the querying process's
    own command line self-matched the filter, inflating every count. Fixed by
    passing the tag through an environment variable instead of string
    interpolation.
  - PowerShell auto-unwraps a single-element pipeline result to a bare
    scalar object, which has no `.Count` property -- silently printing
    nothing (coerced to 0 by the Python side) whenever *exactly one* process
    matched. Fixed by wrapping the query in `@(...)` to force an array
    regardless of match count. This one is worth remembering generally: any
    future PowerShell-based process census in this suite should force-array
    its `Where-Object` result before reading `.Count`.
- Confirms the contract from the design doc requires no changes; the harness
  needed fixing, not the shape it validates.
- Next: this PR is the mock harness landing per the plan's own checklist;
  #2301's per-plugin audit (citing #737/#738/#739/the Phase 4b measurement as
  already-conforming evidence, and scoping what's genuinely still open) is
  the remaining work this effort's Phase 4b(ii) hands off to.

### 2026-09-09 (later) — Checklist reconciliation

Found the Phase 4b(ii) sub-doc's own checklist a step behind reality while
resuming this effort: PR #2303 (design doc) and PR #2305 (mock harness) were
both already merged, but their own checklist items ("land this design doc",
"land the mock harness as its own PR") were still unticked. Ticked both,
citing the now-merged PR numbers (never the in-flight/self-referential form).
No code or design changes -- purely a bookkeeping catch-up so the next
resumer reads an accurate Plan. The one remaining Phase 4b(ii) checklist item
is unchanged: the per-plugin #2301 audit against the now-validated contract.

### 2026-09-09 (later still) — Phase 4c: classify-pass race found and designed

- **Grounded in a live reproduction**, not a hypothetical: opening a harness
  project's Worktree Manager showed several rows briefly render `WIP`
  then correct themselves to their true state on the very next paint — no app
  reload involved, purely within one open session. Traced to
  `derive._state()`'s fallback (`status == "active" -> WIP if turn_count > 0`),
  which fires whenever a row's `state` field is momentarily absent.
- Disproved the first two hypotheses empirically before settling on this one:
  (1) the session-render-cache write-back (`_stamp_from_raw` /
  `_apply_session_state_stamp`) does land and does so promptly -- confirmed by
  reading a live tracking YAML's `session_state_at` immediately after a
  populate pass matched the observed timing; (2) calling
  `data_local.load(classify=False)` in-process, live, for the exact rows that
  flashed `WIP` returned their correct cached states with no fallback firing --
  so Phase 1 was not the culprit either.
- What *was* found live: a second, independently-parented `agent-worktrees
  ... resolve` -> `list --json --classify` process chain running against the
  same project's tracking directory at the same moment as the Picker's own
  populate -- i.e. two callers of the shared `_classify_records` batch
  classification, for the same project, concurrently, with nothing serializing
  them.
- Added **Phase 4c** to this effort's Plan: apply the Phase 2
  `single-instance-lease` primitive (already vendored, already proven by
  agent-bridge/agent-vault) as a **short critical-section lock** around
  `_classify_records`, per-project, so a second concurrent classify caller
  waits for the winner's pass and re-reads its cache rather than computing (or
  worse, falling back to a wrong heuristic for) its own answer.
- Design-only entry; no plugin code in this PR, per the effort's standing
  convention. The follow-up implementation PR wraps `_classify_records`,
  extends `TestControlPlaneRelatedPRTier`-adjacent coverage with a
  concurrent-caller test (two threads/processes racing the same project,
  asserting the loser observes the winner's repaired cache rather than
  computing its own), and updates the Picker/`cmd_list` call sites only if
  either needs the wait-vs-immediate-return choice made explicit at its layer.

### 2026-09-09 (later still) — Phase 4c implementation landed; vision strengthened; Phase 4d scoped

- **Phase 4c implementation landed** (#2322): `_classify_records` now
  acquires the per-project lease before `_classify_records_live` (the
  original body, factored out unchanged); a losing caller waits (bounded,
  default 15s) then answers via the new `_classify_from_cache` (re-reads each
  record fresh off disk so the winner's stamp is visible, never guesses a
  state); the lease is advisory-only, degrading to live classification on any
  non-contention failure. 11 new tests
  (`tests/test_classify_lease.py`); the existing `TestClassifyRecordsConvo`
  suite required no changes.
- **Vision strengthened in the same sitting** (#2319): the operator's own
  framing of the target end-state — a debounced, globally-reused daemon that
  ref-counts subscribing callers and exits after both its work and its
  subscriber count go to zero — was checked against the visions first, per
  the operator's explicit instruction ("there should be a vision pushing for
  this already"). It mostly wasn't: `visions/plugin-services`'s
  `hooks-and-callbacks-are-transient` was scoped to Copilot-invoked hooks
  only, and `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees`'s "Derived status" section
  described the resident monitor as merely optional. Both were strengthened:
  the hook behavior generalizes to any repeated caller of a
  work-coalescing-singleton, and agent-worktrees now states the thin-client/
  ref-counted-subscriber/bounded-linger expectation explicitly, naming direct
  computation as the correct degrade path rather than the steady-state
  target.
- **Phase 4d added** (#2323): the daemon architecture itself — a new request
  kind on `hook_ipc.py`'s existing TCP surface, the resident status-monitor
  as the daemon, explicit subscriber ref-counting replacing today's TTL/
  demand-inference, and (flagged during design, load-bearing for
  implementation) a client-side cold-start timeout budget separate from
  `hook_ipc`'s existing 1s hook-decision timeout, with an explicit fallback to
  Phase 4c's lease (not superseded) when no daemon is reachable in time.
  Design-only; a reviewed design PR precedes any plugin code, per this
  effort's standing convention.

### 2026-09-09 (later still) — Phase 4b(ii)'s per-plugin audit landed on #2301

Closed Phase 4b(ii)'s last open checklist item: a direct-read audit of
agent-worktrees, agent-bridge, agent-dispatch, and agent-ssh against the
mock-validated transient-hook-client contract, posted as a
[#2301 comment](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2301#issuecomment-5613535208)
rather than re-litigated here. Verdicts: **agent-worktrees CONFORMS**
(`hook_client.py` never spawns; `_ensure_status_monitor` is off the hook path
entirely, confirmed by grep); **agent-bridge PARTIAL** (its
`bootstrap-check.ps1` background-spawn was fixed same-day by #2317,
`write-session-guidance.ps1` left unverified); **agent-dispatch DEVIATES**
(confirmed, unfixed — same ungated `Start-Process -FilePath 'conhost.exe'`
shape #2317 fixed elsewhere); **agent-ssh SPLIT** (same hook deviation, but
its actual persistent daemon, `dtssh-host-launcher.ps1`, conforms via a named
Mutex). The 8 further sibling plugins #2317 named are explicitly flagged as
*that PR's* claim, not independently re-verified by this audit — the comment
is deliberately careful not to let an unverified list masquerade as a
finding.

Resolution recorded there and here: the confirmed deviations are **not**
fixed by fanning out #2317's opt-in-gate pattern to each sibling. A new
effort, [`tiered-payload-provisioning`](../tiered-payload-provisioning/README.md)
(created earlier the same day from an operator critique that gating "only
changes who pays the cost, not whether it's expensive"), removes the
expensive hook-triggered path entirely via a unified, serialized/debounced
stamp-now/provision-on-first-use model applying to every version update. Its
Phase 3 is where agent-dispatch's and agent-ssh's confirmed deviations
actually get fixed — this effort's Phase 4b(ii) is now fully closed, with
implementation handed off rather than duplicated into a new phase here.

### 2026-09-10 — Worktree-scoped registrar pointer: a distinct root cause (#2417)

A live incident on a shared dev box ("agent-dispatch ran amok spawning headed
processes") led to a newly-diagnosed, **distinct** contributing bug — related
to this effort's theme but not part of the Phase 4b(ii) hook-transience audit
above, which is already closed:

- **Root cause**: `agent-dispatch reviewer-loop setup` / `repository-issue-loop
  setup` (and their shared `status`/`doctor`/`enable`/`disable` declaration
  loader) derived a declaration's registration **owner** from raw filesystem
  path structure (`repo_root.name`), with zero awareness of worktree-vs-anchor
  identity. Run from inside a worktree checkout instead of the repo's
  registered anchor, this silently registered a **permanent global pointer**
  (in `~/.agent-dispatch/registrar/pointers.json`) scoped to that worktree's
  ephemeral directory name. Because the resulting registration id is unique
  per worktree, it never reconciled with prior registrations, so every
  occurrence spawned a **brand-new set of headed reviewer-loop workers** that
  worktree deletion never cleaned up.
- Traced the exact trigger: the `missing-pointer` doctor diagnostic literally
  suggests `agent-dispatch reviewer-loop setup <relative-path>` as its fix
  action — an agent following that suggestion from inside a worktree is
  exactly how this fires. Confirmed via evidence on the affected machine: a
  `dotfiles` worktree's declared registrations were already disabled (by a
  different agent noticing the runaway spawns) and the bad pointer entry was
  already removed from `pointers.json` — contained, but the code path that
  produced it was still live.
- Filed as issue #2417 with full code-level root cause and fix directions.
- **Landed the fix** (this entry's own change): added
  `_reject_worktree_checkout_as_repo_root()`, wired into both
  `_reviewer_loop_declarations` and `_repository_issue_loop_declarations` (the
  shared chokepoint both `setup` paths and every other reviewer-loop/
  repository-issue-loop subcommand funnel through). Deliberately a **cheap,
  dependency-free path-pattern check** (does the parent directory name end in
  `.worktrees`, this harness's own worktree-root naming convention) rather
  than an authoritative subprocess probe out to `agent-worktrees`: an early
  subprocess-based version of this guard measured ~9s per invocation on this
  loaded box, which would have made every reviewer-loop CLI call slow exactly
  when the host is already struggling — the wrong tradeoff for what should be
  a fast safety check. Added a regression test
  (`test_setup_refuses_worktree_checkout_path`) proving a worktree-scoped
  declaration is refused rather than silently registered. Full agent-dispatch
  suite: 2410 passed, 3 pre-existing unrelated failures (bootstrap/session-
  guidance tests, confirmed untouched by this diff), 8 skipped.
- **Extended `visions/plugin-services`** with the operator-directed strong
  invariant this bug violates: **`identity-resolves-by-name-not-path`** — the
  only place a repo's current filesystem path may ever be recorded is its
  owning registry (e.g. `repos.yaml`/`projects.yaml`); every other component
  (a registrar pointer, a registered task's repo binding, a scheduled-task
  action) carries the repo's **name** and resolves the path fresh at the
  point of use. Added companion Behaviors `refuse-not-silently-misidentify`
  and `registered-tasks-target-by-name`. Cross-referenced from
  `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees` (the canonical name-to-path registry
  owner) and `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch` (the registrar pointer
  convention this incident hit directly).
- Not yet done: a broader audit of "task registrations specify at most agent
  or repo names" and "scheduled tasks only invoke installed binstubs" across
  the rest of the suite, per the operator's full ask. The scheduled-task half
  is likely already covered by the existing `Stable lifecycle launcher`
  concept + `register-once-cutover-on-update` behavior (audited for
  agent-bridge/agent-dispatch/agent-vault under #625), but that audit
  predates this new, more general invariant and should be re-checked against
  it explicitly as a follow-up.

### 2026-09-11 — Scheduled-task binstub audit re-checked against `identity-resolves-by-name-not-path` (#736 follow-up)

Re-confirmed the #625 scheduled-task audit against the new invariant, by
citing the concrete `Action` construction for each service exemplar:

- **agent-bridge** (`scripts/install.ps1` `Register-ScheduledTask_`): action
  is `conhost.exe --headless pwsh -File "$launcherPath"` where `$launcherPath`
  is the stable `start-agent-bridge.ps1` written into `$InstallDir` (never a
  versioned slot path). The launcher body itself resolves the active version
  from the `current-version` marker at **every run** ("SINGLE routing point
  ... never a pinned path").
- **agent-dispatch** (coordinator + supervisor + embody-supervisor tasks):
  all three actions are `conhost.exe --headless powershell.exe -File
  "$launcher"` with a stable launcher in `$InstallDir`
  (`serve-service.ps1`/`supervise-service.ps1`); each launcher re-resolves
  `$_py` from the `current-version` marker via the shared
  `resolve-runtime.ps1` chain at every run, matching agent-bridge's pattern.
- **agent-vault** (`Register-AgentVaultTask`): action is `conhost.exe
  --headless powershell.exe -File "$TaskLauncher"`, `$TaskLauncher` stable in
  `$InstallDir`. Its slot python IS baked into the launcher body's `& '<path>'`
  line at registration time rather than re-resolved per run -- a real but
  **already-tracked** deviation (filed as #1836 during the original #625
  audit; the task is re-registered on every install/update so it does not go
  stale between reinstalls, but it is not per-run dynamic like the other two).
  No new gap beyond #1836.
- Spot-checked the 3 other plugins that also register Scheduled Tasks
  (agent-logger, agent-codespaces, agent-index): all follow the identical
  `conhost.exe --headless ... -File "<stable $InstallDir launcher>"` shape,
  no raw versioned-slot or worktree path in any `Action`.

**Conclusion: no new conformance gap.** All scheduled-task actions target a
name-stable, installed launcher, never a worktree-scoped or raw versioned-slot
path; agent-vault's known per-update (not per-run) slot resolution remains
tracked separately by #1836.

Also re-verified #2417/#2421 has no coverage gap: traced both
`_reviewer_loop_setup` and `_repository_issue_loop_setup` -- each calls its
sibling `_..._declarations()` helper (which invokes
`_reject_worktree_checkout_as_repo_root`) **before** its own `rd.add_pointer`
call, so a worktree-checkout path is refused before any pointer is persisted.
Manually reproduced against a `dotfiles.worktrees\<id>\.agent-dispatch\
registrar\reviewer.json` declaration: `reviewer-loop setup` returns non-zero
with the expected refusal message; no pointer written. `repository-issue-loop
setup`'s existing regression test (`test_setup_refuses_worktree_checkout_path`)
passes. Grepped the rest of `agent_dispatch` for other
`repo_root_from_surface_path`/`f"repo:{...root.name}"` call sites: none found
outside the two guarded declaration helpers.

**Live daemon-status re-check:** `agent-dispatch supervise daemon-status`
still shows the original 6 `declared:repo:owner_user-cloud1-win-20260910-171507-5474:*`
/ `logical:repo:...` override entries from the #2417 incident, but all are
`disabled: true` with `at` timestamps (~2026-09-11T00:31Z) that **predate**
#2421's merge (2026-09-11T02:57Z) -- confirming these are the original
contained incident, not a recurrence. No new `declared:repo:<worktree-id>:...`
entries have appeared since the fix landed.

This closes out the scheduled-task-binstub audit slice of the operator's full
ask; the #736 umbrella's own remaining sub-issues (#738, #742, #743, #744)
are unrelated open work tracked separately above.

### 2026-09-11 (later) — Landed #1837 fix (force-register-on-elevated-update)

Fixed the `agent-dispatch` boot-mode supervisor task registration gap found
during the audit above: `Install-SupervisorTaskInstance` used the caller's
elevation state as a proxy for "does the task need re-registering", so an
elevated update always fell through to `Register-ScheduledTask -Force` even
when the existing task's action already matched the desired one. Now compares
the registered task's `Action` (Execute/Arguments/WorkingDirectory) against
the one the update would produce; a match means already-correct regardless of
elevation (cycle in place via `Restart-SupervisorTaskInPlace`), and
re-registration is reserved for a missing task or a genuine definition drift.
A drift with no elevation available degrades to an in-place restart of the
stale task (warned) rather than silently no-op'ing the migration. Full
`agent-dispatch` suite: `test_supervisor_install.py` 42/42; the other 37
failures observed in a full-suite run are pre-existing installed-venv/source
version skew (build-info/procutil/task-transition tests unrelated to this
change), confirmed absent from this diff's touched files. Landed via
[ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions#1837](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/1837).

### 2026-09-11 (later still) — Landed the Windows half of #1836

Fixed agent-vault's Windows Scheduled Task: `Register-AgentVaultTask` used to
resolve the active versioned slot ONCE at registration time and bake that
concrete `versions/<v>/Scripts/python.exe` path into the launcher script body
-- so an activated version cutover only took effect once the task was
re-registered (every install/update rewrote it, masking the issue in
practice, but a hand-invoked `Start-ScheduledTask` between updates could run a
stale slot). Moved the `resolve-runtime.ps1` dot-source into the launcher body
itself, so it resolves the active slot fresh at every process start --
matching agent-bridge's/agent-dispatch's launchers exactly ("SINGLE routing
point... never a pinned path"). Also added the same register-once guard as
#1837: `Register-AgentVaultTask` now compares the existing task's `Action`
against the desired one and skips `Set-ScheduledTask` when they already
match, reserving re-registration for a genuine definition drift. Confirmed
via `resolve-runtime.ps1`/`ExecStart=$LINK_PYTHON` review that the POSIX
systemd-unit side does NOT have this bug: `.venv/bin/python` is a real symlink
re-pointed at every activate (no Windows-junction RedirectionGuard problem),
so `ExecStart`'s baked path already tracks the active version correctly --
no POSIX change needed. Added two regression tests
(`test_scheduled_task_launcher_resolves_slot_at_every_run`,
`test_scheduled_task_registration_skips_reregister_when_already_correct`);
full `agent-vault` suite: 255 passed (2 pre-existing, unrelated WSL-bash
path-translation failures in `test_bootstrap_check_reconcile_opt_in.py`,
confirmed present before this diff). Bumped to `0.1.0-dev101`.

**Deliberately NOT attempted this session** (the larger, riskier half of
#1836's ask, left open): decoupling `Invoke-Start`/session-start readiness
from Scheduled Task existence entirely (a "user-mode ensure" fallback that
can cold-start the daemon without a registered task at all). agent-vault is a
credential store; a behavior change to its start path deserves its own
focused pass with more test coverage than this session budgeted, rather than
folding it into the same diff as the launcher-resolution fix. #1836 stays
open for that remaining piece.

### 2026-09-11 (later still) — Closed the rest of #1836: `start` no longer depends on the Scheduled Task

Operator confirmed agent-vault is lightly used on this machine and cleared it
for direct experimentation, so picked back up the deferred piece. Discovered
`agent_vault.cli` **already has** its own idempotent, health-gated user-mode
ensure path independent of any Scheduled Task -- `cmd_start` ->
`ensure_service`/`start_service` (pings first, cold-starts via `sys.executable`
if not running, polls until healthy). `install.ps1`'s `Invoke-Start` just
never delegated to it: it hard-required a registered task and errored
otherwise. Fixed by making `Invoke-Start` prefer the Scheduled Task when
registered (keeps Task Scheduler's own crash-restart policy for the at-logon
case) and fall back to `& $LinkPython -m agent_vault start` -- the exact same
path the CLI itself uses -- when no task exists, rather than reimplementing
process-spawning logic in PowerShell. Added
`test_start_does_not_require_a_registered_scheduled_task`.

**Live-verified on this machine** (not just unit tests): stopped the running
daemon, `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName AgentVault`, ran the patched
`install.ps1 start` -- daemon came up and answered `ping` with no task
registered. Re-ran `install.ps1 update` twice in a row to confirm both the
#1836 launcher-resolution fix and the register-once guard: first run built +
activated `0.1.0-dev102` and registered the task fresh; second run printed
"Scheduled task already correct ... left registered as-is" (no
Set-ScheduledTask). Restored the task registration afterward so the machine
is back to its normal running state. Full suite: 258 passed, same 2
pre-existing unrelated failures. Bumped to `0.1.0-dev102`.

**#1836 is now fully closed** -- both the launcher-resolution/register-once
half and the start/session-start convergence half are landed.

### 2026-09-11 (later still) — Closed #742's remaining follow-up: per-plugin inlined binstubs

The 2026-08-19 journal entry landed #742's read-side 3-tier fallback
(marker -> last-known-good -> newest slot) into the canonical
`libs/versioned-runtime/resolve-runtime.{sh,ps1}` resolver, but flagged
"rolling the same fallback into the other plugins' inlined binstubs" as
follow-up. Audited every plugin's Windows Scheduled Task / service launcher
generator for an INLINED copy of this resolution (i.e. one that reads
`current-version` directly rather than dot-sourcing the shared resolver) and
found three that skipped straight from the marker to a raw newest-slot guess
with no last-known-good tier:

- **agent-bridge** `Register-ScheduledTask_`'s `$launcherBody` (the
  `start-agent-bridge.ps1` it writes).
- **agent-dispatch**'s coordinator (`serve-service.ps1`) AND embody-supervisor
  (`supervise-service.ps1`) launcher generators -- byte-identical resolution
  block duplicated in both.
- **agent-index**'s `Get-ActiveSlotPython` (used by the sessionStart `ensure`
  reconcile to find the currently-serving slot without dragging it backward).

All three now insert the same last-known-good tier the shared resolver uses,
between the marker read and the newest-slot guess. (agent-vault's equivalent
launcher no longer has an inlined resolution at all after this session's
earlier #1836 fix -- it now dot-sources the shared resolver directly, so it
was never part of this gap.) The other plugins with a `bin/<name>` payload
shim (agent-containers, agent-machines, agent-mcp, agent-vault, etc.) all
route through `runtime-gate.{sh,ps1}`, which itself dot-sources the shared
resolver -- confirmed already conformant, not part of this gap.

**Caught and fixed a real authoring bug while verifying:** the inserted
comment text `` `activate()` `` inside the two here-string-embedded copies
(agent-bridge, agent-dispatch) triggered PowerShell's here-string backtick
escaping -- `` `a `` is the alert-character escape, not a literal backtick+a
-- silently corrupting the rendered comment to "ctivate()" with an embedded
BEL byte. Caught by actually rendering the launcher (an isolated
`-InstallDir` test install, not the production runtime) and reading the
generated file rather than trusting the parser's happy "no syntax errors"
verdict alone; fixed by dropping the backticks from that one word in the two
heredoc copies (agent-index's copy isn't inside a here-string, so it was
unaffected).

**Verified functionally**, not just by parse-check: rendered agent-bridge's
launcher via an isolated temp `-InstallDir` install (never touching this
machine's real agent-bridge runtime) and simulated a marker-missing/
last-known-good-present scenario against the rendered file directly --
resolved to the last-known-good slot as expected. Did the same inline
simulation for agent-dispatch's and agent-index's resolution blocks against
synthetic version directories, all resolving correctly and never falling
through to the newest-slot guess when last-known-good was available.
Deliberately did NOT run the full install/service-registration flow for
agent-bridge/agent-dispatch against their real installs on this machine
(unlike agent-vault, these are actively relied on by this very session) --
isolated `-InstallDir` installs and direct logic simulation were the
lower-risk validation path.

`tools/check-install-contract.py` and `tools/sync-versioned-runtime.py
--check` both green (these inlined blocks are outside the byte-identical
install-contract sections, so unaffected by either check, as expected -- this
is exactly the gap those checks don't cover, which is why the fallback had to
be rolled out by hand per occurrence). Added regression tests per plugin
(`test_install_ps1_last_known_good.py` x2,
`test_get_active_slot_python_last_known_good.py`). Full test suites: agent-
dispatch's own `test_supervisor_install.py` + new test 44/44; agent-index 508
passed / 11 failed -- all 11 pre-existing environment gaps (missing `numpy`/
`mcp` optional deps in the installed venv, and an ambient `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT`
leaking from this very session's own environment into a subprocess test that
doesn't scrub it), confirmed unrelated to the touched files; agent-bridge
1870 passed / 576 failed, all in modules the diff never touches (transport,
SSE stream, startup supersession, watchdog) -- consistent with the
already-documented installed-venv/source version-skew pattern from this
effort's #1837 entry, not a regression from this change. Bumped agent-bridge
to `0.4.0-dev472`, agent-dispatch to `0.1.2-dev77`, agent-index to
`0.1.0-dev164`.

**#742 is now fully closed.**

### 2026-09-11 (much later) — Landed #743: agent-vault drain-safe cutover (POSIX)

Discovered `agent_vault.cutover` (the security-critical handoff mechanism --
`build_handoff_payload`/`apply_handoff_payload`/`handoff_export_response`,
gated to the owner-only AF_UNIX socket, `handoff-export` already wired into
`service.handle_request`) already existed and was already exhaustively unit-
tested, but nothing actually INVOKED it: no orchestration wired it into
`install.sh update`, and there was no way for a not-yet-running new
generation to receive/apply the payload at all.

Closed the gap with two additions, both security-conscious about where the
plaintext master password can go:

1. **`service.py` CLI surface**: `--export-handoff` (client-side: ask the
   currently-running daemon to export its unlocked state, print one line of
   JSON to stdout, or nothing -- never raises, a safe silent degrade) and
   `--handoff-stdin` (daemon-side: consume a pending payload -- via the
   `AGENT_VAULT_HANDOFF_JSON` env var, or stdin as fallback -- and apply it
   BEFORE any fork/daemonize, so it survives into the detached child via
   copy-on-write memory). Extracted the env-var/stdin consumption into
   `cutover.consume_pending_handoff()` for unit-testability.
2. **`install.sh`'s `_install_service()`**: before touching the systemd unit,
   if a generation is already active, capture its handoff payload (with the
   env vars `config.py`/`send_command` need EXPLICITLY set for that one
   subprocess call -- a real bug caught in testing, see below). Pass it to
   the successor via `systemctl --user set-environment
   AGENT_VAULT_HANDOFF_JSON=...` set immediately before `restart` and unset
   immediately after (`restart` blocks until the start job completes, and
   `--handoff-stdin` pops the var at the very start of `main()`) -- never
   written to the unit file, never persisted to disk.

Updated `cutover.py`'s module docstring to describe the two distinct legs
(outgoing-daemon -> installer: AF_UNIX-only, unchanged; installer -> not-yet-
running successor: env var or stdin, a same-user process-launch carrier, not
an inter-daemon crossing) rather than overstating the original "never an env
var" line now that a second, differently-scoped carrier exists.

**Deliberately out of scope**: Windows. The named pipe is not proven owner-
gated (per the existing code's own comment), so `request_handoff_from_running_
daemon()` already safely returns `None` there and the update path degrades to
the existing re-unlock, exactly per invariant #3 in
`docs/patterns/graceful-daemon-cutover.md`. Hardening the pipe's DACL to make
Windows eligible is a separate, larger, security-sensitive task, not folded
into this change.

**Verified for real, not just unit-tested** -- this machine has WSL Ubuntu
with a real, already-running production agent-vault instance
(`~/.agent-vault`, PID 483, untouched throughout), so every test ran against
a fully isolated install (`--install-dir /tmp/av743` +
`AGENT_VAULT_INSTALLATION_ID=test743`, its own systemd unit name/socket/TCP
port -- confirmed the real instance's PID never changed):
- Installed `keepassxc` fresh in WSL, created a real throwaway `.kdbx`,
  unlocked it against the isolated daemon over the real IPC protocol.
- Ran the actual `install.sh update` path twice. First attempt exposed a real
  bug (env vars not exported for the `--export-handoff` subprocess call --
  fixed) and a second pre-existing, unrelated bug this surfaced (`$RUN_DIR`/
  `logs` were never `mkdir -p`'d before the daemon's first bind, so a fresh
  POSIX install crash-loops on `sock.bind` -- fixed; tightly coupled to
  testing this change, since it blocks daemon startup at all).
- After the fix: `journalctl` showed "Drain-safe cutover: warmed 1 vault(s)
  from predecessor handoff" on the successor PID, and a direct IPC `ping`
  against the NEW pid confirmed `cli=unlocked` with the vault listed in
  `unlocked_vaults` -- no re-unlock, a genuinely new process.
- Cleaned up the isolated test unit/install dir afterward; confirmed the
  real WSL production daemon (PID 483) was never touched.

Added 13 new unit tests to `test_cutover.py` (client export mocking + env-
var/stdin consumption); full suite 268 passed (same 2 pre-existing unrelated
WSL-bash path failures). `check-install-contract.py` / `sync-versioned-
runtime.py --check` / `check-version-consistency.py` all green; `bash -n`
clean. Bumped to `0.1.0-dev103`.

**#743 is now closed** for the transport where it is actually safe today
(POSIX/systemd); the Windows named-pipe DACL hardening that would extend it
there remains explicitly out of scope.

Remaining #736-adjacent open work not picked up this session: #744
(work-coalescing singleton tier design).

### 2026-09-12 — #744 design doc: `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md`

Picked up #744 (the only remaining #736 sub-issue). Per the effort's own
design-first sequencing convention, landed the **design doc** first, before
any helper/consumer code:

- New `docs/patterns/work-coalescing-singleton.md`, generalizing
  `agent-worktrees`' existing `hook_ipc.py`/`list_cache.py` (the reference
  implementation) into a reusable shape: the wire protocol (subscribe /
  coalesced request / release), the two-phase timeout budget (boot-wait vs.
  per-request deadline — a cold classify pass and a cold MCP server boot need
  far more than the existing 1s hot-hook-decision timeout), the explicit
  ref-count + bounded-linger idle-exit algorithm (liveness-reaped, not only
  clean-disconnect, so a crashed subscriber can't pin the daemon up forever),
  and the always-correct inline fallback invariant.
- Named the two consumers against this shared shape: **#2323** (agent-
  worktrees resident classify/list accelerator — still open, not yet
  implemented; verified via `gh issue view 2323` rather than assumed done)
  and the **agent-mcp multiplexer** (not started — a per-`(host, server)`
  daemon strictly gated by identity/credential equivalence, with a direct-
  bridge fallback).
- Added new validation scenarios for the adversarial mock harness (extending
  Phase 4b(ii)'s existing suite): cold-boot-and-wait-for-port, concurrent-
  callers-during-cold-boot, ref-counted-exit-after-linger, fallback-to-
  direct-computation-on-boot-timeout, and (agent-mcp-specific) credential-
  mismatch-never-pools.
- Added a row to `docs/patterns/README.md`'s index.
- Deliberately **not** in this PR (per the effort's own guidance not to
  treat #744 as a quick mechanical fix): the reusable `libs/work-coalescing-
  singleton/` helper extraction, and both consumer implementations (#2323's
  daemon extension, the agent-mcp multiplexer itself). Each is its own
  follow-up PR on top of this design, landed independently.

Remaining under #744 (and thus #736): extract the reusable helper library;
implement #2323 against it; implement the agent-mcp multiplexer against it.
None of these should land as one large diff — see the design doc's own
"Sequencing" section.

### 2026-09-12 (later) — #744 reusable helper: `libs/work-coalescing-singleton/`

Landed the reusable helper named as the design doc's next Sequencing step:

- New pure-stdlib `libs/work-coalescing-singleton/` (package
  `agent-work-coalescing-singleton`, import `work_coalescing_singleton`), not
  yet vendored into any consuming plugin (no second consumer exists yet;
  `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` only activates once a lib has ≥2
  copies, so this canonical copy alone doesn't trip it — same shape as
  `libs/single-instance-lease/` before its own first plugin adoption).
- `server.CoalescingServer`: the daemon side. Coalesces identical
  `(kind, key)` requests onto one in-flight execution (joiners share the
  owner's result or its raised error, never recompute); explicit
  subscribe/release ref-counting plus an implicit `touch` for
  fire-and-forget callers; a bounded **linger** timer that only starts at
  refcount zero and is cancelled by any new subscriber; a background
  **liveness reaper** that drops a subscriber whose last-seen timestamp
  exceeds its TTL (a crashed client can't pin the daemon alive forever).
- `client`: pure functions over a resolved `(host, port, token)` endpoint —
  `subscribe`/`release`/`request`, and `call_with_fallback` (the full
  boot-wait → request → inline-fallback sequence in one call, never raising
  past it). Rendezvous/discovery and daemon-boot stay each consumer's own
  responsibility, same as today.
- **14 tests, all passing**: unit tests drive `CoalescingServer` directly
  (coalescing, distinct-key independence, error propagation to every
  joiner, deadline-expiry without blocking the owner, linger/liveness-reap
  timing) plus full-wire tests over a real loopback TCP socket (subscribe/
  request/release round trip, concurrent coalescing across two real client
  connections, a wrong-token request rejected without crashing the server,
  and `call_with_fallback`'s three paths — no daemon, daemon answers, and
  daemon exceeds the request deadline).
- **Found and fixed a real bug during testing, not just added tests**: the
  first test run hung indefinitely. `CoalescingServer.close()` unconditionally
  called `socketserver`'s `shutdown()`, which blocks forever waiting for a
  `serve_forever()` loop that a unit test exercising `handle_request`/
  refcounting directly (without calling `.start()`) never started. Fixed
  by tracking a `_started` flag and only awaiting the serve/reap threads
  when they were actually started.
- `ruff check` clean; `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` and
  `tools/check-docs-consistency.py` both green.
- Updated the design doc's own "Sequencing" section to mark the helper
  landed and point at the still-open consumers.

Remaining under #744 (and thus #736): #2323 (agent-worktrees resident
classify/list accelerator) and the agent-mcp multiplexer each still need to
adopt this helper — each its own vendored copy, its own reviewed PR, per the
design doc's Sequencing section. Neither has started.

### 2026-09-12 (later still) — #2323: agent-worktrees adopts the helper (wire layer only)

Investigated #2323 (agent-worktrees resident classify/list accelerator)
before writing any code: read `hook_ipc.py` (the existing resident-monitor
IPC listener), `list_cache.py` (the existing file-based, TTL + demand-
registered coalescing-like cache already in production), and
`cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records` in `__main__.py` (the ~25k-line
monolith this session's own worktree tooling runs live). Two load-bearing
findings shaped the scope kept for this PR:

- `hook_client.py` (the standalone script every session-lifecycle hook
  invokes) hard-requires a `capabilities` field naming
  `"session-lifecycle-v1"` in the response envelope — the generalized
  `work_coalescing_singleton` wire shape doesn't carry that field. Refactoring
  `hook_ipc.py` into a thin adapter (as this effort did for
  `single_instance_lease` in agent-bridge) would mean also touching
  `hook_client.py`, on the exact hot path every concurrent session's startup/
  shutdown hook depends on **right now**, including this session's own. Not
  worth the risk without dedicated, isolated testing.
- `list_cache.py` + the resident sweep's `_warm_list_cache_for_active_project`
  already implement a working, tested, **file-based** coalescing-like tier
  (demand registration + short TTL + resident-refreshed extended freshness) —
  not the live-IPC push #2323 envisions, but real, shipped mitigation of the
  same underlying problem. The remaining gap is narrower than the original
  issue framing suggested: an IPC upgrade is a latency/freshness improvement
  over polling, not a missing correctness property.

Given both, landed only the **wire-adoption layer**, not the live-monolith
wiring, in this PR:

- Vendored `libs/work-coalescing-singleton/` into
  `plugins/agent-worktrees/libs/work-coalescing-singleton/` (byte-identical
  copy; `tools/check-vendored-libs-sync.py` green) and added it to
  `pyproject.toml` (`agent-work-coalescing-singleton`, `[tool.uv.sources]`
  pinned to the local path, matching the `single-instance-lease` convention
  exactly).
- New `agent_worktrees/classify_daemon.py`: `start_server`/`rendezvous_fields`
  (the daemon side, namespaced `classify_*` lock-file fields so they can't
  collide with `HookIpcServer`'s existing fields) and `classify_via_daemon`
  (the client side — try a live daemon if `lock_data` already names one,
  else run the caller's `fallback` immediately; **never boots a daemon
  itself**, since a resident monitor's launch/idle-exit lifecycle stays its
  existing owner's responsibility). Explicitly documented in the module's
  own docstring as not yet wired into any command.
- 6 new tests (`tests/test_classify_daemon.py`): rendezvous fields round-trip,
  malformed/absent rendezvous rejected without raising, fallback used with no
  daemon, live daemon used when reachable, fallback on deadline exceeded, and
  two concurrent callers for the same project coalescing into one execution.
  All pass. Also re-ran the closely related existing suites
  (`test_classify_lease.py`, `test_hook_ipc.py`, `test_status_monitor.py`,
  `test_list_cache.py` — 173 tests) to confirm the vendoring + `pyproject.toml`
  change caused zero regression. `ruff check` clean;
  `check-vendored-libs-sync.py`, `check-docs-consistency.py`,
  `check-version-consistency.py` all green.
- Updated the design doc's Sequencing section to reflect this "helper
  vendored + wire wrappers landed, live wiring still open" state precisely.

**Deliberately not done** (the actual remaining #2323 scope): starting this
daemon inside `cmd_status_monitor` and publishing its rendezvous alongside
`HookIpcServer`'s; trying it from `_classify_records` before the existing
`single_instance_lease` path. The concrete plan for that follow-up: the
daemon's `compute(kind, payload)` callback resolves a project's records
itself via `tracking.list_records(...)` (never serializing whole records
over the wire — the request payload only needs to name the project), builds
whatever `session_ctx` the existing classify pass needs, and calls
`_classify_records_live` directly; `_classify_records` reads the resident
monitor's lock file first, and calls `classify_daemon.classify_via_daemon`
with `fallback=` the existing (renamed, otherwise unchanged)
lease-guarded body. That change touches the live monolith this session's
own tooling depends on and deserves its own dedicated pass with a spawned,
non-production test monitor exercising the full round trip before landing
— not bundled into this PR.

Remaining under #744 (and thus #736): the `_classify_records`/
`cmd_status_monitor` wiring described above, and the agent-mcp multiplexer
(still fully unstarted).

### 2026-09-12 (much later) — Correction: the agent-mcp multiplexer was ALREADY DONE; landed its last follow-up (#866)

Before starting agent-mcp work, `gh issue view 744`'s own **comments** (not
just its body) revealed a load-bearing mistake in this journal and in the
design doc: the agent-mcp multiplexer is **not** unstarted. It shipped in
five already-merged slices, entirely before this session picked up #744
today:

- Slice 1 — `BridgeSession` extraction + resident `serve` session-host
  foundation (#763).
- Slice 2 — thin `agent-mcp forward` stdio<->socket child + lazy CLI
  imports (#861).
- Slice 3 — `serve`-host single-instance lease + idle-evict + forwarder
  ensure-serve (#863).
- Slice 4 — made the forwarder genuinely thin (asyncio-free `sockio`,
  lazy `__version__`) and proved the RAM win: ~20%/~54 MiB saved on 7
  sessions (#864).
- Default-on flip — `agent-mcp bridge` now routes through the thin
  forwarder by default, opt-out via `AGENT_MCP_NO_MULTIPLEX` (#865).

Per the issue's own last comment: "#744 status — the multiplexer is
functionally complete", with only one item left: **#866**, a clean-room
process-topology scenario (the RAM win was proven by an ad hoc
`examples/multiplexer_ab.py` A/B script, but the effort's validation plan
also calls for a deterministic clean-room assertion of the process
topology itself). **Correcting the record**: earlier today's PR #2498
(design doc) and this journal's own entries describing the agent-mcp
multiplexer as "not started"/"fully unstarted" were wrong — I should have
read the issue's comments, not just its body, before writing that. The
design doc has been corrected in this same change.

**Landed #866**: `tools/clean-room/scenarios/agent-mcp-multiplexer/` (Tier-P
F1, modeled on `agent-bridge-cutover`'s probe-script pattern):

- `fixtures/multiplexer_topology_probe.py` — a portable, stdlib-only,
  Linux-`/proc`-based probe (reusing `examples/multiplexer_ab.py`'s
  echo-upstream/spawn/drive/census techniques) with three checks, each
  emitting `PROBE: <name> PASS|FAIL <detail>`:
  - `topology-collapse` — N (4) `agent-mcp forward` sessions against one
    shared upstream config collapse onto **exactly one** resident `serve`
    host + N thin forwarders (never N heavy bridges), each session still
    answering `initialize`/`tools/list` correctly through it.
  - `direct-fallback` — `AGENT_MCP_NO_MULTIPLEX=1` runs N independent direct
    bridges with **zero** resident hosts spawned.
  - `idle-self-eviction` — a `serve` host started with a short
    `--idle-timeout` evicts itself once its last attached forwarder detaches.
- `manifest.json` + `scenario.sh` (install ONLY agent-mcp, provision, run the
  probe), following the exact `agent-bridge-cutover` shape (phases,
  `_resolve_slot_python`, `jam`/`pass`/`fail` conventions).
- **Verified for real, not just written**: this machine's WSL Ubuntu has a
  real installed agent-mcp runtime (`~/.agent-mcp`, version `0.2.0-dev81`,
  no live `serve` daemon running beforehand). Ran the probe directly against
  that real slot python (never inside the actual clean-room Docker rig,
  which this session didn't drive end-to-end) — all three checks passed, 3
  full-sequence reruns in a row (9/9), and confirmed afterward that the real
  install's `current-version` was untouched and zero `agent_mcp` processes
  were left running. One early ad hoc run (outside the final probe code)
  intermittently reported a stray process under back-to-back manual testing
  on this shared dev box; added a bounded settle/retry to the stray census
  (tolerating brief teardown lag) as a defensive hardening, then reconfirmed
  0/0 strays across repeated runs.
- `ruff` flagged one intentional blind `except Exception` in `main()`'s
  per-check dispatch (a probe crash must FAIL that check, not crash the
  whole run) — the identical, pre-existing pattern in
  `agent-bridge-cutover/fixtures/cutover_probe.py`; left as-is, matching
  established precedent. `python -m py_compile` clean; `manifest.json` is
  valid JSON; `scenario.sh` passes `bash -n` and already carries a `.gitattributes`
  `eol=lf` rule for this path (normalized before commit).

**#744 is now fully addressed** (design doc + reusable helper landed earlier
today; the pre-existing multiplexer's last follow-up, #866, landed just
now). What remains under the #736 umbrella is only agent-worktrees'
`_classify_records`/`cmd_status_monitor` wiring documented in the entry
above (tracked, not yet started) — the umbrella issue's own closing
decision (close now vs. keep open pointing at that specific remaining
follow-up) is for the next step of this session.

### 2026-09-12 (final this session) — #744 closed; #736 checklist corrected; #1841/#2301 scoped as the remaining work

Closed out the #744 arc for real (not just in this journal):

- Posted evidence + closed **#866** and **#744** on GitHub (`gh issue close`,
  routed through `agent-worktrees repos gh` for the account-scoped identity
  check — a bare `gh issue close`/`gh issue comment` fails closed with an
  EMU "Unauthorized" error on this repo, confirming the wrapper is load-
  bearing, not optional).
- Discovered the umbrella **#736**'s own body checklist was stale: it still
  showed #738/#742/#743/#744 unchecked even though all four (and #737/#739/
  #740/#741) were already closed — some from before this session even
  started. Verified every one of #736's originally-listed sub-issues
  (#737–#744) is CLOSED via individual `gh issue view --json state` calls
  (not trusted from the checklist text) and edited #736's body to reflect
  reality, adding the three still-open items this effort's own README (not
  the GH issue) already tracked: **#2323**, **#1841**, **#2301**.
- **#736 stays OPEN** — closing it now would violate this repo's own
  completion-gate convention (an effort/umbrella is not Done while any of
  its own tracked Plan items remain open). #2323, #1841, #2301 are the
  actual remaining scope, each independently already filed and named.

### Status of the three remaining tracked items (for the next pickup)

- **#2323** (agent-worktrees resident classify/list accelerator): wire-
  adoption landed (PR #2510); the live `cmd_status_monitor`/
  `_classify_records` wiring is the well-defined remaining step (concrete
  plan in the 2026-09-12 entry above). Not started.
- **#1841** (declare service lifecycle tiers + reconcile user-mode ensure):
  read in full this session. Mostly a **documentation** deliverable —
  add a "declared lifecycle tier" section (default tier, availability
  promises, Windows/POSIX mappings, escalation rationale) to
  `agent-bridge/docs/architecture.md`, `agent-vault/docs/architecture.md`,
  and an equivalent home for agent-dispatch (no `docs/architecture.md`
  exists yet there; `docs/spawn-supervisor.md` documents the *supervisor*
  loop's own persistent-service install, but the *coordinator* (`agent-
  dispatch serve`) daemon's own lifecycle section wasn't yet located this
  session -- confirm where the coordinator's own scheduled-task/systemd-unit
  install is documented, or add a new section, before writing the tier
  declaration) — plus an audit of `install`/`update`/`start`/`stop`/session-
  start readiness against the user-mode-ensure contract (rules 7-9). Also
  noticed `agent-vault/docs/architecture.md`'s own "Supervision and updates"
  section still says "**In progress (#743)**" for the drain-safe cutover
  that this session already **closed** for POSIX — that stale note should
  be corrected in the same pass. Its own "Known linked gaps" (#1836, #1837)
  are both already closed. **Not started** beyond this scoping read.
- **#2301** (audit + close reality gaps against
  `process-count-scales-with-services-not-sessions`): a **live-system**
  audit (real coordinator/`conhost.exe` process-count diagnostics on a
  shared dev box), explicitly higher-risk than #1841 — root-causing
  `agent_dispatch serve` proliferation and windowless-launch gaps needs
  careful, non-destructive investigation of processes this and other
  concurrent sessions may depend on. Deliberately **not started** this
  session; recommend its own dedicated, focused pickup rather than folding
  it into a documentation-audit pass.

### Handoff guidance for the next pickup

Resume via this same effort (`plugin-process-hygiene`, #736). Suggested
order: **#1841 first** (lower-risk, mostly docs + a careful non-mutating
audit), **#2301 second** (live-system diagnostics, budget real time for
careful non-disruptive investigation on shared hosts), **#2323 last** (the
riskiest — live wiring into `agent-worktrees`' widely-depended-on resident
monitor; do it only with a spawned, non-production test monitor exercising
the full round trip, per the plan already on file). #736 closes only once
all three are resolved or each is explicitly re-scoped into its own tracked
successor issue with #736 updated to point at it.

### 2026-09-12 (still later) — #1841: declared lifecycle tiers for agent-bridge/agent-vault/agent-dispatch; found + filed a real POSIX gap (#2524)

Picked up #1841's documentation deliverable. Added a "Declared lifecycle
tier" section (default tier, availability promise, Windows/POSIX mappings,
escalation rationale — the exact fields
`service-lifecycle-supervision.md` requires) to:

- `agent-bridge/docs/architecture.md` — tier 2, confirmed compliant:
  `do_start` prefers systemd/Scheduled Task but falls back to a direct
  daemon launch when unavailable (genuine tier-1 convergence).
- `agent-vault/docs/architecture.md` — tier 2, confirmed compliant per
  #1836 (closed this session). Also **fixed a stale doc note**: the
  "Supervision and updates" section still said drain-safe cutover was "In
  progress (#743)" when this session already **closed** #743 for POSIX;
  rewrote it to describe what's actually shipped (the `set-environment`
  handoff, verified end-to-end against a real WSL KeePass vault) and to
  name the Windows named-pipe DACL gap as the explicit, separately-tracked
  remainder — not vague "in progress" language.
- `agent-dispatch/README.md` — tier 2, **found a real, evidenced gap**: its
  Windows `Invoke-Start` already has a non-elevated direct-launch fallback
  when no Scheduled Task exists (fixed for #3602), and agent-bridge's own
  `do_start` has the equivalent POSIX fallback — but agent-dispatch's own
  POSIX `do_start` does not: it hard-fails ("No service unit installed")
  when the systemd unit is missing, with no direct-launch fallback. Filed
  as **#2524** rather than fixed live, per #1841's own explicit deliverable
  ("file or update focused plugin issues for implementation mismatches
  rather than hiding them in documentation") and this effort's standing
  caution about touching this session's own in-use coordinator without
  dedicated isolated testing.

**#1841's scope not yet fully closed**: the issue also calls for auditing
`install`/`update`/`start`/`stop`/session-start readiness paths against the
user-mode-ensure contract for all three plugins, not just `start`. This
session's audit was a targeted `do_start`/`Invoke-Start` comparison (enough
to find the #2524 gap); a fuller pass across `update`/`stop`/session-start
readiness for all three, plus closing #2524 itself, remains open follow-up
under #1841 (left open, not closed this session).

Remaining under #736: #1841 (partially addressed — docs landed, full
install/update/stop audit + #2524 fix still open), #2301 (not started),
#2323 (not started).

### 2026-09-12 (end of session) — Design breakdown for the three remaining risk-classed items

Before diving in, broke each remaining item down by concrete design/risk
(requested explicitly): see the design decisions folded into each fix's own
entry below and above. Summary of the breakdown that shaped sequencing:

- **#2524** (agent-dispatch POSIX `start` fallback) — smallest, most
  mechanical: reuse an *already-existing, already-tested* Python-level
  autostart primitive (`_ensure_local_coordinator`/`_lazy_start_coordinator`,
  the same one every ordinary CLI command already triggers) rather than
  writing new bash spawn logic. The only real design question was *how* the
  shell installer reaches it without depending on a data command's repo-
  resolution/output shape — resolved by adding a small, explicit, internal
  (`_`-prefixed, help-suppressed) CLI entrypoint, `_ensure-coordinator`,
  rather than shelling out to `list`/`health` (both wrong for different
  reasons: `list` resolves/requires a repo *before* ever reaching the
  autostart call; `health` explicitly passes `ensure=False`). Lowest risk of
  the three: additive-only Python change + a straightforwardly testable
  bash branch.
- **#2323** (agent-worktrees resident classify/list wiring) — highest
  blast radius: touches the live `cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records` in
  agent-worktrees' 25k-line `__main__.py`, which every concurrent session on
  this host (including this one) depends on for basic worktree operations.
  Design already on file (this doc's earlier entries): the daemon's
  `compute` callback resolves a project's own records via
  `tracking.list_records` (never serializing whole records over the wire);
  `_classify_records` tries the daemon via `classify_daemon.classify_via_daemon`
  before falling back to today's unchanged lease-guarded path. The
  **validation bar** before landing: a spawned, non-production test monitor
  (isolated `AGENT_WORKTREES_*` env / tracking dir, never the real resident
  monitor this session's own tooling talks to) must prove the full round
  trip — cold boot, concurrent coalescing, fallback-on-timeout, idle-exit —
  before any change to the production entry points.
- **#2301** (process-count/`conhost.exe` audit) — genuinely open-ended
  live-system diagnostics on a **shared** dev box (other sessions/operators
  may be concurrently using the same coordinators). Design constraint:
  **read-only first** — `agent-dispatch supervise daemon-status`/`health`
  across discovered endpoints, `/proc`-style census (this session's WSL
  target has real `/proc`), before any process is touched. Only act on a
  finding that is unambiguously a bug (e.g. a definitively-stale/dead pid),
  never a live, actively-used process just because its purpose is unclear.

Picked up in that order (smallest/lowest-risk first): #2524 next.

### 2026-09-12 (end of session, later) — Fixed #2524: agent-dispatch POSIX `start` now has a tier-1 direct-start fallback

- **New internal CLI entrypoint** `agent_dispatch._cmd_ensure_coordinator`
  (registered as the hidden subcommand `_ensure-coordinator`, `help=
  argparse.SUPPRESS`): runs `_ensure_local_coordinator` (the existing,
  already-production-tested tier-1 autostart primitive every ordinary client
  command already triggers) and reports success via exit code — deliberately
  NOT reusing a data command like `list` (resolves/requires a repo *before*
  reaching the autostart call, so it's not a general-purpose trigger) or
  `health` (explicitly passes `ensure=False`).
- **`scripts/install.sh`'s `do_start`**: now falls back to a direct start
  (`"$rt_py" -m agent_dispatch _ensure-coordinator`, resolved via a new
  `_resolve_runtime_python` helper that sources the deployed canonical
  `resolve-runtime.sh`) whenever systemd is unavailable, the unit isn't
  installed, or `systemctl start` fails to activate it — mirroring
  agent-bridge's own `do_start` and agent-dispatch's own Windows
  `Invoke-Start`, both of which already had this fallback.
- **Tests**: 3 new tests in `test_lazy_start.py` (the ensure-coordinator
  entrypoint reports success/failure correctly by exit code; the subcommand
  is actually wired into the parser). Full `test_lazy_start.py` +
  `test_cli.py` (156 tests) green.
- **Verified for real against this machine's actual production WSL
  agent-dispatch coordinator** (`~/.agent-dispatch`, real systemd unit
  `agent-dispatch.service`, PID 479, `Main PID` unchanged throughout):
  built a fully isolated `HOME`/install-dir with an isolated `uv`-built venv
  (editable install of this exact source change, since the real installed
  slot's older `agent_procutil` couldn't satisfy the modified source's
  imports) and NO systemd unit registered there; ran the actual
  `install.sh start` and confirmed it printed "No service unit installed --
  falling back to a direct start" then "Coordinator started (direct)", with
  a genuinely new, isolated coordinator process spawned (confirmed via
  `pgrep`) — then cleanly stopped it and confirmed the real production
  coordinator's PID never changed. Did **not** re-test the pre-existing
  "systemd unit present + healthy" branch live, since `systemctl --user` is
  a single **per-UID** manager (not scoped by the shell's `$HOME` override)
  and this box's real `agent-dispatch.service` is that exact unit — that
  code path is unmodified by this change, so it was reasoned about instead
  of re-exercised against production infrastructure.
- `bash -n` clean; `py_compile` clean; `check-version-consistency.py`/
  `check-docs-consistency.py` green; bumped agent-dispatch to `0.1.2-dev86`.

**#2524 closed.**

### 2026-09-12 (end of session, still later) — Found + fixed a consequential follow-on gap in `do_stop`, with a live-production incident and recovery along the way

Fixing #2524's `do_start` surfaced a direct consequence: a coordinator now
startable via the direct fallback (or, pre-existing, via the CLI's own lazy
autostart) is a bare detached process with **no service-manager entry**, so
`install.sh stop`'s `systemctl --user stop` could never reach it — the
daemon would be left running, unmanaged, forever.

- Added `agent_dispatch._cmd_stop_coordinator` (hidden subcommand
  `_stop-coordinator`, same internal-entrypoint convention as
  `_ensure-coordinator`): gracefully stops a local coordinator over its own
  existing HTTP `/shutdown` route (`DispatchClient.shutdown()`) — a no-op
  when nothing is reachable, fail-soft on any client error.
- `install.sh`'s `do_stop` now stops via systemd when the unit is actually
  active, else falls back to `_stop-coordinator`.
- 4 new tests; `test_lazy_start.py`/`test_cli.py`/`test_coordinator_stop.py`
  (166 tests) green.

**Live-production incident during testing (full transparency):** the first
isolated E2E test of the new `do_stop` fallback **stopped this machine's
real production WSL agent-dispatch coordinator** (systemd unit
`agent-dispatch.service`, previously PID 479, `code=killed, signal=TERM`).
Root cause: `do_stop`'s systemd branch checks live status via
`systemctl --user is-active "$SYSTEMD_UNIT"` directly — unlike `do_start`'s
check, this is **not gated on the unit *file* existing under the isolated
test's own `$UNIT_DIR` first**. `systemctl --user` is a single **per-UID**
manager, not namespaced by a shell's `$HOME` override (the same hazard
already reasoned about, and correctly avoided, for #2524's `do_start` test
one entry above — but not re-applied carefully enough to `do_stop`'s
differently-shaped check before the first live run). Since this box's real
`agent-dispatch.service` unit is genuinely active, the isolated test's
`systemctl --user is-active "agent-dispatch"` matched the **real** unit and
the isolated `do_stop` call sent it a real `stop`.

This is a **pre-existing hazard in the unmodified code**, not one this
change introduced — `do_stop`'s systemd-status check had exactly this same
shape before this session touched it. Recorded here anyway because it fired
for real, against production, during this session's own testing.

**Immediate recovery** (before doing anything else): `systemctl --user
start agent-dispatch` — confirmed running again (new PID, healthy) within
under a minute of the incident. Then re-ran the `do_stop` fallback test
properly isolated this time, via a `PATH`-shadowed fake `systemctl` that
always fails (so the test genuinely cannot reach the real per-UID manager
under any code path, not just the ones this session's own reasoning
anticipated) — confirmed the direct-stop fallback works correctly and
leaves zero isolated processes behind, with the real production coordinator
verified unaffected before and after.

**Lesson folded into this effort's own standing testing discipline (not
just this one fix)**: for any future test of `agent-dispatch`
install/start/stop code, shadow `systemctl` in `PATH` (or otherwise prove
no real code path can reach the actual per-UID systemd manager) *before*
the first live run — an isolated `$HOME`/`$INSTALL_DIR` alone is
insufficient whenever the code under test can query `systemctl --user`
directly, because that manager is keyed by UID, not by any env var a test
harness controls.

- `bash -n`/`py_compile` clean; version-consistency/docs-consistency guards
  green; bumped agent-dispatch to `0.1.2-dev87`.

Remaining under #736: #1841's fuller audit (not started),
#2301 (not started), #2323 (not started).

### 2026-09-12 (new session) — Resumed via handoff; completed #1841's fuller audit

Picked up in the recommended order (#1841 first — reading/comparing, no live
process manipulation for the audit itself). Read `docs/install-contract.md`'s
"Hard rules" 7-9 (the "user-mode-ensure contract" the handoff cited) and
`docs/patterns/service-lifecycle-supervision.md`, then compared each of
agent-bridge's, agent-vault's, and agent-dispatch's `install`/`update`/
`start`/`stop`/session-start-readiness paths against them (last session's
audit only covered `do_start`/`Invoke-Start`, which found #2524).

Two real, evidenced mismatches found and filed (not fixed live — both touch
POSIX `systemctl --user` code, which this same session's predecessor already
learned the hard way requires isolated, `systemctl`-shadowed testing before
any live run; filing per #1841's own explicit deliverable):

- **#2554** — every POSIX `do_stop` (agent-bridge, agent-vault,
  agent-dispatch) calls `systemctl --user is-active "$SYSTEMD_UNIT"`
  directly, with **no prior check that the unit file exists** under this
  install's own unit dir — unlike each plugin's own `do_start`, which does
  gate on that file first. `systemctl --user` is a single per-UID manager,
  not namespaced by `$HOME`; this is the *exact* unguarded shape that
  caused this effort's own production incident (agent-dispatch, recorded
  three journal entries above) — and it was **not actually fixed** by that
  incident's own follow-up fix, which added a direct-stop fallback but left
  the root-cause unguarded check in place. Same shape confirmed present,
  previously unaudited, in agent-bridge's and agent-vault's own `do_stop`.
- **#2556** — agent-vault's POSIX `do_start`/`do_stop` still hard-require
  systemd (`command -v systemctl || { _fail; exit 1; }`, no fallback),
  while its own Windows twin `Invoke-Start` already has the direct-launch
  user-mode-ensure fallback (added under #1836, whose comment literally says
  "`start` must not depend on a registered Scheduled Task"). #1836 was
  closed with only the Windows half of its own stated goal realized — the
  POSIX side never got the equivalent of #2524's agent-dispatch fix. In
  practice `agent_vault.cli.ensure_service`/`start_service` (which every
  ordinary `agent-vault` command already relies on) has its own direct-
  `Popen` fallback, so the daemon is not actually unreachable in normal use
  — but `install.sh start`/`stop` themselves have no way to reach it
  without systemd, unlike every sibling installer.

Everything else audited came back clean against rules 7-9: `do_update` in
all three never re-elevates or re-registers (each converges through the
same install/`_install_service`-style path, gracefully skipping systemd
when absent rather than failing); session-start readiness
(`scripts/bootstrap-check.sh`, shared across the `agent-*` family per its
own header comment) never touches `systemctl`/Scheduled Tasks/elevation in
any of the three plugins; Windows `install.ps1` `Invoke-Stop` for
agent-vault already gates on `Get-ScheduledTask` existing (the POSIX-side
analog #2554 asks for); #1837 (agent-dispatch avoiding force-registration
under elevated updates) is already closed and unrelated to this pass's
findings.

**#1841 closed** — its own two deliverables (lifecycle-tier documentation,
landed last session; full install/update/stop/session-start-readiness audit
with focused follow-up issues, done this entry) are both complete, with
#2554 and #2556 now the tracked successors for the concrete mismatches
found.

Remaining under #736: #2301 (not started), #2323 (not started).

Also updated #736's own body (removed #1841 from "still open", narrowed the
stays-open condition to #2323/#2301) and posted a progress comment there
pointing at #2554/#2556.

### 2026-09-12 (new pickup) — Closed #2301: read-only process-count audit found no unambiguous bug

Resumed via a stored context handoff with #1841 already closed; #2323 and
#2301 the only remaining scope. Followed this README's own prior sequencing
note (read-only/lower-risk before the high-blast-radius live wiring) rather
than the handoff summary's numbered order, and picked up #2301 first.

Ran the read-only diagnostics #2301 itself calls for, on this live host
(`owner_user-cloud1`, ~10 concurrent worktree sessions): `agent-dispatch health`
(coordinator `status: ok`, both reconcile loops completing cleanly),
`agent-dispatch supervise daemon-status` (a healthy, empty `default`-scope
coordinator — the live supervised-repo processes on this host run under a
separate `--legacy-env` supervisor tree, which explains the empty
registrations there rather than indicating a leak), and a full
`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` census cross-referenced against each
service's own expected shape:

- **`agent_worktrees status-monitor`**, **`agent_bridge start --passive`**,
  **`agent_vault.service --foreground --persistent`**: exactly **one** live
  instance each (wrapper/venv-python parent-child pairs, not independent
  duplicates) — every singleton-lease guarantee is holding.
- **`agent_dispatch supervise serve --legacy-env`**: one top-level serve
  process with one child per declared `--supervisor-id` (5 distinct declared
  repo/label combinations) — service-scoped, not session-scoped.
- **`agent_dispatch emitter serve <config>.json`**: one process per declared
  emitter config (4 distinct configs) — same shape.
- **`conhost.exe`**: 106 total, only 1 with a dead parent, and that one's
  creation timestamp lines up with this audit's own `Get-CimInstance`
  invocation — almost certainly the query's own transient console, not a
  leak.
- WSL (`Ubuntu` distro) census: 50 total processes, 3 `python`, no anomaly
  (this host's WSL side isn't in active use right now, so it wasn't a useful
  proliferation signal this pass).

No process was touched — the read-only-first design constraint held
throughout, and no finding rose to "unambiguously a bug" (every resident
service is correctly singleton-guarded; remaining pwsh/conhost/copilot counts
are proportional to concurrently-active session shells, which the
process-count-scales-with-services-not-sessions invariant is explicitly not
about). Posted the full evidence as a comment on #2301 and closed it as
**audited, compliant**, via `agent-worktrees repos gh ThomasMichon -- issue
comment`/`issue close` (verified the wrapper-resolved identity via `api user
--jq .login` matched `account-for` first — it had transiently shown a "could
not mint a gh token" ambient-auth fallback warning on an earlier probe in
this same session, which cleared on retry; confirmed correct identity before
posting anything, per this repo's own account-verification convention).

Remaining under #736: **#2323 only** (the resident classify/list accelerator
wiring — still not started, still the highest-blast-radius item; concrete
plan and validation bar unchanged from this README's earlier entries).

### 2026-09-12 (new pickup, second worktree) — #2323: wired the resident classify daemon into `cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records`

Resumed via a stored context handoff with #1841 and #2301 both already
closed (#2301 landed separately, docs-only, via its own PR -- caught and
split out of this worktree after an early commit accidentally bundled this
#2323 code change into that docs-only PR; re-split into this dedicated
worktree before either landed, so each stays independently reviewable).
#2323 is the only remaining item under #736.

Implemented the concrete plan already on file in this README's earlier
entries:

- **Server side** (`cmd_status_monitor`): starts a second, independent
  `classify_daemon.CoalescingServer` (via `classify_daemon.start_server`)
  alongside the existing `HookIpcServer`, publishes its rendezvous fields
  into the same monitor lock file (namespaced `classify_*` keys, never
  colliding with the hook server's `hook_*` keys), and closes it in the same
  `finally` block. A failure to start it is swallowed (`classify_server =
  None`) -- never fatal to the monitor, exactly like the hook server's own
  best-effort start.
- **Compute callback** (`_classify_daemon_compute`, new): resolves the named
  project's own tracking records itself from `payload`'s `project`/
  `status_filter`/`platform_filter`/`all` fields -- **never** trusts records
  serialized by a caller. Mirrors `_list_records_for_args`'s exact filter
  semantics (including the existing-worktree-with-a-`.git`-dir check unless
  `all` is set) so a daemon answer is byte-identical to what the caller
  would have resolved itself. Deliberately uses explicit `project`/`path`
  parameters throughout (`cfg.project_dir(project)`, `cfg.load_config(path=...,
  project=project)`) rather than ever touching `cfg`'s global active-project
  state -- the daemon's `_Handler` is a `ThreadingTCPServer`, so two
  different projects' classify requests can run truly concurrently in
  different threads, and any global-state approach would have raced them.
  Caught by the validation pass below before it became a production bug.
- **Client side** (`_classify_records`): new opt-in `daemon_filters` kwarg
  (default `None` -- every existing caller keeps its exact pre-#2323
  behavior). When given (only `_build_list_json_payload`'s `list --json
  --classify` path opts in, passing the identical filters it used to resolve
  its own `records`), reads the monitor lock, tries
  `classify_daemon.classify_via_daemon`, and on any miss falls through to
  the **unchanged**, factored-out `_classify_records_lease_guarded` (the
  pre-#2323 body, renamed but byte-identical) -- via a serialize/deserialize
  round trip so both paths return through one shape (`_serialize_classify_map`
  / `_deserialize_classify_map`).

**Validation performed** (this effort's own stated bar for touching this
entry point) entirely against isolated, temporary tracking/config
directories -- no test here starts `cmd_status_monitor` or reaches this
host's own real resident monitor:

- A real `classify_daemon.CoalescingServer` running the real
  `_classify_daemon_compute`, reached through a real lock file
  `_classify_records` reads, proving the full wire round trip and that the
  lease-guarded fallback is never invoked when the daemon is reachable.
- The no-daemon-running case (no lock file) degrades to the exact
  lease-guarded answer.
- `daemon_filters=None` (every caller but one) never even attempts to
  resolve a project -- proven by making that resolution call raise if hit.
- The `all`-flag `.git`-existence filter matches `_list_records_for_args`
  exactly.
- Two concurrent compute calls for two *different* projects, run from two
  threads with a barrier, never cross-contaminate each other's resolved
  repo/config -- the check that caught the global-active-project mutation
  risk above during design.

9 new tests (`tests/test_classify_daemon_wiring.py`), plus the existing
`test_classify_daemon.py` (7) and `test_classify_lease.py` (13) suites, all
pass. Full plugin test suite run in parallel; not yet confirmed complete as
of this entry (see next entry for the result before this lands).

Remaining under #736: **#2323 only**, now implemented + isolated-tested;
not yet landed to `main` pending the full-suite confirmation and PR review.

### 2026-09-12/13 (same worktree) — Addressed PR #2574's Copilot review: boot-wait, response validation, monitor-lifecycle test, version bump

The automated review on PR #2574 caught four real gaps in the first cut
above (all four addressed before landing, not deferred):

- **Boot-wait + subscriber lifecycle (medium)**: the first cut's
  `_classify_records` only *dialed* an already-published rendezvous --
  after the resident monitor idle-exits, the very next classify caller
  would see no endpoint and fall straight to the lease path without ever
  trying to boot one, and no request carried a `client_id`, so the
  coalescing server's own ref-counted subscriber tracking never saw these
  callers at all. Added `classify_daemon.classify_with_boot` (a thin
  wrapper over `work_coalescing_singleton.client.call_with_fallback`):
  dials, boots via `_ensure_status_monitor` when nothing answers, polls up
  to `classify_daemon.BOOT_WAIT_S`, and sends the request with a fresh
  per-call `client_id` (`wcs_client.new_client_id()`) so it registers as a
  live (if brief) subscriber. `_classify_records` now calls this instead of
  the simpler `classify_via_daemon` (kept, still used by `test_classify_
  daemon.py`'s own wire-layer tests). Covered by two new tests: a real boot
  invoked and polled to completion when no endpoint is initially published,
  and the existing no-daemon-at-all case (now passing `ensure_monitor=None`
  so the boot-wait poll loop is skipped entirely rather than spinning for
  `BOOT_WAIT_S` in a test).
- **Malformed/incomplete daemon response (medium)**: a successful-but-wrong
  response (a non-dict entry, an unparseable field, or -- the sharper case
  -- a *different* worktree-id set than the caller asked about) was
  previously decoded leniently (skip the bad entry) and returned as a
  partial `state_map`, silently blanking rows instead of falling back.
  `_deserialize_classify_map` gained a `strict=True` mode (raises on the
  first malformed entry) and `_classify_records`'s daemon path now decodes
  strictly, then additionally checks the decoded id set against
  `{rec.worktree_id for rec in records}` -- any mismatch (wrong shape OR
  wrong coverage) re-runs `_classify_records_lease_guarded` directly rather
  than trusting the daemon's answer. Two new tests: a daemon that answers
  with an unrelated id set, and one with a non-dict per-entry value.
- **Monitor-lifecycle test gap (low, nit)**: the first cut's tests only
  exercised the wire layer standalone; nothing proved `cmd_status_monitor`
  itself actually starts the classify server, publishes its fields, or
  closes it. Added `test_classify_daemon_started_published_in_lock_and_
  closed_on_exit` in `test_status_monitor.py`, mirroring the existing
  `test_status_monitor_backs_off_at_iteration_boundary_without_mutating`'s
  isolation technique (an immediate governance backoff that exits the loop
  after one iteration) with a REAL `classify_daemon.CoalescingServer` and a
  spy on `.close()` -- caught a genuine test-authoring bug while writing it
  (the *first* lock write is a bare ownership stamp made before either
  server exists; only the *second* write carries rendezvous fields), fixed
  before the assertion was correct.
- **Version bump (medium)**: bumped `plugins/agent-worktrees/plugin.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, and `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`'s per-plugin entry
  from `1.5.5-dev90` to `1.5.5-dev91`, plus the marketplace catalog's own
  `metadata.version` from `1.7.7-dev83` to `1.7.7-dev84` (agent-worktrees'
  own extra catalog-version rule) -- missed in the first cut; per
  `AGENTS.md`'s Version Bump section, skipping this makes an installed
  machine report "already at latest" and silently ignore the whole change.

Test count corrected: **11 new tests** total (10 in
`test_classify_daemon_wiring.py`, 1 in `test_status_monitor.py`), plus the
existing `test_classify_daemon.py` (7) and `test_classify_lease.py` (13)
suites -- all 114 pass together. Documentation impact: this journal entry
plus `classify_daemon.py`'s own module docstring (updated to say "wired
into `cmd_status_monitor`/`_classify_records`" instead of "deliberately not
wired yet") are the only documentation this change touches; no other
authoritative doc (README, `docs/`) describes the resident monitor's wire
protocol in enough detail to need a matching update.

### 2026-09-13 (same worktree) — Second review round on PR #2574: two more real gaps closed

The fresh Copilot review triggered by the push above confirmed the boot-wait
and malformed-response fixes, then found two further real gaps introduced
by the boot-wait fix itself:

- **Resident-monitor opt-out ignored (medium)**: `AGENT_WORKTREES_STATUS_
  MONITOR=0` is the documented per-session opt-out (each session falls back
  to its own per-session `status-updater`); `cmd_list` already respects it by
  skipping `_ensure_status_monitor()`. The new classify boot-wait path
  unconditionally passed `_ensure_status_monitor` as its boot callback, so a
  classify request with no reachable daemon would boot one **anyway**,
  defeating the opt-out. Fixed by gating: `ensure_monitor=_ensure_status_
  monitor if _status_monitor_enabled() else None` -- `classify_with_boot`'s
  `ensure_monitor=None` path (already exercised by the no-daemon fallback
  test) skips the boot/poll sequence entirely, going straight to the dial
  result. Crucially, the opt-out only suppresses *booting a new one*: a
  monitor that's already live (started before the opt-out was set this
  session) is still dialed and used if reachable -- covered by a new test
  that exercises both halves in one flow.
- **One-shot callers never release their daemon subscription (medium)**:
  `classify_with_boot` attaches a fresh `client_id` to every request (so the
  coalescing server's `touch()` registers it as a live subscriber), but
  never sent the corresponding `release` -- so every one-shot `list --json
  --classify` call would sit in the daemon's subscriber map until the 45s
  TTL reaper dropped it, meaning the configured 10s linger-to-idle-exit
  could never actually begin between callers, and the subscriber map would
  grow unbounded under repeated calls before any single one expired.
  `work_coalescing_singleton.client.call_with_fallback` (the shared,
  byte-identical-across-plugins vendored helper) has no post-request release
  hook to attach a fix to, and modifying that vendored copy would break its
  cross-plugin byte-identity invariant -- so `classify_with_boot` now
  reimplements that same dial/boot/poll algorithm directly in
  `classify_daemon.py` (unchanged in every branch/timing detail) and adds an
  explicit `wcs_client.release(...)` in a `finally` right after the request,
  best-effort per `release`'s own documented contract (a failed release is
  backstopped by the same TTL reaper). Covered by a new test asserting
  `server.subscriber_count() == 0` immediately after a one-shot request
  completes.

Two more new tests (`test_status_monitor_opt_out_skips_booting_but_still_
dials`, `test_one_shot_request_releases_its_subscriber_id`), bringing the
total to **13 new tests** in `test_classify_daemon_wiring.py` (14 including
`test_status_monitor.py`'s monitor-lifecycle test) -- 116 pass together with
the existing 20-test classify/lease suite. Re-ran the scoped
classify/status-monitor/hook-ipc/list suite (279 tests) clean.

### 2026-09-13 — Merged PR #2574, closed #736: effort Done

PR #2574 landed (squash-merged). Before merge, CI's `guards + lint` job
flagged one real, PR-relevant gap the automated code review hadn't (a
different, orthogonal guard): a **required version bump** the earlier
`1.5.5-dev90 -> dev91` bump had already covered for the *first* round of
review fixes, but the *second* round (opt-out gating + subscriber release)
touched plugin content again without a further bump. Bumped again,
`dev91 -> dev92` (catalog `1.7.7-dev84 -> dev85`), confirmed locally with
`tools/check-version-bump.py`, pushed, merged.

The same CI run's `module size` sub-check also failed, listing
`agent-worktrees/__main__.py` (now 29,371 lines, over its recorded
28,951-line grandfathered ceiling) among several **other, unrelated** files
already over their own ceilings on `main` itself (agent-dispatch's
`__main__.py`/`client.py`/`coordinator.py`/`queue.py`,
`picker_tui/engine.py`, `sessions.py`, and the out-of-tree
`worktree-manager` copy of `picker_tui/engine.py`) — confirmed by checking
out `origin/main`'s own tree and running the same tool: `__main__.py`
already sat at 29,162 lines (already over its ceiling) **before** this PR's
+209 lines. This is a pre-existing, repo-wide baseline-drift gap, not
something this PR introduced or is positioned to fix; `guards + lint` is not
a required status check on this repo (`gh api .../branches/main/protection`
returns 404 -- no branch protection configured), so it didn't block the
merge. Noting it here rather than silently ignoring it: a future,
dedicated pass should either shrink these modules or do the "deliberate,
reviewed edit to `tools/module-size-baseline.json`" the tool's own error
message names as the other legitimate option -- out of scope for this
effort.

**Also fixed live, mid-merge**: an unrelated git-hygiene near-miss on this
same pickup -- while investigating whether the module-size failure was
pre-existing, an ill-considered `git checkout origin/main -- .` followed by
`git stash pop` (intending to compare trees) collided with several old,
unrelated stash entries from *other* past worktrees on this machine and
produced a cascade of merge conflicts across many unrelated files. Recovered
cleanly with `git reset --hard HEAD` (the stash entries themselves were
never touched/dropped, still intact in `git stash list` afterward) before
any of it was committed or pushed. No lasting effect, but worth naming: never
`git checkout <other-ref> -- .` against a full-repo working tree merely to
inspect a value that a `git show <ref>:<path>` or a scratch clone would have
answered without mutating the current worktree's tracked files at all.

Closed the umbrella **#736** with a summary comment (all of #737-#744,
#1841, #2301, #2323 done; #2554/#2556 remain as their own independently
tracked, already-filed follow-ups, not additional scope under #736). Moved
this effort from `efforts/active/` to `efforts/2026/09/13
plugin-process-hygiene/` (this repo's archived-effort convention) and set
**Status: Done**.

**plugin-process-hygiene is now complete.**
