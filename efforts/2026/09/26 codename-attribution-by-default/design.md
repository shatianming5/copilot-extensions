# Design - codename-attribution-by-default

Detailed design/decision material for the [codename-attribution-by-default effort](README.md).
Referenced by the Context section and by the Phase 1 checklist items that
implement these decisions (`codename_source`, `wordlist_path_configured`,
`CodenameAttributionPolicyError`, the allocation-time vs. publish-time gates).

### Custom wordlists are a separate, independently-configured risk surface

`codename.wordlist_path` (`wordlist_for_repo`/`CodenameConfig`) lets a repo
supply its own themed vocabulary for generated codenames, entirely
independent of `pr.source_attribution` — a repo might configure a custom
wordlist purely for local ergonomics (memorable names in the Picker UI),
with no intention of ever publishing them. Once `codename` becomes the
*default* `source_attribution` value, a repo that has a custom wordlist
configured but has never touched `source_attribution` would silently start
publishing codenames DRAWN FROM THAT WORDLIST in public PR markers —
defeating the "informationless to an outside reader" property the whole
codename feature exists to provide, if that custom vocabulary happens to
contain identifying or private terms.

**Decision:** a repo with `codename.wordlist_path` configured is excluded
from the new implicit default entirely **for new codename allocations,
scoped to PR-active repos only (round-22 refinement)**. This gate applies
only when `pr.enabled` is `true` for the repo being allocated into —
`codename.wordlist_path` is a purely local, declarative Picker-ergonomics
feature independent of whether the repo ever opens a PR at all, and a
repo with `pr.enabled` false/unset can never publish a marker, so blocking
its ordinary `create` is pure friction with no safety benefit (the
publish-time `codename_source` gate below already makes this safe
regardless, the moment PR mode is later enabled). For a PR-active repo
with a custom wordlist, `pr.source_attribution` must be set explicitly
(`codename`, `true`, or `false`) before a **new** codename may be assigned;
the new default only auto-applies to a PR-active repo with no custom
wordlist configured *at assignment time*, or to any repo with `pr.enabled`
false/unset regardless of wordlist. This config-shape check (does this
repo have a custom wordlist configured *right now*, and is it PR-active?)
governs allocation-time behavior only — it is superseded, for publish-time
attribution decisions on an **already-assigned** codename, by the
per-record `codename_source` check in the decisive fix below (round-14
finding: the two checks answer different questions — "may a new codename
be allocated implicitly?" vs. "is this existing codename safe to publish
implicitly?" — and must not be conflated). This resolves both halves of
the risk for the common case where a repo's wordlist config never changes
after assignment — see the
legacy-record gap and its provenance-tracking fix below for the remaining
case where it does:

- **Future allocations:** a repo with a custom wordlist never silently
  inherits `codename` mode — it must opt in explicitly, at which point the
  operator has necessarily reviewed the vocabulary's public-safety.
- **Pre-existing codenames:** because such a repo never receives the
  implicit default in the first place, an already-assigned codename drawn
  from that repo's custom wordlist never starts publishing merely because
  the global default changed — there is nothing to migrate or suppress
  retroactively, **provided the repo's wordlist config is unchanged since
  assignment.**

**Legacy-record gap (round-8 finding) — the config-shape check alone is
NOT sufficient:** the argument above silently assumes the repo's *current*
wordlist config accurately reflects what generated *every* codename it has
ever assigned. That assumption breaks the moment a repo's
`codename.wordlist_path` config **changes after** a codename was assigned:
a repo that had a custom wordlist configured, assigned a worktree a
codename from it, and *later* removes (or swaps) that config now reads as
"no custom wordlist" — and would incorrectly inherit the new implicit
default and publish that old, possibly-identifying codename, believing it
came from the safe built-in list. `WorktreeRecord` does not currently
persist which wordlist generated its codename, so there is no way to tell
the two cases apart from config state alone.

**Decisive fix:** persist provenance on the record itself, not just in
current config. At codename-assignment time, `WorktreeRecord` gains a
`codename_source` field (`"built-in"` or `"custom"`) recorded once and
never revisited afterward. Publish-time attribution resolution consults
**the record's own stored `codename_source` together with whether
`pr.source_attribution` was EXPLICITLY configured (round-22 refinement)**
for whether a given already-assigned codename is safe to publish under the
implicit default — never the repo's *current* `codename.wordlist_path`
config, which may have drifted since assignment. `attribution ==
"codename"` alone cannot distinguish an explicit opt-in from the bare
implicit default (both produce the identical string), so the gate reads
`PRConfig.source_attribution_configured` too: an EXPLICIT `codename`
opt-in publishes a KNOWN `codename_source` (`"built-in"` OR `"custom"`)
regardless of which of the two it is (the operator has reviewed this
repo's vocabulary) — but NEVER a missing/unrecognized `codename_source`
(round-32 narrowing: explicit opt-in only bypasses the built-in-vs-custom
ALLOCATION distinction, never provenance verification itself; see the
Plan's round-32 finding) — while an IMPLICIT
`codename` default requires `codename_source == "built-in"`. A record
with `codename_source: "custom"` under an implicit default requires an
explicit `pr.source_attribution` opt-in to publish, regardless of what the
repo's config says today; a record with `codename_source: "built-in"` is
safe under the new implicit default unconditionally, **even if the repo's
`codename.wordlist_path` is currently configured** — a built-in-sourced
codename was never drawn from that custom vocabulary, so the repo-level
allocation-time gate above (which governs whether a *new* codename may be
allocated implicitly) has no bearing on whether *this already-assigned*
codename is safe to publish (round-14 finding:
these are deliberately two independent gates, not one rule reapplied
twice — allocation-time gate decides `codename_source` for a new record and
whether the implicit default may assign one at all; publish-time gate
decides only from the resulting stored `codename_source` plus explicitness,
both forever fixed **not** at codename-assignment time but at the owning
`PRRecord`'s own creation time (round-27 refinement): `codename_source` is
per-`WorktreeRecord` and assignment-time-fixed as described above, but the
explicitness input to the publish gate (`source_attribution_configured`)
is per-`PRRecord` and freezes at THAT record's creation, via the same
`attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` mechanism the Plan's freeze
bullet defines — never read live from current config at publish/refresh
time, which would silently reverse an already-open PR's publish
authorization if the repo's config changed mid-PR-life).
New allocations still consult the *current* config to decide
`codename_source` at the moment of assignment (the current-config check
remains correct and sufficient there, since assignment and config-read are
contemporaneous) — this is a targeted addition, not a replacement, of the
config-shape check above.

### Downstream effects to re-examine, not just the default itself

- **`attribution-audit` / `audit_source_attribution_risk`** (Phase 5) was
  built around "the default (`false`) is safe; only `true`-with-a-risky-
  `head_pattern` or an explicit leak is the danger." Its finding text for
  an absent key currently says `"absent (defaults to false)"` — this
  becomes **factually wrong** once the default flips, and must be
  corrected. Re-examine whether the audit's core risk model (branch-name
  leak class, Phase 5) still needs to flag an absent key at all once the
  new default is inherently safe by construction (codename mode can still
  leak via a risky `head_pattern` embedding `{machine}` in the BRANCH
  NAME, which is a separate, still-live risk from the *marker* choice —
  the audit's `head_pattern` check is unaffected by this policy change and
  should keep firing regardless of `source_attribution`'s value).
- **Docs** (`docs/config-reference.md`, `skills/worktree/references/pr-workflow.md`,
  `providers/attribution.py`'s module docstring, `docs/cli-reference.md`)
  all currently describe `false` as "the (safe) default" and `codename`/
  `true` as opt-in — every one of these needs the default's identity
  corrected.
- **Migration guidance**: any repo that explicitly sets `source_attribution: false`
  today (i.e. `copilot-extensions`) is making an **active, intentional**
  choice under the OLD default's framing ("public repos should set this
  false"). After the flip, an explicit `false` is no longer "the safe
  default restated" — it becomes a genuine **opt-out of traceability
  entirely**, which is a different, stronger statement. Each repo's
  explicit `false` (if any remain after rollout) should be re-reviewed for
  whether that's still actually wanted, not just left in place by inertia.


## Per-PR attribution freeze (rounds 26-32)

Full rationale, gap enumeration, fix specification, and regression-test
requirements for freezing each PR's attribution decision (mode AND
explicitness) at `PRRecord`-creation time, strictly validating the
persisted pair, and protecting it under concurrent-save merge. The Plan
checklist in README.md implements these decisions directly; read this
section before touching any of the four `PRRecord` construction/parse
sites, `tracking.py`'s YAML read/write wiring, or `_save_record_unlocked`.

**Freeze each PR's attribution decision (mode AND explicitness) at
  PRRecord-creation time — at EVERY creation site, not just auto-open;
  never re-derive either live on later pushes (round-26 finding, extended
  round-27)** — the vision's `unconfigured-attribution-never-leaks`
  behavior (round-23) promises a config change won't retroactively expose
  or hide a marker already published under a prior policy, but
  `refresh_source_attribution` currently re-reads `prcfg.source_attribution`
  AND `prcfg.source_attribution_configured` LIVE on every later push
  (verified in source: it has no persisted memory of what mode the PR was
  actually opened under, or whether that mode was explicit). Two distinct
  gaps, both must close together:
  1. **Retroactive mode change:** a repo that flips `source_attribution`
     from `false`/`true` to `codename` (or vice versa) partway through an
     already-open PR's life would have `refresh_source_attribution` start
     publishing (or stop publishing, or swap marker shape for) that SAME
     PR on its very next push.
  2. **Retroactive explicitness change (round-27 finding):**
     `attribution_mode` alone is insufficient even once frozen — an
     implicit-`codename` PR opened against a `"custom"`/unknown-provenance
     record is correctly suppressed at open time (round-22 gate), but if
     the repo LATER adds an explicit `source_attribution: codename` key
     (or removes one), a helper that re-reads live
     `source_attribution_configured` would silently flip that SAME PR's
     publish authorization on its next refresh — the identical class of
     retroactive-change bug, one level deeper (explicitness, not mode).
  **Fix:** add BOTH `PRRecord.attribution_mode: str = ""` (the resolved
  effective mode: `"codename"` / `"true"` / `"false"`) AND
  `PRRecord.attribution_explicit: bool = False`
  (`source_attribution_configured`'s value at that same moment), stamped
  TOGETHER, ONCE, by one shared helper — never separately, so they can
  never drift out of sync with each other. **Call this helper at EVERY
  `PRRecord` creation site, not only `_open_via_provider` (round-27
  finding: stamping only there misses every path that constructs a
  `PRRecord` before `_open_via_provider` ever runs)** — verified four
  distinct construction sites: (a) `create_pr`'s own `target_pr =
  PRRecord(...)` (`pr_ops.py:~868`, BEFORE `_open_via_provider` is called
  later in the same flow); (b) `_push_existing_feature`'s fresh-target
  construction for a new push to a terminal/absent PR (`~2090`); (c)
  manual `set-pr`'s bare `pr = PRRecord()` when no active PR exists yet
  (`~1676`) — the round-27 finding's specific example: a manual
  attach-PR flow that never goes through `_open_via_provider` at all,
  which would otherwise leave both fields permanently empty and silently
  fall back to always-live behavior; (d) `tracking.py`'s
  `_parse_pr_mapping` deserialization (`~1393`) must parse both fields
  back from YAML (the round-9 serialization pattern) — this is a READ,
  not a fresh stamp, for a `PRRecord` reloaded from disk. **The WRITE
  side must be specified too, not just the read (round-28 finding)** —
  `tracking.py`'s `_pr_to_yaml_dict` (`~1422`, verified in source: a
  lean, omit-empties dict-builder distinct from `WorktreeRecord`'s
  hand-rolled string-content builder used for `codename_source`) must
  ALSO emit `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` (following the
  exact same `if pr.attribution_head: d["attribution_head"] = ...`
  only-emit-when-set pattern the function already uses for its other
  optional fields, **but keyed on `attribution_mode` being non-empty,
  never on `attribution_explicit`'s own truthy value (round-34
  finding)** — `attribution_explicit=False` is itself a MEANINGFUL,
  legitimately-frozen state (e.g. an implicit `codename` decision that
  was correctly stamped as non-explicit), not the empty/unset sentinel;
  a naive `if pr.attribution_explicit: d["attribution_explicit"] = ...`
  would omit it whenever it's `False`, so a reload sees `attribution_mode`
  present but its partner missing — the strict parser then reads that as
  a PARTIAL pair (the empty-legacy-sentinel case), triggers the one-time
  lazy-backfill freeze again, and reopens the exact retroactive-policy
  bug this freeze exists to close. **Fix:** emit
  `attribution_explicit` whenever `attribution_mode` is non-empty
  (`if pr.attribution_mode: d["attribution_mode"] = ...;
  d["attribution_explicit"] = pr.attribution_explicit`), including when
  `attribution_explicit` is `False`) — parsing alone is not durable: without this write
  side, both fields silently vanish on the very next `tracking.save_record`
  after being stamped, since `_pr_to_yaml_dict` builds the dict every
  `PRRecord` is actually persisted through. `refresh_source_attribution` (and
  `_open_via_provider`'s own initial-publish decision) must use these
  FROZEN `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` pair, never live
  `prcfg.source_attribution`/`source_attribution_configured`, for every
  publish decision on that PR's life — the live config is consulted only
  once, at the PRRecord's creation moment, never again for that PR.
  **The CALLER GATE that decides whether to invoke
  `refresh_source_attribution` at all must not itself branch on live
  config either (round-38 finding)** — verified in source:
  `_finish_auto_open`'s re-run path (`pr_ops.py:1396-1400`) computes
  `want_attribution = (prcfg.source_attribution if attribution is None
  else attribution)` from LIVE config and only calls
  `refresh_source_attribution` `if want_attribution and record is not
  None`. A PR frozen under `attribution_mode="true"` whose repo's live
  `source_attribution` later changes to `false` therefore never even
  reaches `refresh_source_attribution` on this path — `want_attribution`
  is `False`, so the call is skipped entirely, and the frozen-pair logic
  inside the function (which would otherwise correctly keep publishing
  under the ORIGINAL frozen `"true"`) never gets a chance to run. **Fix:**
  drop the `want_attribution` gate on this call site — always invoke
  `refresh_source_attribution` whenever `record is not None`, letting the
  function's OWN frozen-pair logic (not the caller's live-config snapshot)
  decide whether anything changes; this is cheap and side-effect-free
  when there is nothing to do, since `refresh_source_attribution` already
  short-circuits immediately when `target_pr.attribution_head == head_sha`
  (no new push to react to).
  **The stamp must capture the EFFECTIVE attribution, including any
  per-call override, not the raw config value (round-31 finding)** —
  `create_pr` accepts its own `attribution` override parameter
  (`--attribution`/`--no-attribution`) — typed `bool | None` today, but
  widened to `SourceAttribution | None` by this SAME Phase 1's round-18
  fix (so an explicit override can legitimately be `True`/`False`/
  `"codename"`, not just a bool, once that widening lands) — and every
  attribution-consuming call site already computes `want_attribution =
  (prcfg.source_attribution if attribution is None else attribution)`
  (verified in source: `_finish_auto_open`, `create_pr` itself, and
  `_push_existing_feature` each derive this same effective value) BEFORE
  deciding whether to publish — if the freeze stamp instead reads
  `prcfg.source_attribution` directly, a PR opened with an explicit
  `--no-attribution` override (a one-shot operator decision to suppress
  the marker for THIS PR only) would still stamp `attribution_mode` from
  live config as if no override had been given, and a later
  `refresh_source_attribution` would start publishing a marker the
  operator explicitly suppressed at open — the exact retroactive-change
  bug this freeze exists to prevent, now triggered by the freeze's OWN
  construction rather than a later config edit. **Fix:** the shared
  stamping helper must take the caller's already-computed effective
  attribution value (the same `want_attribution` each site derives) as
  its input, not re-derive it from `prcfg` itself; when a per-call
  override was given (`attribution is not None`), stamp `attribution_mode`
  from the override's own resolved value directly (`"true"` / `"false"` /
  `"codename"` — whatever the (post-widening) override itself carries,
  never re-mapped through `prcfg`) and set `attribution_explicit = True`
  unconditionally, since an explicit per-call override is by definition a
  stronger, more explicit signal than any config-level
  `source_attribution_configured` flag it may override. Add regression
  tests: (a) `create_pr` with `attribution=False` against a repo whose
  config would otherwise publish a `"codename"` marker — the stamped
  `PRRecord` records `attribution_mode="false"`/`attribution_explicit=True`,
  and a SUBSEQUENT `push-changes`/`refresh_source_attribution` on that
  same PR (with no further override argument) still suppresses the
  marker, proving the one-shot override is frozen exactly like a
  config-derived decision, not silently reverted on the very next push;
  (b) `create_pr` with an explicit `attribution="codename"` override
  against a repo whose config default is `False`/unconfigured — the
  stamped pair still records `attribution_mode="codename"`/
  `attribution_explicit=True` (proving the override's OWN value is
  stamped verbatim, not coerced to only `True`/`False`).
  **Migration for a PR opened before these fields existed (round-32
  finding: replaces the earlier perpetual-live-config-fallback design,
  which conflicted with the vision's own persistence guarantee)** — an
  empty/unset `attribution_mode` on an in-flight legacy `PRRecord` must
  NOT fall back to live config forever: that would let a repo's later
  `source_attribution` change silently add, remove, or reshape that
  legacy PR's marker on its next refresh — exactly the retroactive
  exposure/suppression the `unconfigured-attribution-never-leaks`
  guarantee forbids, just deferred to the PR's first post-migration
  touch instead of eliminated. **Fix:** the first time
  `refresh_source_attribution` OR `_open_via_provider` encounters a
  `PRRecord` with an empty/unset `attribution_mode` (a legacy PR that
  predates this mechanism), it performs a ONE-TIME lazy-backfill freeze —
  computing the effective mode/explicitness from whatever config is live
  AT THAT SINGLE MOMENT via the same shared stamping helper every other
  creation site uses, persisting it via the same `pr_revision`-guarded
  save path — after which that PR is frozen exactly like every PR opened
  after this mechanism shipped; only the ONE transition (unmigrated →
  frozen) ever consults live config for an existing PR, and it happens at
  most once per PR, not on every touch. **This freeze step must run
  BEFORE `refresh_source_attribution`'s live-config early return, not
  after it (round-37 finding)** — verified in source:
  `refresh_source_attribution` currently opens with
  `if not config.default_repo.pr.source_attribution: return ""`
  (`pr_ops.py:1199`), which exits before ever reaching the freeze logic
  this section specifies. A legacy PR first touched while
  `source_attribution` happens to be `False` would therefore never get
  frozen on that touch — it would just keep hitting the same early
  return, unmigrated, until some LATER touch happens to occur under a
  `codename`/`True` config, at which point THAT touch (not the true first
  touch) would be lazily frozen instead — silently adopting the newer
  policy for a PR whose real first touch occurred under the old one,
  exactly the retroactive exposure this whole mechanism exists to
  prevent. **Corrected order:** the freeze check (stamp
  `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` from whatever is live, if not
  already stamped) must be the FIRST thing `refresh_source_attribution`
  does for a tracked `PRRecord`, unconditionally — including when the
  live config value is `False`, in which case it freezes the pair to the
  false state (so a later config change to `codename` correctly still
  finds the pair already frozen and does not re-derive it) — and only
  after that does the function proceed to its existing
  early-return/publish logic, now driven by the just-frozen (or
  previously-frozen) pair rather than by live config directly. This
  exactly mirrors
  `codename_source`'s own lazy-assignment pattern (round-8/round-13) —
  the one difference is provenance-sensitive `codename_source` refuses to
  auto-promote an unbackfilled record (round-10 finding: the guess is
  unsound), whereas `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` carry no
  such provenance risk (they describe policy intent, not vocabulary
  origin) and are safe to auto-freeze from current config on first touch.
  Add regression tests: (i) open a PR under one `source_attribution`
  value, change the repo's config to a DIFFERENT value, push again — the
  marker published/refreshed on that push still reflects the ORIGINAL
  frozen mode, not the new config; (ii) open a PR under an implicit
  `codename` default against a `"custom"`-sourced record (correctly
  suppressed at open), then add an explicit `source_attribution:
  codename` to the repo's config and push again — the marker STAYS
  suppressed, proving `attribution_explicit` is frozen too, not just
  `attribution_mode`; (iii) attach a PR via manual `set-pr` (never
  touching `_open_via_provider`) and push via `push-changes` —
  `refresh_source_attribution` still uses a properly-stamped frozen
  pair, not a live-config fallback, proving the shared helper is actually
  wired into the manual-attach site; (iv) a legacy `PRRecord` (created
  before these fields existed, `attribution_mode` empty) is lazily
  frozen on its FIRST `refresh_source_attribution` call under one config
  value, then the repo's config changes to a DIFFERENT value before a
  SECOND refresh — the second refresh still uses the value frozen at the
  first touch, not the newly-changed config, proving the lazy backfill
  itself does not reopen the retroactive-change window it was meant to
  close; (v) (round-37 finding) a legacy `PRRecord` is first touched by
  `refresh_source_attribution` while the repo's LIVE `source_attribution`
  is `False` — assert the pair is frozen to the false state on THAT touch
  (not left unmigrated), then change the repo's config to `codename` and
  touch again — the marker STAYS suppressed on the second touch, proving
  the freeze runs before the live-config early return rather than being
  silently skipped until whatever later touch happens to occur under a
  truthy config.
**Strictly validate the persisted `attribution_mode`/
  `attribution_explicit` pair, not just round-trip it (round-30
  finding):** `_parse_pr_mapping` deserializes hand-rolled YAML with no
  schema enforcement — the same class of gap the round-12 fix already
  closed for `codename_source` (treat anything except the one known-safe
  literal as unsafe, never the inverted "anything except the one known-
  unsafe literal" shape). Apply the identical discipline here: (a)
  `attribution_explicit` must be checked with `is True` (or an equivalent
  strict boolean check), never a truthy/falsy coercion — a stored string
  `"false"` is truthy in a loose check and must NOT be treated as
  explicit; (b) `attribution_mode` must be validated against the closed
  set `{"", "false", "true", "codename"}` — any other stored value
  (a typo, a future mode this code doesn't know about, hand-edited YAML)
  must be treated as the safe **empty legacy sentinel** — the same
  not-yet-migrated state as a genuinely absent field, which triggers the
  ONE-TIME lazy-backfill freeze above (round-33 finding: an earlier pass
  described this as falling back to live config "today's existing
  behavior," which read as a PERPETUAL fallback and conflicted with the
  one-time-freeze migration this same section specifies; a malformed
  value must be migrated exactly like a missing one, frozen once at
  first touch, never re-derived on every later refresh) — never silently
  accepted as if it authorized publication; (c) a partial pair
  (`attribution_mode` set but `attribution_explicit` absent, or vice
  versa) must ALSO be treated
  as the empty legacy sentinel — never let a half-written record produce
  a mode without its matching explicitness, or an explicitness without
  its matching mode. Add regression tests for all three: a stored
  `attribution_explicit: "false"` string does not authorize publication;
  an unrecognized `attribution_mode` value is migrated via the same
  one-time lazy-backfill freeze as a missing value, not read as one of
  the three known modes and not perpetually re-derived from live config;
  a record with only one of the two fields set is migrated the same way
  rather than using the one field that IS present.
**Merge the frozen `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit`/`pr_revision`
  fields per-entry across `WorktreeRecord.prs`, not just the single
  `.pr` accessor, under the record lock during concurrent saves, the same
  way round-11 protects `codename`/`codename_source` (round-30 finding,
  corrected round-32)** — `_save_record_unlocked` currently has NO merge
  protection for PR state at all (verified in source: no revision counter
  or merge branch covers it), so a status/finalize writer holding an
  in-memory `WorktreeRecord` snapshot from BEFORE a concurrent
  `create-pr`/`set-pr` stamped the frozen attribution pair onto that
  record's PR state can save over it and silently erase the freeze — the
  next `refresh_source_attribution` then sees the empty legacy state and
  falls back to live config, defeating the entire round-26/27/28
  guarantee. **`record.pr` is only a back-compat property over the real
  `WorktreeRecord.prs` list (round-32 finding, corrects the round-30/31
  text's "merge `record.pr`" framing)** — `.prs` supports serial re-PRs
  and PARALLEL PRs (multiple simultaneously live entries), so a merge
  keyed on the single active-PR accessor cannot protect a frozen pair on
  a non-active entry, or a concurrent stamp landing on a DIFFERENT `prs`
  entry than the one the stale snapshot's `.pr` property currently
  resolves to. **Fix:** merge per-entry across the full `prs` list, keyed
  by a stable per-PR identity. **A dedicated `pr_id` field is the SOLE
  identity, not `branch` (round-36 finding, replaces the round-35 "branch
  is primary" rule)** — `branch` is not immutable either: the identical
  manual `set-pr` correction path that can reassign `number`
  (`pr_ops.py:1693-1695`) can ALSO reassign `branch` (the very next line,
  `if branch is not None: pr.branch = branch`), with no reset tied to that
  mutation. A stale in-memory snapshot captured before a concurrent
  branch correction would then fail to match its own on-disk counterpart
  by branch OR number, reproducing the exact false-non-match/duplicate-
  append failure round-34/35 fixed for `number` alone — round-35's
  "branch is primary" rule assumed an invariant (`branch` never changes
  once pushed) that the code does not actually enforce. **Fix:** add
  `pr_id: str = ""` to `PRRecord` — a random UUID generated exactly ONCE,
  when the entry is first created (`create_pr`'s initial append and
  `_set_pr_locked`'s "new blank `PRRecord`" branch) — and never touched by
  any later mutation (`branch`, `number`, `provider`, `state` corrections
  all leave `pr_id` untouched, unlike the existing `identity_changed`
  reset of `attribution_head`/`head_observed_at` for `number`/`provider`
  changes). Two entries with a NON-EMPTY `pr_id` on BOTH sides are the SAME
  PR iff the values are equal — the canonical, steady-state rule once
  every entry has been migrated. **A `record.prs` (in-memory, possibly
  stale) entry with NO `pr_id` needs an explicit legacy-reconciliation
  step, not a bare "no match" (round-38 finding)** — the inline backfill
  below stamps a fresh `pr_id` onto the ON-DISK (`current.prs`) entry, but
  a caller's in-memory snapshot captured BEFORE that stamp still has NO
  `pr_id` of its own; naively requiring both sides to already share a
  `pr_id` would then never match that snapshot to its own (now-stamped)
  on-disk counterpart, forcing an append — and a second stale save could
  repeat the duplication. **Fix:** for a `record.prs` entry with no
  `pr_id`, reconcile it against `current.prs` using the round-35
  fallback rule (equal NON-EMPTY `branch`, or — only when `branch` is
  empty on both sides — equal `number`) as a ONE-TIME bridging identity;
  if reconciled, treat it as the SAME entry (not an append), and write
  `current`'s already-backfilled `pr_id` back onto the in-memory
  `record.prs` entry too, so that object is no longer legacy if the
  caller saves it again later in the same process. Two entries with NO
  `pr_id` on either side AND no non-empty `branch` AND no `number` on
  either side never match (round-35's original terminal case, preserved
  unchanged: a merge miss here is, at worst, a transient extra list
  entry; a false match would silently overwrite one entry's frozen state
  with an unrelated one's, the more dangerous failure). **Backfill `pr_id` INLINE
  in `_save_record_unlocked`'s existing merge step, not via a separate
  "shipping-time" migration pass (round-37 finding, corrects the
  round-36 text)** — there is no executable hook for that: this repo's
  config-migration framework (`config_migrations.py`) is explicitly
  scoped to the machine-local `config.yaml`/`repos.yaml`/`projects.yaml`
  and deliberately excludes per-worktree tracking YAML, so a "one-time
  pass at shipping time" with no defined entry point would leave every
  existing entry `pr_id`-less indefinitely — reproducing the exact race
  it was meant to close. **Fix:** every single `save_record` call already
  acquires the record lock and runs `_save_record_unlocked` against a
  freshly-loaded `current` (on-disk) copy — add one step there, BEFORE
  the identity-matching/merge logic runs: for each entry in `current.prs`
  lacking a `pr_id`, generate and persist one right then, as part of that
  same locked write. Because this piggybacks on code that already
  executes on every write (not a new hook that must additionally be
  invoked), there is no window where a not-yet-migrated entry can
  outlive the very first save that touches its `WorktreeRecord` — closing
  the race without a separate migration mechanism. Add a
  `pr_revision` counter PER `PRRecord` entry (not one shared worktree-level
  counter — following the existing `profile_assignment_revision`/
  `lifecycle_revision` pattern already in `_save_record_unlocked`, but
  scoped per-entry the way `prs` itself is a list), bumped every time that
  specific entry's `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit` are stamped.
  On save: for each entry in `current.prs` (on-disk), find the matching
  entry in `record.prs` (in-memory) by the corrected identity rule; if no
  match exists (a
  concurrent writer added a PR the stale snapshot never saw), append
  `current`'s entry into `record.prs` unchanged; if a match exists and
  `current`'s entry has a strictly higher `pr_revision`, overwrite that
  matched `record.prs` entry's `attribution_mode`/`attribution_explicit`/
  `pr_revision` from `current`'s copy (never the reverse — a lower or
  equal `current` revision never overwrites an in-memory entry that is
  already at least as fresh). **The counter must be wired into
  `WorktreeRecord`'s hand-written YAML load/save, not held in memory only
  (round-31 finding)** — `WorktreeRecord` is hand-serialized (verified:
  the same reason `codename_source`/`profile_assignment_revision` each
  need their own explicit parse line and emit line, per the
  round-9/round-13 serialization pattern), so a `pr_revision` that exists
  only as a dataclass field with no read/write wiring reloads as `0` in
  every other process — defeating the revision comparison entirely, since
  a freshly-loaded `current` record would never show a revision higher
  than an in-memory stale snapshot. Add: a parse line reading
  `data.get("pr_revision", 0)` (bounded non-negative, following
  `profile_assignment_revision`'s own parsing exactly) alongside each
  `prs:` entry's own deserialization in `_parse_pr_mapping`, and a
  matching emit line in `_pr_to_yaml_dict` (following the
  only-emit-when-set pattern the function already uses for its other
  optional fields). Add regression tests: (i) stamp a PRRecord's frozen
  attribution pair under the lock (bumping that entry's `pr_revision`),
  `save_record`/`load_record` the same file back in a FRESH in-memory
  object (not the same Python object), confirm `pr_revision` survives
  round-trip as a non-zero value on the correct entry, THEN save a stale
  in-memory `WorktreeRecord` snapshot captured BEFORE that stamp — the
  stale save must not erase the freshly-frozen entry; (ii) (round-32
  finding) a `WorktreeRecord` with TWO parallel `prs` entries — stamp the
  frozen pair on entry B (bumping ONLY B's `pr_revision`) while an
  in-memory snapshot holds a stale copy of BOTH entries — the stale save
  must not erase B's freeze even though the snapshot's `.pr` (active-PR)
  accessor currently resolves to entry A, proving the merge operates on
  the full `prs` list keyed by identity, not just the single active-PR
  accessor; (iii) (round-34 finding, matcher rewritten round-38 to use
  `pr_id`) a `create_pr` flow saves a `PRRecord` with `number=None`/a set
  `branch`/an assigned `pr_id`, a concurrent process then observes the
  provider assigning a `number` to that SAME PR and stamps the frozen
  attribution pair (bumping `pr_revision`) onto the now-numbered on-disk
  entry (`pr_id` unchanged), while a stale in-memory snapshot still holds
  the pre-number, `number=None` version of the same entry (same `pr_id`)
  — the stale save must MERGE onto (not duplicate-append) the numbered
  entry, proving the identity rule matches across the `number=None` →
  provider-assigned-`number` transition via the shared `pr_id`, not two
  unrelated identities; (iv) (round-35 finding, matcher rewritten
  round-38 to use `pr_id`) a stale in-memory snapshot holds an entry with
  a `pr_id` set, `number=7`, `branch="feature-x"`; a concurrent manual
  `set-pr` correction changes the ON-DISK entry's `number` to `8` while
  its `branch` stays `"feature-x"` (leaving `pr_id` unchanged), then
  stamps the frozen attribution pair — the stale save must still MERGE
  onto the renumbered entry (matched via `pr_id`), proving a `number`
  correction alone never causes a false non-match; (v) (round-35
  finding) TWO independent, freshly-created blank `PRRecord`s (both
  `number=None`/`branch=""`/no `pr_id` yet assigned, e.g. from two
  separate manual `set-pr` calls that haven't attached anything yet) —
  saving a stale snapshot of one must NOT merge onto the other merely
  because they share the same empty `branch`/absent `number`/absent
  `pr_id`, proving entries with no established identity at all are never
  treated as a match; (vi) (round-36 finding) a stale in-memory snapshot
  holds a post-migration entry with a real `pr_id` set, `number=7`,
  `branch="feature-x"`; a concurrent manual `set-pr` correction changes
  the ON-DISK entry's `branch` to `"feature-y"` AND its `number` to `8`
  (leaving `pr_id` untouched), then stamps the frozen attribution pair —
  the stale save must still MERGE onto the renamed-and-renumbered entry
  (matched via `pr_id`, not `branch`/`number`), proving `pr_id` — not
  `branch` — is the identity that survives a branch rename; (vii)
  (round-38 finding) a stale in-memory `record.prs` entry has NO `pr_id`
  (a legacy snapshot predating this feature) but a set `branch`; a
  concurrent save backfills a fresh `pr_id` onto the corresponding
  ON-DISK `current.prs` entry (same `branch`) and stamps the frozen
  attribution pair — the stale save must reconcile onto that entry via
  the round-35 branch fallback (not append a duplicate), and the
  resulting in-memory `record.prs` entry must come away carrying the
  SAME backfilled `pr_id`, proving a second save from that same
  in-memory object no longer needs the fallback and does not re-append
  either.
