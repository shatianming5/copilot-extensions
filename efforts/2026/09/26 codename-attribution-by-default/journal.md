# Journal - codename-attribution-by-default

Dated, append-only running log of the effort.

Part of the [codename-attribution-by-default effort](README.md).

### 2026-09-20 — Kickoff

- Effort created directly from a live demonstration: checked this repo's
  own recent PRs (#2915, #2922 — the PRs that BUILT the codename feature)
  and found neither carries any attribution marker, because the repo's
  config explicitly opts out (`source_attribution: false`, which was also
  the pre-existing global default). Cross-checked a private, closed-circuit
  downstream repo and confirmed its recent merges all correctly carry the
  full raw marker, proving the mechanism itself works — the gap is purely
  a policy/default problem, not a broken feature.
- Surveyed repos this codename feature already applies to and confirmed
  the pattern generalizes: some rely on the implicit `false` default with
  no attribution at all, while at least one private/closed-circuit repo
  already correctly uses `true`. Repo-specific inventory and rollout order
  are kept in private planning, not this public record (see Context).
- Closed the predecessor effort's umbrella issue (`pr-attribution-codenames`,
  #2838 — Done, all 5 phases merged) and opened this effort's own umbrella
  issue (#2977).
- Handed off for execution: this effort's plan has not yet been reviewed
  (per `planning-efforts`' review gate, submit this README as a PR and let
  the repo's non-blocking automated review clear it before starting Phase 1).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 6 fixes

- Automated review (PR #2978) flagged that `Vision: vision-extending` cited
  nothing. Surveyed `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/README.md` and its
  `pull-requests/README.md` child vision; neither governs the specific
  *default value* of `source_attribution` — they describe the PR/codename
  mechanism's existence and shape, which `pr-attribution-codenames`
  (Done) already reconciled. Reclassified as **below-altitude**: this
  effort changes a configuration default on an already-vision-covered
  capability, not new architecture, so no vision revision is required.
- Also flagged: the custom-wordlist risk (Context, Phase 1) only covers
  *future* codename allocations. Added an explicit migration-gap
  subsection: a `WorktreeRecord` created before this effort ships, under a
  repo with a custom wordlist, may already carry a possibly-identifying
  codename with no provenance flag to detect it — added a matching Phase 1
  checklist item and Validation Plan item requiring an explicit
  migration/suppression decision, not just the forced-wordlist fix for new
  allocations.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 7 fixes

- Round 6's two custom-wordlist findings were both still open after the
  round-6 fix landed. Replaced the hedged "options include X or Y, pick
  one" language with a single decisive rule: a repo with
  `codename.wordlist_path` configured is excluded from the new implicit
  default entirely and must set `source_attribution` explicitly. This one
  config-shape check resolves both the future-allocation risk and the
  pre-existing-codename migration gap at once (a custom-wordlist repo
  never silently inherits the default, so nothing already-assigned starts
  publishing merely because the global default changed) — no separate
  migration/provenance-tracking mechanism is needed after all.
- Fixed an overstated claim: the plan previously implied the wide test
  sweep spans `test_config.py`, `test_pr_ops.py`, and `test_providers.py`
  uniformly. Verified the actual fixtures — `test_pr_ops.py` call sites
  already pass explicit `source_attribution=`/`source_attribution_configured=`
  kwargs (intentional opt-out/explicit-mode cases that must not change);
  only genuinely bare-default assertions (concentrated in `test_config.py`)
  are affected by the dataclass-default flip. Narrowed the plan text and
  added an explicit per-call-site-audit instruction instead of a blanket
  three-file rewrite.
- Resolved a stale "unrelated baseline exceeds module size cap" finding:
  confirmed via `git diff origin/main..HEAD --stat` that this PR's actual
  diff no longer touches `tools/module-size-baseline.json` at all (that
  fix landed separately in PR #2980, merged before this branch's last
  rebase); manually resolved the review thread and posted an explanatory
  comment rather than re-editing unrelated plan content.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 8 fixes

- Round 7's decisive fix ("a repo with a custom wordlist config is
  excluded from the implicit default") was itself flagged as
  insufficient: it silently assumes a repo's *current* wordlist config
  accurately reflects what generated *every* codename it has ever
  assigned. That assumption breaks the moment a repo's
  `codename.wordlist_path` config changes AFTER a codename was assigned
  (added, used, then later removed or swapped) — the repo would then read
  as "no custom wordlist" and incorrectly inherit the new default,
  publishing an old codename that may not actually be drawn from the safe
  built-in list. Round 7's claim that "no provenance-tracking mechanism is
  needed after all" was wrong for this legacy-drift case specifically.
- Fixed with the mechanism round 6 originally floated and round 7
  mistakenly ruled out: added a per-record `codename_source` field on
  `WorktreeRecord`, set once at assignment time from the repo's config AT
  THAT MOMENT, consulted at publish time instead of (not in addition to)
  the repo's current config. This correctly handles both the common case
  (config never changes — current-config and record-provenance agree) and
  the drift case the round-8 finding raised (config changes after
  assignment — the record's own stored provenance still gates
  publication correctly). Added a matching backfill-migration item: a
  record with no `codename_source` (predates this field) must be treated
  as `"custom"` (fail closed) by default, never silently treated as safe.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 9 fixes

- Round 8's `codename_source` fix was itself flagged as underspecified:
  `WorktreeRecord` is manually round-tripped through hand-rolled YAML
  parsing/emission (`tracking.load_record`/`save_record`'s explicit
  per-field content-builder), not a generic dataclass serializer — adding
  the field to the dataclass alone would not persist it across a
  save/load cycle, silently losing provenance on the very next write.
  Checked the actual source and confirmed three distinct codename-
  assignment call sites (normal `create`, a separate paired
  knowledge-repo `create` path, and lazy backfill via `ensure_codename`),
  each of which would need to set the new field independently.
- Added explicit plan items covering: (1) the matching manual
  parse/emit lines in `load_record`/`save_record`, following the exact
  only-emit-when-set pattern the `codename` field itself already uses;
  (2) setting `codename_source` at all three assignment call sites,
  named explicitly so none is missed; (3) a dedicated round-trip test
  (assign → save → load → assert unchanged) plus a per-call-site test,
  rather than relying on the existing provenance tests to catch a
  serialization gap they don't actually exercise.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 10 fixes

- Two new high-severity findings, both concrete real-code gaps in the
  round-8/9 provenance plan:
  1. Checked `_carve_paired_knowledge`'s actual source: it wraps
     `cfg.load_config`/`wordlist_for_repo` in a bare
     `except Exception: knowledge_wordlist = None`, which would silently
     swallow the new fail-closed policy-validation error (for a
     custom-wordlist repo with omitted `source_attribution`) and fall
     back to the built-in wordlist — letting the paired-knowledge path
     allocate exactly the codename the validation error exists to
     block. Added an explicit plan item requiring this path to
     distinguish and PROPAGATE the policy error rather than swallow it,
     plus a regression test.
  2. Round 8's backfill-migration item inferred `codename_source` for
     pre-existing records from the owning repo's CURRENT wordlist
     config — flagged as unsound for the same reason round 8 itself
     exists: a repo's config can drift after a codename was assigned, so
     "current config says no custom wordlist" doesn't prove the record's
     codename actually came from the built-in list. Removed the
     config-inferred backfill entirely; an unbackfilled record now stays
     permanently `"custom"` (fail-closed) unless an operator manually,
     explicitly verifies and edits that specific record — never an
     automated bulk-inference pass.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 11 fixes

- Three new high-severity findings, all concrete real-code gaps in the
  round-8/9/10 provenance plan, each verified against actual source:
  1. `_save_record_unlocked` (`tracking.py`) already merges several
     fields (handoff reservations, lifecycle/session-backend/
     execution-leg state) from the current on-disk record into a stale
     in-memory snapshot before overwriting — specifically to stop a
     stale concurrent writer from erasing a field another writer set
     under the lock — but does not cover `codename`/`codename_source`.
     Added a plan item to extend that same existing merge logic to these
     two fields, plus a concurrent-save regression test.
  2. `wordlist_for_repo` (via `load_wordlist_or_default`) fail-softs to
     `DEFAULT_WORDLIST` for a missing/malformed custom-path file
     (verified in `codename.py`) — so classifying provenance from the
     RESOLVED wordlist (as round-8/9's plan text implied) would
     misclassify a configured-but-broken custom path as `"built-in"`.
     Changed the classification rule to read the raw
     `codename.wordlist_path` config string directly (non-empty →
     `"custom"`) at every assignment site, never the resolved `Wordlist`.
  3. Round 10's paired-knowledge fix only addressed
     `_carve_paired_knowledge`'s own inner `except Exception` — but its
     caller in the `create` path wraps the ENTIRE
     `_carve_paired_knowledge(...)` call in its own outer
     `except Exception as exc: ... pair_stamp = None`, a deliberate
     pre-existing fail-safe for ordinary pairing glitches that would
     still swallow the re-raised policy error at that outer boundary.
     Added a plan item requiring a dedicated exception type
     (`CodenameAttributionPolicyError`) that both the inner AND outer
     handlers must explicitly re-raise rather than catch — only a
     genuine/incidental pairing failure stays non-fatal at either layer.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 12 fixes

- Three more findings against the round-8 through 11 provenance
  mechanism, again each verified against actual source:
  1. Publish-time gating must check `codename_source == "built-in"`, not
     the inverted `!= "custom"` — `tracking.load_record` enforces no
     schema on stored field values, so an unrecognized/malformed stored
     value must fail closed like `"custom"`, never be silently treated as
     safe by an inverted check.
  2. Verified `ensure_codename`'s actual signature and body: it takes
     only a resolved `Wordlist` (not the raw path needed to classify
     provenance), and its concurrent-writer-already-assigned branch
     copies `current.codename` but not `current.codename_source` —
     dropping provenance for the losing side of a race. Added a plan
     item to change the signature to accept an explicit
     `codename_source` and to copy it in that branch too.
  3. Verified the `create` flow's actual ordering: the harness worktree,
     branch, and tracking record are persisted BEFORE
     `_carve_paired_knowledge` runs, so round 10/11's "re-raise the
     policy error" fix would fail the command while leaving that
     already-created harness state behind — not transactional. Added an
     explicit preflight-check requirement: validate the knowledge
     project's policy BEFORE any harness-side side effect, making the
     re-raise path a defense-in-depth backstop rather than the primary
     enforcement point.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 13 fixes

- Two more findings, again each verified against actual source:
  1. Round-11's "read the raw `wordlist_path` string" rule was itself
     unimplementable as written: verified `codename_config.parse_codename`
     silently coerces ANY non-string `wordlist_path` value (a list,
     number, mapping) to the empty string, indistinguishable from "key
     never set" — the same class of gap round 11 found in
     `wordlist_for_repo`, one layer earlier in the parse pipeline. Fixed
     by adding a `wordlist_path_configured` boolean to `CodenameConfig`,
     set whenever the raw key is present regardless of value validity —
     mirroring the existing `source_attribution_configured` pattern for
     the identical "key present vs. absent" distinction on a sibling
     config field.
  2. The preflight fix from round 12 closes the common case but still
     leaves a real TOCTOU window (config changing between preflight and
     the actual carve) that a single early check can't fully close.
     Rather than overclaim full transactionality, narrowed the plan to
     say so explicitly: revalidate the same check a second time
     immediately before the first harness-side side effect (shrinking,
     not eliminating, the window), with the re-raise path as an accepted
     defense-in-depth backstop for the documented residual case.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 14 fixes

- Three findings on the round-13 head, each verified against actual
  source before editing:
  1. **Previously-missed, resolved:** the repo-level "custom wordlist
     configured → `source_attribution` must be explicit" gate (Decision,
     Context) and the round-8/9 per-record `codename_source` gate were
     both stated as unconditional rules, and conflicted for the case of a
     repo that currently has a custom wordlist configured but holds a
     `codename_source: "built-in"` record from before that config
     existed. Resolved by explicitly scoping the two gates to different
     questions: the repo-level check governs only whether a *new*
     codename may be allocated implicitly; the per-record check governs
     only whether an *already-assigned* codename is safe to *publish*
     implicitly, and always wins for that question regardless of the
     repo's current config. Edited both the "Decision" paragraph and the
     "Decisive fix" paragraph in Context to state this explicitly instead
     of leaving it implicit.
  2. Consolidated the round-11 "read the raw path" classification rule
     and the round-13 `wordlist_path_configured` flag into one coherent
     instruction — the round-11 bullet still told implementers to "read
     the raw `codename.wordlist_path` string," which is literally not
     possible from a call site holding only a parsed `CodenameConfig`
     (the very problem round-13 introduced the flag to fix). Rewrote the
     round-11 bullet to state the two failure modes it covers
     (unreadable/malformed custom-path *file*, and a non-string
     `wordlist_path` *value*) and point directly at the
     `wordlist_path_configured` flag as the single classification
     mechanism, removing the contradictory "read it raw" instruction.
  3. The transactionality narrowing from round 12/13 acknowledged the
     residual TOCTOU race exists but never specified what happens if it's
     actually hit — an implementer could reasonably guess anything from
     "silent orphan" to "crash." Specified the concrete behavior: no
     automatic rollback of the harness worktree/branch/record (explicit
     scope exclusion, same rationale as the config-locking exclusion),
     and the surfaced error must name the orphaned worktree path/branch
     for manual cleanup via the existing `git worktree remove` path.
     Added a matching Validation Plan test that simulates the race
     directly (not just the preflight-catches-it case) and asserts the
     message and no-rollback behavior.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 15 fixes

- One finding on the round-14 head, verified against the actual plan
  text: the Phase 1 "implement the custom-wordlist exclusion decision"
  bullet and its matching Validation Plan test were both phrased as "a
  repo with a custom wordlist and omitted `source_attribution` publishes
  nothing," stated without qualification — contradicting the Context
  decision (round-14 fix) that an already-assigned `codename_source:
  "built-in"` record still publishes normally under the implicit default
  even when the repo's current config has a custom wordlist. Split the
  bullet explicitly into two distinct gates: the repo-level check is
  **allocation-time only** (blocks assigning a *new* codename implicitly),
  never a publish-time check; a `codename_source: "built-in"` record's
  publish decision is untouched by it. Reworded the Phase 1 bullet and its
  Validation Plan test to require BOTH a test that the allocation-time
  error fires AND a test that a pre-existing built-in record still
  publishes in that same repo/config combination, so one overbroad
  implementation can't satisfy the requirement by accident.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 16 fixes

- One finding on the round-15 head, verified against the actual
  `pr_ops.py` source: the paired-knowledge fix (round-10/11) and the
  `create` command's preflight (round-12/13/14) only cover the `create`
  command's harness-carve path. `ensure_codename` has a SECOND, entirely
  separate call site — `pr_ops.py`'s `_open_via_provider`, in the
  `codename`-marker branch's lazy-backfill — wrapped in its own bare
  `try: ensure_codename(...); except Exception: pass`, deliberately broad
  so an ordinary backfill failure (e.g. a lock `TimeoutError`) degrades to
  "skip the marker" rather than aborting an otherwise-successful
  `create-pr`. Unaddressed, this same broad handler would also swallow the
  new `CodenameAttributionPolicyError`, letting `create-pr` succeed with
  no marker for exactly the repo/config combination the policy exists to
  block — fail-OPEN instead of fail-closed, and a different bypass route
  than the one the paired-knowledge fix closes. Fixed by requiring this
  handler to catch and re-raise `CodenameAttributionPolicyError`
  specifically, ahead of the generic `except Exception: pass`, while every
  other exception keeps today's skip-the-marker behavior. Added a matching
  Validation Plan test pair: one proving `create-pr` fails closed for the
  policy violation, one proving other exceptions are unaffected.


### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 17 fixes

- One finding on the round-16 head, verified against the actual
  `pr_ops.py` source: the plan's publish-time `codename_source` gate
  (round-8/9/12) and its Validation Plan integration test both only
  addressed `_open_via_provider`'s initial-PR-body marker path.
  `pr_ops.py` has a SECOND, independent marker publisher —
  `refresh_source_attribution`, which republishes the managed attribution
  comment on every later push to an already-open PR — whose `codename`
  branch currently checks only `is_valid_handle(record.codename)`, with no
  `codename_source` check at all. Left as specified, the initial-path fix
  alone would leave a legacy or `"custom"`-sourced record's codename
  publishing anyway on the PR's second and later pushes, defeating the
  fail-closed guarantee this effort exists to add. Fixed by requiring both
  marker-publishing call sites to share one `codename_source == "built-in"`
  helper rather than duplicating (and risking re-drifting) the condition,
  and adding a matching refresh-path Validation Plan test alongside the
  existing initial-path one.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 18 fixes

- Five findings on the round-17 head, each verified against actual
  source/repo convention before editing:
  1. **Typing gap:** `create_pr`, `_finish_auto_open`, and
     `_push_existing_feature` all still annotate their `attribution`
     override parameter `bool | None`, but `create_pr` already threads
     `prcfg.source_attribution` (typed `SourceAttribution`) through all
     three on the unconfigured/default path — now routinely a string.
     Added a Phase 1 item to widen all three to `SourceAttribution |
     None`, matching `PRConfig`'s own field type.
  2. **Live-validation gap:** the "this effort's own landing PR carries
     a marker" live-validation target would silently fail: verified this
     very worktree's `WorktreeRecord` predates `codename_source` and the
     plan's own fail-closed migration rule requires an unbackfilled
     record to suppress implicit publication permanently, so the
     CURRENT worktree can never satisfy this check. Narrowed the
     Validation Plan item to require either a NEW post-Phase-1 worktree
     or an explicit, manually-verified `codename_source: "built-in"`
     edit.
  3. **Malformed Markdown (previously missed):** the round-11
     concurrent-save-merge checklist item had lost its `- [ ] **Merge
     ...` opening line during an earlier edit, leaving an orphaned
     continuation paragraph starting mid-sentence with an unmatched
     closing `**` and no checklist marker. Restored the missing prefix.
  4. **Audit-remedy gap:** `audit_source_attribution_risk`'s `None`-branch
     remedy text tells an absent-key repo to "migrate to ... codename" —
     verified this is now a no-op once codename is the implicit default,
     and gave the `None` branch the same mode-aware remedy the existing
     `"codename"` branch already uses (drop the now-inapplicable clause).
  5. **Structural (previously missed):** the effort README had grown to
     1,137 lines, mixing detailed design rationale and a 12-round journal
     into the coordination document, against `efforts/README.md`'s
     "extract substantial phase designs/inventories into sibling
     documents" convention. Split the Custom-wordlists/Downstream-effects
     design rationale into **design.md** and the round-6 through round-16
     journal history into **journal.md**, leaving this README as a
     navigable summary with links — reduced from 1,137 to 746 lines.


### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 19 fixes

- Two findings on the round-18 head, verified against actual repo
  convention:
  1. The round-18 typing-fix bullet asked for a "type-check assertion,"
     but checked `TESTING.md`: this repo's documented Python validation is
     `ruff check --select F,E9` (pyflakes/syntax only) plus pytest — no
     mypy/pyright gate exists, so that acceptance criterion was
     unverifiable as written. Reworded to name the actual gate (and note
     it does NOT itself catch this class of mismatch) and replaced the
     criterion with a concrete runtime integration test: `create_pr` with
     no explicit override, against a `"codename"`-resolved repo, must
     propagate the string through `_finish_auto_open`/
     `_push_existing_feature` and produce a published marker.
  2. The round-18 journal entry's own finding count was wrong ("Four
     findings" against a five-item list, including the structural
     doc-split finding) — corrected to "Five." Also moved the round-18
     journal entry itself into **journal.md** at this pass (it had been
     left in the README as the "most recent" entry per the established
     one-entry-in-README pattern; this entry now takes that place).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 20 fixes

- One "previously missed" finding on the round-19 head, verified
  against actual source: the Phase 2 bullet asking to "re-examine
  whether an absent-key repo with a safe `head_pattern` should be
  flagged" posed this as an open design question, but
  `providers/attribution.py`'s `audit_source_attribution_risk` already
  returns `[]` immediately whenever `head_pattern_leak_risk` finds no
  risky token, regardless of `source_attribution`'s value — a safe
  `head_pattern` is already never flagged today, for any config. Fixed
  by replacing the open question with a decisive "preserve this
  existing behavior, add a regression test" requirement, removing the
  only remaining undecided item in the Phase 2 checklist.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 21 fixes

- One finding on the round-20 head, verified against actual source —
  and the most consequential gap found so far: the plan's
  allocation-time custom-wordlist gate had only ever been specified for
  `_carve_paired_knowledge` (the paired-knowledge-repo carve). Grepped
  `__main__.py` for every `assign_new_codename` call site and confirmed
  `_create_worktree_core` — the ORDINARY harness-worktree creation path
  every `create` call goes through, not a rare paired-repo feature —
  independently allocates a codename from only a resolved `Wordlist`,
  with no raw-config access and therefore no way to enforce the
  fail-closed policy at all. Left as specified, the plan's own
  flagship regression test (round-15) would have passed while the most
  common real-world path — an ordinary `create` — silently bypassed the
  policy entirely. Fixed by adding an explicit Phase 1 item requiring
  the identical preflight (same exception type, same
  transactionality/TOCTOU treatment already specified for the
  paired-knowledge path) in `_create_worktree_core` itself, plus a
  dedicated Validation Plan test exercising `_create_worktree_core`'s
  own wiring (not just the shared validation helper), so a regression in
  either path is caught independently.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 22 fixes

- Four findings on the round-21 head (three new, one a scope-refinement
  reopen of round-21's own fix) plus two "previously missed" items,
  each verified against actual source/repo convention:
  1. **Scoping (reopened round-21 finding):** the allocation-time
     custom-wordlist gate blocked ordinary `create` even for repos with
     PR mode entirely disabled — verified `PRConfig.enabled: bool =
     False` by default, and that `codename.wordlist_path` is documented
     as purely local/declarative. Since a `pr.enabled: false` repo can
     never publish a marker, the persisted `codename_source` already
     makes publish-time resolution safe regardless — scoped the
     allocation-time gate (across all three call sites: normal
     `create`, paired-knowledge, and the new `create-pr` preflight
     below) to `pr.enabled: true` repos only, with a regression test
     proving ordinary allocation still works for PR-inactive repos.
  2. **Explicit-vs-implicit threading:** the publish-time gate's shared
     helper decided "safe to publish" from `attribution == "codename"`
     alone, but an EXPLICIT opt-in and the bare IMPLICIT default produce
     the identical string at runtime and need opposite `codename_source`
     handling. Threaded `PRConfig.source_attribution_configured` into
     the shared helper so an explicit opt-in publishes any
     `codename_source` while an implicit default still requires
     `"built-in"`; added a parser-level test for the previously-missing
     explicit-`codename` case (distinct from absent-key), which is what
     the fix's own discriminator now depends on.
  3. **Transactionality gap in `create-pr`:** verified `create_pr`
     squashes, force-pushes, and saves the PR tracking record BEFORE
     `_open_via_provider` runs — so round-16's late re-raise there would
     abort with a real public branch and open tracking state already
     left behind, unlike the preflight-based transactionality this plan
     defines everywhere else. Added a `create_pr`-level preflight before
     the squash/push (the ordinary case), keeping the late re-raise only
     as the documented residual-race backstop.
  4. **Vision classification (previously missed):** `below-altitude` was
     inconsistent with Phase 1's actual scope (a new persisted field, a
     new exception type, and multi-site policy gates) per
     `AGENTS.md:139-143`'s "a design change owes both" rule. Reclassified
     to vision-extending (against the existing PR-capability vision) and
     documented that `docs/patterns/README.md`'s binding invariants don't
     apply (this is a data-model/CLI change, not a plugin-service
     topology change).
  5. **Validation gap (previously missed):** the parser test list never
     covered explicit `source_attribution: codename` at all — folded
     into fix #2's new test.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 23 fixes

- One reopened/stale-carryover finding (verified already resolved,
  no action needed), one new finding, and one nit:
  1. Verified the round-22 explicit-vs-implicit `codename_source` gate
     fix is correctly in place in the current head — the carried-over
     thread's anchor commit predates that fix, so treated as a stale
     carryover per the review protocol, not a real re-finding.
  2. **Vision insufficiency:** round-22's `vision-extending`
     reclassification cited
     `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/pull-requests` as already covering
     this capability, but verified that vision doc never actually
     mentions `source_attribution`, markers, or codenames — only the
     generic provider-neutral PR surface. Citing an existing vision as
     sufficient without it actually covering the capability doesn't earn
     `vision-extending`. Revised the vision doc itself (a genuine blind
     spot, not a vision-ahead gap): added a
     `provenance-attribution-without-identifier-leakage` Feature and an
     `unconfigured-attribution-never-leaks` Behavior stating the
     informationless-by-default guarantee and its persistence-across-
     config-change expectation at the intent level (no field names/config
     keys pinned in the should-be body), bumped `Last revised`, and added
     a Provenance entry. Updated the effort's own Vision line to point at
     the now-actually-covering vision instead of merely asserting
     sufficiency.
  3. Fixed a duplicated-phrase typo in `design.md` ("see the assignment —
     see the") left over from an earlier edit's text-splice.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 24 fixes

- One reopened/stale-carryover finding (verified the round-23 vision
  revision is already in place, no action needed) and one new finding:
  the PR's "Documentation impact" statement still claimed "no other
  docs affected," but this PR now also revises
  `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/pull-requests/README.md` (round-23)
  and added the `design.md`/`journal.md` sibling docs (round-18) —
  neither was reflected in the PR description. Edited the PR
  description directly (`pr edit --body-file`) to list the vision
  revision and sibling-doc split under Changes and correct the
  Documentation-impact statement to match the actual final diff.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 25 fixes

- Zero new findings; the one carried-over "Open" item
  (documentation-impact statement) is anchored to commit `f2b538c47`,
  which predates the round-24 PR-description edit that already fixed it
  — verified the current PR description still correctly states the
  vision revision under Documentation impact. Treated as a stale
  carryover (the review tool's diff-based tracking does not appear to
  re-resolve findings anchored to PR-metadata-only edits), not a real
  re-finding, per the review protocol's commit-match check.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 26 fixes

- One new finding plus two "previously missed" items, each verified
  against actual source (the doc-impact-statement carryover confirmed
  already fixed, no action):
  1. **Uncovered allocation paths:** verified `resume` and
     `status --write` both call `ensure_codename` directly for legacy
     pre-Phase-2 records with no codename yet, and neither was protected
     by any of the allocation-time preflights specified so far (those
     only covered `create`/paired-knowledge/`create-pr`). Centralized
     the gate INSIDE `ensure_codename` itself (on the actual-new-
     allocation branch only, never the concurrent-writer-copy branch),
     so every current and future caller is protected by construction.
  2. **Retroactive attribution changes:** verified `refresh_source_attribution`
     re-reads live config on every push, which could silently change an
     already-open PR's attribution mode mid-review if the repo's config
     changes — directly contradicting the `unconfigured-attribution-
     never-leaks` vision behavior this effort itself added in round-23.
     Added `PRRecord.attribution_mode`, frozen at PR-open time and
     consulted (never live config) on every later refresh, with an
     explicit no-regression fallback for a PR already open before this
     field ships.
  3. **Migration policy ambiguity (previously missed):** Phase 3 offered
     "remove or flip to codename" as equivalent choices for this repo's
     own config, but verified they are NOT equivalent under the round-22
     `source_attribution_configured` gate (explicit `codename` would
     authorize even an unverified/unknown legacy `codename_source`).
     Chose removal decisively as this repo's migration and updated the
     config-comment-update requirement to match.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 27 fixes

- Two new findings plus two stale carryovers (verified already fixed,
  no action) on the round-26 head:
  1. **Manual `set-pr` uncovered:** verified round-26's
     `attribution_mode` stamping happened only inside
     `_open_via_provider`, but that's not where a `PRRecord` is actually
     constructed for `create_pr`'s own auto-open flow, and manual
     `set-pr` never calls `_open_via_provider` at all — its own bare
     `PRRecord()` would permanently miss the stamp. Found and fixed a
     malformed-checklist side effect of the round-26 edit too (the
     Phase 1 "Versioning gate" bullet had lost its opening sentence).
     Moved the stamping to a single shared helper called at all four
     `PRRecord` construction/parse sites: `create_pr`'s own
     construction, `_push_existing_feature`'s fresh-target
     construction, `set-pr`'s manual construction, and `_parse_pr`'s
     deserialization (a read, not a stamp).
  2. **Explicitness not frozen alongside mode:** `attribution_mode`
     alone doesn't capture whether that mode was explicit or implicit,
     so a repo adding/removing an explicit `source_attribution: codename`
     key after a PR opened could still retroactively flip that PR's
     publish authorization for a `"custom"`-sourced codename — the same
     retroactive-change bug one level deeper. Added
     `PRRecord.attribution_explicit`, stamped together with
     `attribution_mode` by the same shared helper, and corrected
     `design.md`'s decisive-fix paragraph, which had explicitly (and
     incorrectly) claimed explicitness is "read at publish time" from
     live config.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 28 fixes

- One new finding plus four stale carryovers (verified already fixed):
  round-27's freeze fix specified parsing `attribution_mode`/
  `attribution_explicit` back from YAML (`_parse_pr_mapping`) but never
  specified the WRITE side — verified `tracking.py`'s `_pr_to_yaml_dict`
  is a separate, lean omit-empties dict-builder that would silently drop
  both new fields on the very next save, undoing the freeze one
  `save_record` after it's stamped. Added the explicit requirement to
  emit both fields from `_pr_to_yaml_dict` (matching its existing
  only-emit-when-set pattern) and a round-trip Validation Plan test
  proving both directions actually work together.

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 29 fixes

- One genuine finding, fixed: the Guiding Intent's opening claim ("the
  codename feature works end-to-end, proven live against real merged
  PRs") conflated implementation/test coverage with live proof of the
  codename marker itself — the only live-merged-PR evidence this doc
  cites is the RAW marker form (`source_attribution: true`) on a private
  downstream repo; no repo has ever published a real PR carrying the
  codename-FORM marker, and this effort's own Phase 4 explicitly defers
  that live proof until after this PR lands. Reworded the Guiding Intent
  to state this distinction plainly instead of overclaiming.
- Four stale carryovers (verified already fully resolved in current
  text, each anchored to a commit predating the fix that resolved it —
  freeze-for-manual-`set-pr`, persist-attribution-decisions,
  persist-attribution-fields-in-YAML-round-tripping, and
  freeze-publish-authorization-alongside-mode are all specified in the
  Plan's round-26/27/28 freeze bullet and design.md's round-27
  refinement) and one permanently-stale carryover (the
  documentation-impact statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`,
  unchanged at anchor `f2b538c47` for six rounds straight — the PR
  description remains verifiably correct; not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 30 fixes

- Confirmed: all four round-29 "stale carryover" calls verified
  correct — this round's review lists them under "Resolved since last
  review," proving they were already fixed by rounds 26-28.
- Two new, genuine findings, both closing gaps the round-26/27/28 freeze
  design left open:
  1. **Strict validation for the persisted `attribution_mode`/
     `attribution_explicit` pair:** the round-28 round-trip fix
     specified emitting/parsing both fields but never specified STRICT
     parsing, the same class of gap the round-12 fix already closed for
     `codename_source` — a hand-edited/malformed `attribution_explicit:
     "false"` string would be truthy-coerced, an unrecognized
     `attribution_mode` value could be silently accepted, and a partial
     pair (only one field set) could authorize publication off the one
     field present. Added explicit strict-parsing requirements (closed
     mode set, strict boolean check, partial-pair-falls-back rule) plus
     three regression tests.
  2. **Merge the frozen `pr` field under the record lock during
     concurrent saves:** verified in source that `_save_record_unlocked`
     has NO merge protection for `pr` at all (no revision counter, no
     merge branch) — unlike `codename`/`codename_source` (round-11) and
     `profile_assignment_revision`, which it already protects. A stale
     concurrent `WorktreeRecord` save could silently erase a freshly-
     frozen attribution pair, defeating the entire freeze guarantee one
     layer beneath the round-28 write-side fix. Added a `pr_revision`
     counter following the existing revision-merge pattern, plus a
     stale-writer regression test.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for seven rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 31 fixes

- Confirmed: both round-30 findings (strict-parsing, `pr_revision`
  merge protection) verified correct — this round's review lists them
  under "Resolved since last review."
- Two new genuine findings, one prior "Previously missed" finding
  actually addressed for the first time:
  1. **`pr_revision` needs explicit YAML load/save wiring, not
     in-memory-only (round-31 finding):** `WorktreeRecord` is
     hand-serialized, so a counter with no read/write wiring reloads as
     `0` in every other process, defeating the round-30 merge guard
     entirely. Added an explicit parse line (following
     `profile_assignment_revision`'s own bounded-int parsing) and emit
     line (following its exact only-emit-when-set pattern), plus a
     round-trip regression test using a FRESH object, not a mutated
     reference.
  2. **Freeze must capture the caller's effective per-call attribution
     override, not raw config (round-31 finding, was flagged separately
     as "Previously missed" too):** verified in source that `create_pr`
     accepts its own `attribution: bool | None` override
     (`--attribution`/`--no-attribution`), and every call site already
     computes an effective `want_attribution` before deciding whether to
     publish. If the freeze stamp instead reads `prcfg.source_attribution`
     directly, a `--no-attribution` PR would still stamp from live
     config and a later refresh would start publishing a marker the
     operator explicitly suppressed — the freeze's OWN construction
     recreating the exact retroactive-change bug it exists to prevent.
     Fixed: the shared stamping helper now takes the caller's
     already-computed effective value, with an override always forcing
     `attribution_explicit = True` (a per-call override is a stronger,
     more explicit signal than any config flag). **Self-caught
     correction:** the first draft of this fix wrongly claimed a
     per-call override is "always a bool, never `codename`" — but this
     SAME Phase 1's round-18 fix widens the `attribution` parameter's
     type to `SourceAttribution | None`, so a post-widening override CAN
     legitimately be `"codename"` too; corrected to stamp whatever value
     the override itself carries, verbatim, and added a matching
     regression test.
  3. **Doc-split maintenance (round-31 finding, low severity):** the
     README had grown to 1,252 lines with my own round-31 additions,
     re-triggering the round-18 doc-split concern — the freeze/
     strict-validation/merge-protection bullets (rounds 26-31, ~178
     lines) carried the most self-contained design rationale of
     anything still in the README. Moved that full rationale into
     **[design.md § Per-PR attribution freeze](design.md#per-pr-attribution-freeze-rounds-26-32)**,
     leaving a condensed, still-fully-actionable checklist item in the
     Plan. README dropped from 1,252 to ~1,120 lines.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for eight rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 32 fixes

- Confirmed: both round-31 findings (`pr_revision` YAML wiring, doc
  split) verified correct — this round's review lists them under
  "Resolved since last review."
- Four new, genuine findings, all substantive design corrections to the
  round-26/31 freeze mechanism:
  1. **Explicit opt-in was over-broad (round-32 finding, narrows the
     round-14/22 rule):** the original rule read an explicit
     `source_attribution: codename` opt-in as authorizing publication
     UNCONDITIONALLY regardless of `codename_source` — but that bypassed
     the round-10 backfill's fail-closed guarantee for a record with
     MISSING or unrecognized provenance, which may have been assigned
     under a since-removed custom wordlist the operator never actually
     reviewed. Narrowed: explicit opt-in only bypasses the built-in-vs-
     custom ALLOCATION distinction (publishes a KNOWN `"custom"` record),
     never provenance itself — an unbackfilled/unknown record still
     requires the same manual per-record verification regardless of
     attribution mode.
  2. **`pr_revision` merge must operate on the full `prs` list, not the
     single `.pr` accessor:** verified in source that `.pr` is only a
     back-compat property over `WorktreeRecord.prs` (which supports
     serial and PARALLEL PRs) — a merge keyed on the active-PR accessor
     alone cannot protect a frozen pair on a non-active entry. Corrected
     to a per-entry merge keyed by stable identity (`number` when set,
     else `branch`), with `pr_revision` scoped per-entry rather than one
     shared worktree-level counter.
  3. **Legacy-PR migration conflicted with the vision guarantee it was
     supposed to serve:** the "falls back to live config unchanged"
     framing for a pre-existing `PRRecord` meant a repo's later
     `source_attribution` change could still silently add/remove/reshape
     that PR's marker on its next refresh — exactly the retroactive
     exposure the `unconfigured-attribution-never-leaks` behavior
     forbids, just deferred rather than eliminated. Replaced with a
     ONE-TIME lazy-backfill freeze at the legacy PR's first
     post-migration touch (mirroring `codename_source`'s own
     lazy-assignment pattern), after which it is frozen exactly like
     every PR opened after this mechanism shipped.
  4. **The vision itself needed the same narrowing (mirrored in
     `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/pull-requests/README.md`):** the
     persistence-across-config-change guarantee, as first worded, read
     as an unbounded promise that also covered PRs published before the
     mechanism existed — impossible to keep without perpetually
     re-deriving from live config. Revised to be explicitly
     forward-looking from the point persistence exists, migrated via the
     same one-time freeze-at-first-touch, with a new Provenance entry
     documenting the clarification.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for nine rounds straight — the PR description remains
  accurate even after this round's further vision edit; not re-edited
  again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 33 fixes

- Confirmed: all four round-32 findings (explicit-opt-in narrowing,
  per-entry `prs` merge, legacy freeze-at-first-touch, vision boundary)
  verified correct — this round's review lists them under "Resolved
  since last review."
- Four new genuine findings, all leftover-consistency gaps from round
  32's own edits: the round-32 fix corrected the RULE in one place per
  document but left three OLDER restatements of the SAME superseded
  unconditional rule unedited elsewhere in the same docs, and one
  condensed-summary ambiguity from round 31's own doc-split:
  1. The Plan's round-22 rationale paragraph (README.md) still said an
     explicit opt-in "publish[es] regardless of `codename_source`" — the
     exact unconditional statement round-32 narrowed everywhere else.
     Corrected to state the narrowed rule (known provenance only).
  2. design.md's own "downstream effects" narrative (the sibling
     rationale doc for the SAME allocation-vs-publish distinction) still
     carried the identical unconditional sentence, never updated when
     README's copy was narrowed. Corrected to match.
  3. The condensed Phase-1 checklist bullet (introduced by round 31's
     own doc-split) listed `_parse_pr_mapping` as one of "all four"
     stamping sites — but parsing an EXISTING record must stay strict
     read-only (it deserializes an already-frozen pair, never re-derives
     it); only the THREE fresh-construction sites actually stamp.
     Corrected the condensed bullet to separate the three stamp sites
     from the one read-only parse site explicitly (design.md's own
     detailed text already had this distinction right; only the
     round-31 condensed summary lost it).
  4. design.md's strict-validation section still described a malformed/
     partial persisted pair as "falls back to live config, today's
     existing behavior" — phrasing that reads as a PERPETUAL fallback,
     contradicting the round-32 one-time-freeze migration this same
     section specifies. Reworded: a malformed/partial pair is migrated
     via the identical one-time lazy-backfill freeze as a genuinely
     missing pair, never re-derived from live config on every later
     touch.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for ten rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 34 fixes

- Confirmed: all four round-33 findings (leftover unconditional-opt-in
  restatements, condensed-checklist ambiguity) verified correct — this
  round's review lists them under "Resolved since last review."
- Three new genuine findings, all real correctness gaps in the round-32
  fixes:
  1. **`attribution_explicit` emission was keyed on the wrong condition:**
     the round-28 emit spec used an omit-when-falsy pattern, but
     `attribution_explicit=False` is itself a legitimately-frozen state
     (e.g. an implicit `codename` decision) — omitting it would strand
     `attribution_mode` without its partner on reload, silently
     re-triggering the lazy-backfill freeze. Corrected: emit
     `attribution_explicit` whenever `attribution_mode` is non-empty,
     regardless of its own True/False value.
  2. **PR identity matching didn't account for the `number=None` →
     provider-assigned-`number` transition:** `create_pr` saves a
     `PRRecord` before the provider assigns its `number`; the round-32
     "number when set, else branch" rule would key a stale pre-number
     snapshot and its now-numbered on-disk counterpart by DIFFERENT
     fields, appending a duplicate instead of merging. Corrected: two
     entries match when both have equal numbers, OR either side lacks a
     number and their branches are equal.
  3. **The provenance fail-closed rule was scoped too broadly:** round-32
     said an unbackfilled/unknown-provenance record "never auto-publishes
     under any attribution mode" — but `source_attribution: True`'s
     independent raw-marker path never depended on `codename_source` and
     must not start now. Scoped the rule explicitly to codename markers
     only, added a regression test proving raw-marker publication is
     unaffected.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for eleven rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 35 fixes

- Confirmed: all three round-34 findings (emit condition, identity
  transition, provenance scope) verified correct — this round's review
  lists them under "Resolved since last review."
- Two new genuine findings, both further correctness gaps in the
  round-34 identity-matching fix:
  1. **Empty branches could falsely collide:** round-34's "either side
     lacks a number → match by branch" rule didn't require the branch to
     be non-empty — two independent, freshly-created blank `PRRecord`s
     (e.g. from separate manual `set-pr` calls) both have `branch=""`,
     which would match under the naive rule and silently merge one
     blank record's state onto an unrelated one's. Fixed: branch
     equality only establishes identity when the branch is NON-EMPTY;
     entries with no real identity on either side never match.
  2. **PR numbers aren't immutable:** round-34's "number when both set,
     else branch" rule required equal numbers whenever both entries had
     one — but a manual `set-pr` correction can reassign a number while
     the branch stays fixed, so a stale snapshot (`number=7`) would fail
     to match its own renumbered on-disk counterpart (`number=8`, same
     branch) and wrongly append a duplicate. Corrected: `branch` (when
     non-empty) is now the PRIMARY identity in all cases; `number` is
     only a fallback when `branch` is empty on both sides.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for twelve rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 36 fixes

- One new genuine finding: **`branch` isn't immutable either.**
  Round-35's "branch is the primary identity" rule assumed a pushed
  feature branch name never changes once set, but the same manual
  `set-pr` correction path that can reassign `number` (`pr_ops.py`'s
  `_set_pr_locked`) can ALSO reassign `branch`, with no identity-preserving
  reset tied to either mutation. A stale snapshot captured before a
  concurrent branch correction would then fail to match its own on-disk
  counterpart by branch OR number, reproducing the exact
  false-non-match/duplicate-append failure round-34/35 fixed for `number`
  alone. Fixed: added a dedicated `pr_id` field — a random UUID assigned
  ONCE at entry creation and never mutated by any later `branch`/
  `number`/`provider`/`state` correction — as the SOLE per-entry identity,
  superseding `branch` entirely. Every existing `PRRecord` gets `pr_id`
  backfilled in a single one-time migration pass at shipping time (not
  lazily at next touch), closing the window where a not-yet-migrated
  entry could still race a `set-pr` correction with no stable identity on
  either side.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for thirteen rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 37 fixes

- Confirmed: round-36's `pr_id` identity fix verified correct — this
  round's review lists it under "Resolved since last review."
- Two new genuine findings, both exposing that round-36's design
  described mechanisms with no actual place to run:
  1. **No executable hook for the `pr_id` backfill:** round-36 called for
     a "one-time migration pass at shipping time," but this repo's
     config-migration framework (`config_migrations.py`) is scoped to
     machine-local config and explicitly excludes tracking YAML — the
     described pass had no entry point that would ever invoke it. Fixed:
     backfill `pr_id` INLINE inside `_save_record_unlocked`'s existing
     merge step, which already runs under the record lock on every
     single `save_record` call — no separate migration mechanism needed.
  2. **The legacy-freeze-on-first-touch design (round-32) can't fire
     for a repo whose live `source_attribution` starts `False`:**
     `refresh_source_attribution` returns immediately
     (`if not config.default_repo.pr.source_attribution: return ""`,
     `pr_ops.py:1199`) before ever reaching the freeze logic. A legacy
     PR first touched under a false config would stay unmigrated
     indefinitely; if the config later changes to `codename`, that LATER
     touch (not the true first one) would be lazily frozen instead,
     silently adopting the newer policy. Fixed: the freeze check must
     run BEFORE the live-config early return, unconditionally — freezing
     to the false state when that's what's live, so a later config
     change correctly finds the pair already frozen.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for fourteen rounds straight — not re-edited again).

### 2026-09-20 — Plan-review round 38 fixes

- Confirmed: both round-37 findings (inline `pr_id` backfill, freeze-
  before-guard ordering) verified correct — this round's review lists
  them under "Resolved since last review."
- Two new genuine findings, plus two "previously missed" findings in
  unchanged code the reviewer newly surfaced:
  1. **Inline `pr_id` backfill can still duplicate a legacy entry:**
     backfilling `current.prs` (on-disk) with a fresh `pr_id` doesn't
     help a stale in-memory `record.prs` snapshot that has NO `pr_id` of
     its own — requiring both sides to already share one forces an
     append instead of a match, and a second stale save could repeat the
     duplication. Fixed: added an explicit legacy-reconciliation step —
     a `pr_id`-less in-memory entry falls back to the round-35
     branch/number rule to find its on-disk counterpart, and the
     resolved `pr_id` is written back onto the in-memory entry too, so a
     later save from the same object no longer needs the fallback.
  2. **The frozen-attribution CALLER GATE also branches on live config:**
     `_finish_auto_open`'s re-run path only calls
     `refresh_source_attribution` `if want_attribution` (live), so a PR
     frozen under `"true"` whose config later flips to `false` never
     even reaches the frozen-pair logic round-37 fixed inside the
     function. Fixed: drop the gate — always invoke
     `refresh_source_attribution` when a record exists; the function's
     own frozen-pair check (not the caller's live snapshot) decides.
  3. Rewrote the acceptance-test items that still required matching via
     `branch`/`number` (a contradiction with `pr_id` being the sole
     identity per round-36/37) to exercise `pr_id` instead, and added a
     dedicated legacy-reconciliation regression test.
- One permanently-stale carryover persists (the documentation-impact
  statement finding, `#discussion_r4057190221`, unchanged at anchor
  `f2b538c47` for fifteen rounds straight — not re-edited again).
