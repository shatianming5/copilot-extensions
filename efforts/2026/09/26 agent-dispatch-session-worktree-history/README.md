## Guiding Intent

Any consumer that needs to show or link to "the session working this
worktree/task" — Neuron Forge, the Worktree Manager, Intelligence Dampener, a
future Adjudication Board tenant, an operator reading agent-dispatch's own
history — resolves it through **one shared, origin-agnostic primitive**,
never a bespoke per-consumer convention. And that primitive answers honestly
across a task's **entire lifetime**, not just its current moment: every
session and worktree that has ever attached to a task remains durably
queryable, even after a release, a resume, or a fresh re-embodiment moves
the task on to a new owner.

## Participants

Single-machine effort for its initial design/schema phases (agent-dispatch's
task store is local, single-writer); later phases touch agent-bridge's
resolver, which already has cross-machine reach via the existing peer-bridge
mesh — no new coordination topology needed.

## Context

Surfaced from `private-downstream-repo` (the facility's private consumer monorepo)
during a session investigating a stuck Intelligence Dampener PR review. Two
distinct but related gaps were found:

1. **No durable attachment history.** Diagnosing/fixing the stuck review
   required releasing its agent-dispatch task twice for a fresh embodiment.
   Each release **discarded** the prior session's identity — `owner_session_id`
   is a single mutable column
   (`plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/queue.py`'s `bind_owner_session`
   does a plain `UPDATE tasks SET owner_session_id=?`). There is no way to
   later ask "what sessions has this task ever had, and when did each start
   and end" — useful for audit, debugging a flaky worker, or building a
   durable link to a *specific* past attempt rather than only "whoever has it
   now."
2. **No shared, origin-agnostic resolver.** A first attempt to fix
   Intelligence Dampener's own "View reviewer" link
   (the downstream PR, since reverted) hardcoded Dampener's own
   `dampener-pr<N>` worktree-naming convention directly into the link
   builder — solving Dampener's problem while leaving every *other* consumer
   (an Adjudication Board run, Permanent Record's journal, a plain
   agent-dispatch CLI user) to invent its own equivalent trick. agent-bridge
   already has almost everything needed
   (`any-session-any-registered-worktree-regardless-of-liveness`: resolve a
   session by ID for *any* registered worktree, live or archived, via its
   cold-store-provider mechanism) — the missing piece is resolving *starting
   from an origin's own durable handle* (a dispatch task reference) rather
   than requiring the caller to already have derived a worktree/session ID
   through its own logic.

Prior art this effort extends rather than replaces (see each vision's own
Concepts & Components):
- agent-bridge's cold-store-provider mechanism (`docs/architecture.md`'s
  provider-registration section) — the live-or-archived session-serving half.
- agent-dispatch's `bind_owner_session` / `_audit` trail
  (`queue.py`) — the existing (single-slot) ownership bookkeeping this effort
  extends to a full history, and the existing state-transition audit log that
  may already carry enough raw material to backfill from.
- `private-downstream-repo`'s `session-worktree-archive-linkout` effort — the consumer
  -side effort whose Phase 4 (Dampener's "View reviewer" link) is blocked on
  this landing; see its 2026-09-19 course-correction journal entry for the
  reverted bespoke attempt.

## Request

> Also, I don't want anything bespoke to ID here. Whatever strategy should
> work for any worktree+session combo, whether created in Neuron Forge, the
> Worktree Manager, or agent-dispatch. We also need to add robustness for
> getting the session id out of agent-bridge and durably binding it to
> agent-dispatch tasks. A task should have a history of attached agent
> worktrees and sessions.

(verbatim, from the private-downstream-repo session that surfaced this; "ID" =
Intelligence Dampener)

## Plan

### Phase 1 — agent-dispatch: durable attachment history (the data source)
- [x] Design the history record shape: `(task_id, session_id, worktree_id,
      machine, attached_at, detached_at, detach_reason)`. Detach reasons
      cover at least: `completed`, `suspended`, `released`, `superseded`
      (context-exhaustion handoff to a successor session per
      *suspend-idle-resume-same-session*). **Confirmed delivered as
      designed:** the shipped `task_attachments` table
      (`plugins/agent-dispatch/src/agent_dispatch/queue.py`) carries this
      exact designed field set, plus its own internal
      `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` row identifier (an
      implementation detail outside the designed shape, not a deviation
      from it).
- [x] Add an append-only `task_attachments` table (or equivalent), written
      by the existing lifecycle transition points that already touch
      `owner_session_id`/`target_worktree` (`bind_owner_session`, `suspend`,
      `resume`, `release`, `reattach`) — every write to the mutable
      current-owner fields gets a paired history append, never a
      current-owner mutation without one. **Delivered:** `task_attachments`
      table + `TaskQueue._record_attachment` (a single choke point hooked
      into both `bind_owner_session` and the generic `_transition`, so
      every current call site that ever sets `owner_session_id` — release,
      yield, reset-to-proposed, a handoff-adopting `resume` — is covered
      without per-call-site duplication). A same-session suspend/resume is
      correctly a no-op (compares old vs. new session id before writing).
- [x] New read API: `GET /tasks/{id}/attachments` (or CLI
      `agent-dispatch show <id> --history`) returning the full ledger,
      newest-first. **Delivered:** both — the REST route, a
      `DispatchClient.attachments()` method, and `show --history`.
- [x] Backfill consideration: audit-log entries already carry
      "owner session bound (...)" notes for some transitions — evaluate
      whether a one-time backfill can reconstruct partial history for
      already-existing tasks, or whether it's acceptable for history to
      start from this effort's landing forward only (flag-don't-guess, per
      the facility's own reconstruction-honesty convention — no fabricated
      timestamps for genuinely unknown transitions). **Decided: no
      backfill** — history starts from this landing forward; no fabricated
      timestamps for genuinely unknown pre-landing transitions. A closed
      decision, not deferred future work.
- [x] Tests: every lifecycle transition that changes the current owner
      correctly appends to history; a chain of release→claim→release→claim
      preserves every prior session's record; concurrent-writer safety
      (the existing `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction pattern already used by
      `bind_owner_session` extends naturally to the paired write).
      **Delivered:** a queue-level test walking bind→suspend/resume(same
      session, no-op)→suspend→release→re-bind(session-b)→handoff(session-c),
      plus HTTP-level coordinator tests for the new route. Concurrent-writer
      safety is inherited for free — the write happens inside the SAME
      `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction as the existing owner-session mutation,
      not a separate one.

### Phase 2 — agent-bridge: resolve by dispatch-task reference — **Done**
> **2026-09-19 progress note (fully landed):** `GET
> /api/v1/dispatch-tasks/{id}/session` now exists
> (`plugins/agent-bridge/src/agent_bridge/routes/dispatch_tasks.py`), backed
> by a new `agent_dispatch_client` HTTP client and an
> `agent_dispatch_url`/`agent_dispatch_token` config surface on
> `ServiceConfig` (env-overridable via `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL`/
> `AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, mirroring `neuron-forge`'s own shape). Landed
> across three sequential PRs (#2954 route wiring, #2955 HTTP protocol
> version bump, #2956 contract-evidence attestation) — split because the
> contract registry's provenance model pins evidence to real, already-merged
> commit hashes, which an in-flight PR's own commit reference cannot
> satisfy under this repo's rebase-then-squash policy. `HTTP_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
> is now 15 (`DISPATCH_TASK_SESSION_PROTOCOL_VERSION`), fully attested.
- [x] Extend the existing session/worktree resolver
      (`any-session-any-registered-worktree-regardless-of-liveness`'s
      implementation) to accept a dispatch-task reference as an additional
      resolution key, not only a session ID or worktree ID directly.
      Resolution derives the worktree from the task (the delegation layer
      already exposes this — e.g. `target_worktree`/payload fields consumers
      like `neuron-forge`'s `task_worktree()` already read), then applies the
      existing any-session-any-worktree resolution to that worktree.
      **Delivered (ranking half):** `dispatch_task_resolution.
      candidate_session_ids()` / `task_worktree_id()` — pure functions
      given a task JSON + its attachment history, testable with no HTTP or
      SessionManager dependency.
- [x] When the task's *current* owner has nothing live, consult Phase 1's
      attachment history (not just the cold-store providers) before giving
      up — a task's most recent **detached** session may still be
      individually resolvable even if the worktree itself is gone, if a
      cold-store provider still has that exact session. **Delivered:**
      `candidate_session_ids()` orders the current owner session first,
      then every attachment history entry newest-first, deduped.
- [x] New/extended REST surface mirroring the existing worktree-scoped
      routes' shape (so consumers' interface doesn't change shape, only
      gains a new valid key) — exact route design TBD at implementation
      time; keep consistent with `docs/architecture.md`'s existing
      provider-registration and resolver documentation. **Delivered:**
      `GET /api/v1/dispatch-tasks/{id}/session` fetches the task +
      attachments from agent-dispatch (new `agent_dispatch_url`/
      `agent_dispatch_token` config surface, mirroring `neuron-forge`'s own
      established pattern for the same optional dependency) and loops
      `candidate_session_ids()` through `SessionManager.get_session()` /
      `fetch_cold_store_session()`, falling back to
      `task_worktree_id()` + `routes.worktrees._latest_session_for_worktree()`
      when no candidate resolves.
- [x] Tests: resolving a live dispatch task, a suspended one, a fully
      terminal/released one whose worktree is gone but whose last session
      is still cold-store-resolvable, and one with no resolvable session at
      all (graceful 404, never an error). **Delivered:** unit tests for the
      ranking module (current-owner-first, dedup, empty/malformed input)
      plus `tests/test_dispatch_task_session_route.py` integration tests
      covering current-owner-live, attachment-history cold-store fallback,
      worktree-latest-session fallback, no-resolvable-session 404,
      unknown-task 404, and unconfigured-coordinator 503.

### Phase 3 — consumers: adopt the shared resolver
- [x] `private-downstream-repo` Intelligence Dampener: re-attempt the "View reviewer"
      link (`session-worktree-archive-linkout` Phase 4, previously reverted
      as PR #7200) using the new dispatch-task-reference resolution instead
      of the `dampener-pr<N>` naming convention. **Delivered and merged
      downstream:** the consumer's "View reviewer" link now resolves via
      this effort's Phase 2 route instead of a bespoke worktree-naming
      convention.
- [x] Neuron Forge's own `/dispatch/:taskId` "exact live session" viewer
      (`worktree_tasks.py`): evaluate whether it should be retired in favor
      of always routing through the general resolver, or kept as a distinct
      "insist on live, nothing else" affordance for a narrower use case.
      Decide, don't guess — this route is used by more than just Dampener's
      link (any dispatched-task viewer), so retiring it needs its own
      callers audited first. **Decided: extend, don't retire.** Audited its
      callers first — the consuming Dampener UI's queue and verdicts panels
      are its only current callers, no other consumer exists yet. The
      viewer's resolver now falls back from the exact-live check to the
      new `GET /api/dispatch-tasks/{id}/session` route (this effort's
      Phase 2) before giving up, keeping one stable URL for both the
      in-flight and already-reclaimed-worktree cases instead of inventing a
      second route. **Delivered and merged downstream.**
- [x] Document the shared resolution primitive in each vision's Concepts &
      Components (not just Features) so a future consumer finds it before
      inventing its own convention. **Delivered:** `visions/plugins/
      agent-bridge`'s *topology and resolver layer* concept now points to
      the concrete `GET /api/v1/dispatch-tasks/{id}/session` route;
      `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch`'s *task* concept now points to the
      attachment-history query surface.

## Validation Plan

- [x] Phase 1: a synthetic multi-release/resume/reattach sequence on one
      task produces a complete, correctly-ordered attachment history with no
      gaps or duplicate records. Proven by
      `test_attachment_history_records_bind_release_and_handoff`
      (`plugins/agent-dispatch/tests/test_queue.py`) — bind→same-session
      suspend/resume (no-op)→suspend→release→re-claim(session-b)→handoff
      (session-c), asserting no record is discarded and ordering stays
      newest-first at every step.
- [x] Phase 2: resolving the same task by its dispatch-task reference and by
      its worktree ID directly produce identical results when both are
      available; resolving after the task's worktree is reclaimed still
      answers for its last cold-store-resolvable session. Validated by
      `tests/test_dispatch_task_session_route.py` (current-owner live,
      attachment-history cold-store fallback for a released task, and
      worktree-latest-session fallback).
- [x] Phase 3: Dampener's "View reviewer" link, re-implemented, resolves for
      an in-flight review, a just-completed one, and one whose review
      worktree has since been reclaimed — with zero Dampener-specific
      resolution logic in the link builder itself. **Delivered and merged
      downstream:** the consumer's full test suite passes (535/535,
      including 7 new for the durable route/proxy) and both touched
      packages' typecheck/lint are clean.

## Proposal

_Pending — Phase 1's schema/API design is the first concrete artifact._

## Journal

### 2026-09-26 — Archive-sweep audit: resolved the Backfill decision, archived
Found via a repo-wide "Done; pending archive" sweep: the Backfill bullet was
left unchecked despite already carrying a final, closed decision ("no
backfill; history starts from landing forward") -- corrected to `[x]` (a
resolved decision, not deferred future work). No remaining unchecked items.
Archived.

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 2 ranking logic landed
- `agent_bridge.dispatch_task_resolution`: pure `candidate_session_ids()` /
  `task_worktree_id()` — given a task JSON + attachment history JSON (Phase
  1's `GET /tasks/{id}/attachments` shape), rank which session IDs to try,
  current owner first then history newest-first, deduped. No HTTP client or
  SessionManager dependency, so fully unit-tested (6 tests) without mocking
  agent-dispatch.
- Deliberately did NOT wire the live HTTP route this session — that needs a
  new `AGENT_DISPATCH_URL`/`AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` config surface on
  agent-bridge (mirroring `neuron-forge`'s own established pattern for the
  same dependency), which is a real design decision worth its own reviewed
  slice rather than rushing into a shared repo's live app under time
  pressure. Documented as the concrete next step in Phase 2's checklist.
- Full `agent-bridge` suite: 343 passed, 10 skipped, no regressions.

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 1 landed
- `task_attachments` table + `TaskQueue._record_attachment`/`attachment_history`,
  hooked into `bind_owner_session` and the generic `_transition` (single
  choke point covering every current owner-session-clearing call site:
  `release_suspended`, `yield`, reset-to-proposed, a handoff-adopting
  `resume`). `GET /tasks/{id}/attachments` route, `DispatchClient.
  attachments()`, and `agent-dispatch show <id> --history`.
- Full plugin suite: 667 tests, 666 passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure
  (`test_requeued_task_is_not_double_spawned`, confirmed identical with and
  without this change via `git stash`). `ruff` error count (32) also
  unchanged before/after.
- Backfill (partial history reconstruction from existing `task_events` audit
  notes) deferred — history starts from this landing forward.

### 2026-09-19 — Kickoff
- Effort created from a private-downstream-repo session's operator request (verbatim
  above), surfaced while diagnosing an Intelligence Dampener stuck-review
  incident and a first (reverted) bespoke attempt at Dampener's "View
  reviewer" link.
- Revised `visions/plugins/agent-dispatch` (`durable-attachment-history`) and
  `visions/plugins/agent-bridge` (`resolve-by-any-origin-reference`) ahead of
  this plan, per vision-first discipline.

### 2026-09-19 — Phase 3 implemented downstream, pending merge; Phase 1/Validation Plan retro-check
- The consuming Dampener UI's "View reviewer" link re-implemented via the
  Phase 2 resolver instead of the `dampener-pr<N>` naming convention
  (previously reverted, see the course-correction entry above). Neuron
  Forge's `/dispatch/:taskId` viewer extended (not retired) to fall back to
  the durable resolver after its exact-live attempt fails, after auditing
  its callers first (the Dampener UI's queue/verdicts panels are the only
  consumers today). 535/535 downstream tests pass (7 new); both touched
  packages' `tsc`/`eslint` clean. **Change is open for review downstream,
  not yet merged** — the Plan/Validation Plan checkboxes stay unchecked
  until it lands, per this repo's own convention against marking an item
  complete on an unmerged PR.
- Retro-checked Phase 1 and its Validation Plan item against the merged
  code rather than leaving them stale: the shipped `task_attachments` table
  matches the originally-designed record shape (plus its own internal
  autoincrement row id, outside the designed field set), and
  `test_attachment_history_records_bind_release_and_handoff`
  (`plugins/agent-dispatch/tests/test_queue.py`) already proves the
  no-gaps/no-duplicates multi-release/resume/handoff sequence the
  Validation Plan called for — both were substantively done but left
  unchecked. Backfill remains a deliberate, documented deferral (not a gap).
- Status flips to Done once the downstream Phase 3 change merges — the one
  remaining open item.

### 2026-09-19 — Effort Done: downstream Phase 3 change merged
- The downstream Dampener consumer's Phase 3 change merged. Every actioned
  Plan and Validation Plan item across all three phases is now checked; the
  sole exception is Phase 1's Backfill bullet, which stays unchecked as a
  deliberate, documented deferral rather than an oversight (history starts
  from this effort's landing forward, not reconstructed for prior tasks).
  Status flips to Done.
