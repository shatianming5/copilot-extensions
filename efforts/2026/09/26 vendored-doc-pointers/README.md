  (push-hook bypass, Phase 3 below — a distinct bug surfaced by the same PR,
  tracked in the same effort because both fixes were discovered while
  authoring/landing PR #3554 and the operator asked to track them together)

## Guiding Intent

PR #3554 (`docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`, the cross-plugin
diagnostic playbook) had to hand-duplicate its one canonical file into three
plugins' own vendored `docs/` directories (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-bridge`,
`agent-dispatch`) so the content actually ships with each plugin's marketplace
payload — repo-root `docs/` is never vendored (each plugin's marketplace
`"source"` is scoped to `plugins/<name>` only, confirmed against a real
installed-plugins tree). Keeping three byte-identical copies in sync by hand
is exactly the class of problem `libs/ssh-manager` and its ~10 sibling shared
libraries already have, which the `dev-branch-release-pipeline` effort solved
via a `VENDOR_POINTER.json` sidecar: a lightweight
`{"source": "libs/<lib>"}` stub that `tools/materialize_main.py` expands into
a full copy at `dev` → `main` promotion time. That mechanism is proven
end-to-end (26+ tests, a standalone trial clone) but is scoped only to
`plugins/<plugin>/libs/<lib>/` and has not yet been adopted by any real
plugin.

This effort generalizes that mechanism beyond `libs/` to cover **any**
duplicated payload file — starting with the `entity-relationship-model.md`
mirrors as the first real conversion — so a contributor edits ONE canonical
copy in `dev` and the promotion pipeline expands it into every vendored
location in `main`, instead of hand-copying N times and hoping the copies
never drift (as already happened once this session: a review round caught
content that was fixed in the canonical file but not yet re-synced to all
three mirrors).

Separately, authoring and landing PR #3554 surfaced a real bug in the
mechanism that is supposed to catch exactly this kind of drift locally:
`agent-worktrees`' own `push()` silently disables **all** pre-push hooks
(including `check-changefile-presence.py`) on every real publish push, not
just its internal rebase/squash plumbing — so the release guard that is
documented as "pre-push + CI" only ever actually runs in CI for a
`push-changes`/`create-pr`-driven publish. This effort's Phase 3 fixes that,
tracked jointly here per the operator's explicit request to track both
findings together.

## Participants

| Participant | Role in this effort | Reached via |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| the driving Copilot CLI session | sole driver | its own linked worktree checkout |

## Coordination

- **Topology:** single-driver, per-phase PRs (each phase lands independently
  once its own validation passes — do not bundle Phase 1/2 tooling changes
  with the Phase 3 hook fix in one PR).
- **Host (owns PRs):** the driving session.
- **Delegates:** none currently.
- **Handoff:** via this repo's own context-handoff mechanism; a successor
  picks up at whichever Phase's checklist is first incomplete.

## Context

- The validated prototype this effort generalizes:
  `efforts/active/dev-branch-release-pipeline/README.md` Phase 1 (the
  `VENDOR_POINTER.json` design + `tools/materialize_main.py` +
  `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py --materialize`).
- The concrete pain that motivated this effort:
  `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md` and its three mirrors
  (`plugins/agent-worktrees/docs/`, `plugins/agent-bridge/docs/`,
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/docs/`), introduced by PR #3554 (merged).
- The hook-bypass bug: `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/git_ops.py`
  `push()` — `no_hooks=True` unconditionally, on every push including the
  terminal publish push. See issue #3561 for the full reproduction (a raw
  `git push` missing a changefile is correctly blocked by
  `tools/hooks/pre-push`; the identical case via `agent-worktrees push-changes`
  / `create-pr` is not).

## Request

Per operator direction (session that authored PR #3554):

1. Design and build a generalized vendor-pointer mechanism covering arbitrary
   duplicated files (not just `libs/<lib>/src`), with an "in-language" marker
   where practical (e.g. an HTML comment at the top of a Markdown mirror,
   understandable by an agent reading the file directly, without first
   reading the vendoring tooling's own docs) — see issue #3565 for the open
   design question of whether this fully replaces or supplements the
   JSON-sidecar approach for docs.
2. Convert the three `entity-relationship-model.md` mirrors from hand-copies
   to real pointers using the new mechanism, proving it end-to-end on a real
   file (not just a synthetic test fixture).
3. Fix `agent-worktrees`' `push()` so a real publish push cannot silently
   bypass the release-guard hooks — see issue #3561 for the suggested fix
   shape (distinguish "internal plumbing that re-arranges already-committed
   content" from "the final push that publishes to `origin`").

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Design the generalized pointer mechanism

_Status: designed, implemented, and merged via PR
[#3575](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/pull/3575)._

- [x] Read `tools/materialize_main.py`, `tools/sync-vendored-libs.py`, and the
      `VENDOR_POINTER.json` schema in full; confirm exactly what would need to
      generalize (currently hardcoded to `libs/<lib>/src` + a version-line
      rewrite in `pyproject.toml` — neither applies to a plain doc file).
      Confirmed in PR #3575: neither script's directory-pointer logic
      (copytree + version-line rewrite) applies to a single file; the new
      file-pointer kind needed its own find/expand functions rather than
      reusing the lib case's internals.
- [x] Decide the pointer shape for a non-lib file: reuse
      `VENDOR_POINTER.json` with a generalized `source`/`kind` field, or a
      distinct format. Justify the choice against issue #3565's stated
      preference for an in-language marker. Decided in PR #3575: a distinct
      format -- a single-line HTML-comment marker
      (`<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=<repo-relative-path> kind=file -->`) as
      the file's own first line, not a JSON sidecar. A directory/lib pointer
      can be an empty stub next to a real sibling file (`pyproject.toml`), but
      a single vendored file has no sibling to carry a sidecar without a
      second file appearing in the mirror location -- and issue #3565 asked
      specifically for content an agent can read directly, in the file's own
      language, without first discovering `VENDOR_POINTER.json`'s schema.
      See `tools/materialize_main.py`'s module docstring (PR #3575) for the
      full rationale and both pointer kinds side by side.
- [x] Prototype the in-language marker for Markdown specifically (e.g. an
      HTML comment header) and confirm it round-trips: a human/agent reading
      the `dev`-branch file understands it's a mirror without external docs,
      and the promotion tooling can still parse it mechanically. Built in PR
      #3575: `materialize_main._file_pointer_source()` matches the marker
      line exactly (`kind=file`, `source=` required) via `_FILE_POINTER_RE`;
      an HTML comment is invisible when the Markdown renders but plainly
      visible in source, and materializing overwrites the stub's own content
      with the canonical file's bytes in place (no separate pointer file to
      delete, unlike the lib case).
- [x] Extend `tools/materialize_main.py` (and its test suite) to expand the
      new pointer kind, with the same non-regression guarantees the lib case
      has (never silently wipes canonical, refuses to materialize from a
      stale/missing source). Built in PR #3575: `find_file_pointers()` +
      `materialize_file_pointers()`, wired into `materialize()`/`build()`;
      8 new tests in `test_materialize_main.py` (byte-identical round-trip,
      missing-canonical SKIP leaves the stub untouched, multiple mirrors of
      the same doc, non-pointer files ignored, full `build()` end-to-end,
      plus 3 covering path-traversal refusal, added after a Copilot review
      caught an unvalidated `source` path -- see Journal). Also extended
      `tools/preview_release.py`'s per-plugin materializer
      (`_materialize_file_pointers_into_preview`) to expand file pointers
      into a single-plugin preview copy, matching a gap the Copilot reviewer
      caught on this PR (the per-plugin preview tool only expanded lib
      pointers, so Phase 2's own preview-validation step could not have
      passed without this).

### Phase 2 — Convert the entity-relationship-model.md mirrors
- [x] Convert `plugins/agent-worktrees/docs/entity-relationship-model.md`,
      `plugins/agent-bridge/docs/entity-relationship-model.md`, and
      `plugins/agent-dispatch/docs/entity-relationship-model.md` (merged via
      PR #3554) from full hand-copies to real pointers referencing
      `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`. Done: all three replaced
      with the file-pointer stub (see below); a changefile added for each
      touched plugin per `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s per-plugin-payload-change rule.
- [x] Confirm `tools/preview_release.py`/`tools/materialize_main.py` produce
      byte-identical output to the current hand-copies for all three (Phase 1
      -- merged via PR #3575 -- already extends `preview_release.py`'s
      per-plugin materializer to expand the generalized file-pointer kind,
      not just the lib kind, so this validation can run per-plugin as
      documented). Confirmed: `python tools/materialize_main.py --dest <dir>`
      and `python tools/preview_release.py <plugin>` for all three plugins
      both produced output byte-identical to the pre-conversion hand-copies
      (which were themselves already confirmed byte-identical to canonical).
- [x] Update `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`'s own "See Also"
      section (currently plain-text repo references because the mirrors
      couldn't resolve a relative link) once the mirrors are pointers instead
      of static copies — revisit whether relative links become viable again,
      or whether the plain-text convention should stay regardless. Decided:
      the plain-text convention stays. Materializing a pointer only
      reproduces the canonical file's own bytes (including its relative
      links) into `plugins/<plugin>/docs/`; the link *targets*
      (`docs/patterns/*.md`) still aren't part of any plugin's marketplace
      payload, so a relative link from the materialized copy would still
      resolve to nothing in an installed-plugin context. Pointers fix the
      hand-copy-drift problem, not the cross-payload-boundary problem the
      plain-text convention exists for.


### Phase 3 — Fix the push() hook bypass
- [x] Read `plugins/agent-worktrees/src/agent_worktrees/git_ops.py`'s `push()`
      and every call site to distinguish internal-plumbing pushes (rebase
      retries, mid-flow branch updates) from the terminal publish push.
      Found: all 8 real call sites (`git_collab.py` feature-branch/
      merge-to-feature, `finalize.py` push-changes-to-default-branch and
      PR-branch push, `pr_ops.py`'s 3 PR-branch pushes) are genuine terminal
      publishes to `remote` -- none are pure local plumbing. The `no_hooks`
      rationale from #3707 (client-side branch-guard hooks would corrupt an
      in-flight mechanical squash) applies to the LOCAL squash re-commit and
      `rebase()` calls elsewhere in the same file, not to `push()`'s own
      network operation.
- [x] Land a fix scoped to the terminal publish push only — re-enable the
      release-guard hooks (or explicitly invoke the relevant checks, at
      minimum `check-changefile-presence.py`) for that call, while keeping
      `no_hooks=True`'s existing, still-valid rationale for internal
      rebase/squash plumbing. Done: removed `no_hooks=True` from both `git()`
      calls inside `push()` (the primary push and the auth-fallback retry).
      Wrapped `git_collab.py`'s two un-wrapped push call sites with
      `hooks.allow_pr_push()` (matching the existing pattern in
      `finalize.py`/`pr_ops.py`) so agent-worktrees' own dogfooded PR-workflow
      guard hook still recognizes these as legitimate publishes and doesn't
      newly self-block them now that hooks actually run on push.
- [x] Add a regression test: a push through `push-changes`/`create-pr` with a
      missing required changefile must fail locally, matching the raw
      `git push` behavior already proven in issue #3561's reproduction. Done:
      `test_push_changes_is_blocked_by_a_real_client_side_pre_push_hook`
      installs a real, unconditionally-failing pre-push hook (standing in for
      any repo release guard) in the anchor's common git dir and confirms
      `push_changes` is genuinely blocked (verified this test fails without
      the fix, by temporarily reintroducing `no_hooks=True` and confirming
      the assertion breaks, then restoring the fix).
- [x] Confirm no existing `push-changes`/`create-pr`/`finalize` test suite
      relies on the current bypass behavior (e.g. tests that push
      intentionally-non-compliant content as part of a scratch/synthetic
      fixture) before landing. Confirmed: the full agent-worktrees suite
      (1010 + 247 + 527 tests across 9 sub-suites) passes unchanged after the
      fix; only `test_push_bypasses_hooks` needed updating (renamed to
      `test_push_does_not_bypass_hooks`, its assertion inverted) since it was
      testing the exact bypass this phase removes.

## Validation Plan

- [x] `tools/materialize_main.py`'s test suite covers the new pointer kind
      with the same rigor as the existing lib case (byte-identical
      round-trip, refuses on missing/stale source).
- [x] A real `python tools/preview_release.py <plugin>` run for each of the
      three converted plugins shows no diff against the current hand-copy
      content. Confirmed for agent-worktrees, agent-bridge, agent-dispatch --
      each preview's materialized `docs/entity-relationship-model.md` is
      byte-identical to `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`.
- [x] A reproduction of issue #3561's exact scenario (push a commit touching
      a plugin's payload with no changefile, through `push-changes`/
      `create-pr`, not raw `git push`) is now blocked locally, matching CI.
      Confirmed via `test_push_changes_is_blocked_by_a_real_client_side_pre_push_hook`
      (Phase 3) -- a real client-side pre-push hook now genuinely blocks
      `push_changes`, verified to fail without the fix and pass with it.
- [x] `python tools/check-changefile-presence.py` and
      `python tools/check-docs-consistency.py` both pass after each phase's
      changes. Confirmed after Phase 2 (a changefile was required and added
      for each of the three touched plugins, unlike Phase 1's repo-root-only
      `tools/` change).

## Proposal

**File-pointer format (decided and implemented in Phase 1, PR
[#3575](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/pull/3575),
merged):** a vendored file's first line is an HTML comment marker:

```
<!-- VENDOR_POINTER: source=<repo-relative-path> kind=file -->
```

This is distinct from the directory/lib pointer's `VENDOR_POINTER.json`
sidecar -- a single vendored file has no sibling location to carry a JSON
sidecar without introducing a second file at the mirror's path, and the
kickoff request specifically asked for a marker readable in the file's own
language, without needing to discover the JSON schema first. On `dev` the
mirror file's content is a short stub (the marker line plus a one-paragraph
human/agent-readable explanation); at promotion time
`tools/materialize_main.py`'s `materialize_file_pointers()` overwrites that
stub's content in place with the canonical file's bytes (no separate pointer
file to delete, unlike the lib case, since the pointer *is* the mirrored
file). `tools/preview_release.py`'s per-plugin preview materializer expands
the same pointer kind, scoped to the one plugin being previewed.

See `tools/materialize_main.py`'s module docstring for the full two-kind
comparison and `tools/test_materialize_main.py` /
`tools/test_preview_release.py` for the round-trip test coverage.

## Journal

### 2026-09-26 — Archived
Every Plan and Validation Plan item is resolved. Moved to the dated archive
path as part of a batch archive sweep of completed efforts.

### 2026-09-24 — Kickoff
- Effort created while working on PR #3554
  (`docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`, still open at the time)
  surfaced two related findings: (1) the same doc-duplication problem
  `dev-branch-release-pipeline` already solved for shared libs, not yet
  generalized to docs, and (2) a real bug in `agent-worktrees push()` that
  silently bypasses the pre-push release-guard hooks documented as the local
  enforcement point for exactly this kind of drift. Filed the umbrella issue
  (#3565) and cross-referenced the pre-existing hook-bypass issue (#3561).
  Handed off immediately after kickoff per operator direction — no phase work
  started yet.

### 2026-09-24/25 — Phase 1 merged (PR #3575)
- Designed and built the generalized file-pointer mechanism: an in-language
  HTML-comment marker (see Proposal above), `materialize_main.py`'s
  `find_file_pointers()`/`materialize_file_pointers()`, and
  `preview_release.py`'s per-plugin equivalent. 8 new tests in
  `test_materialize_main.py` and 1 in `test_preview_release.py` (23 total
  across both files, all passing);
  `ruff check` clean; `check-docs-consistency.py` and
  `check-changefile-presence.py` both pass (no changefile needed -- these are
  repo-root `tools/` changes, not a plugin payload). Opened as its own PR
  (#3575) per this effort's own per-phase-PR coordination
  rule, in a fresh worktree (not PR #3554's or #3566's) since neither of
  those branches was the right home for Phase 1 code.
- Two review rounds on PR #3554 and #3566 (the two prior open PRs, watched
  through to keep them from going stale) caught: a false-positive "ten
  durable" claim on #3554 (checked -- both the PR description and the doc
  already correctly said "nine durable, one transient"; replied and requested
  a fresh review rather than editing already-correct content); an
  unresolvable Vision reference on #3566 (the cited `visions/plugin-services`
  section doesn't exist on `dev` yet -- it's proposed by the still-open
  PR #3554 -- made the dependency explicit); and an inaccurate "landed via
  PR #3554" claim (that PR is still open) fixed to "introduced by"/"proposed
  by" in two places. A third, structurally important finding on #3566 (this
  effort's own Validation Plan calls for a per-plugin `preview_release.py`
  run to show no diff, but that tool's materializer only expanded lib
  pointers) became the extra `preview_release.py` extension folded into this
  same Phase 1 PR rather than deferred to Phase 2, since Phase 2's validation
  step cannot pass without it.
- PR #3575 also had a real Copilot-review catch: `materialize_file_pointers()`
  joined `canonical_root` with an unvalidated marker `source`, letting an
  absolute path or `../` traversal escape the trusted root. Fixed with
  `_resolve_within()` (resolves + confirms containment, symlinks included)
  before this PR was merged; 3 regression tests added.
- All three PRs (#3554, #3566, #3575) merged. `dev`'s own CI ran green after
  each merge, and the `dev` → `main` promotion pipeline fired successfully
  (release/promote-36100513912, merged). Phase 1 is complete; Phase 2 (convert
  the three real mirrors to file pointers) is next.

### 2026-09-25 — Phase 2 opened

- Converted all three real mirrors
  (`plugins/agent-worktrees/docs/`, `plugins/agent-bridge/docs/`,
  `plugins/agent-dispatch/docs/entity-relationship-model.md`) from hand-copies
  to the file-pointer stub built in Phase 1. Confirmed before conversion that
  each hand-copy's body (past its own 3-line header comment) was already
  byte-identical to canonical -- so the conversion changes only *how* the
  content stays in sync, not the content itself.
- Validated both materializers: `tools/materialize_main.py --dest <dir>` and
  `tools/preview_release.py <plugin>` for all three plugins both produced a
  materialized `entity-relationship-model.md` byte-identical to
  `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`.
- Added a changefile for each of the three touched plugins
  (`tools/changefile.py add --plugin <name> --type patch`), per
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s per-plugin-payload-change rule -- Phase 1 didn't need
  one (repo-root `tools/` only), Phase 2 does.
- Decided the third checklist item (the doc's "See Also" section): the
  plain-text link convention stays. A materialized pointer only reproduces
  canonical's own bytes into `plugins/<plugin>/docs/`; the link targets
  (`docs/patterns/*.md`) still aren't part of any plugin's marketplace
  payload, so a relative link would still resolve to nothing installed. Left
  `docs/patterns/entity-relationship-model.md`'s "See Also" section
  unchanged.

### 2026-09-25 — Phase 3 opened; all three phases complete

- Fixed the `push()` hook bypass (#3561): removed `no_hooks=True` from both
  `git()` calls inside `push()` -- the primary push and the auth-fallback
  retry. Read all 8 real call sites first to confirm every one is a genuine
  terminal publish (none are pure local plumbing), so the fix is unconditional
  rather than needing a caller-supplied flag.
- Wrapped `git_collab.py`'s two previously-un-wrapped push call sites
  (`feature-branch --push`, `merge-to-feature --push`) with
  `hooks.allow_pr_push()`, matching the existing pattern already used in
  `finalize.py`/`pr_ops.py` -- needed because those two calls now run with
  real hooks active, and agent-worktrees' own dogfooded PR-workflow guard
  hook must still recognize them as legitimate publishes.
- Added a real end-to-end regression test
  (`test_push_changes_is_blocked_by_a_real_client_side_pre_push_hook`):
  installs an unconditionally-failing pre-push hook in a real bare-repo
  fixture's common git dir and confirms `push_changes` is genuinely blocked.
  Verified the test actually catches the regression -- temporarily
  reintroduced `no_hooks=True` in `push()`, watched the new test fail, then
  restored the fix and watched it pass again.
- Updated `test_push_bypasses_hooks` -> `test_push_does_not_bypass_hooks`
  (inverted assertion) since it was testing the exact bypass this phase
  removes; added `test_push_retry_also_does_not_bypass_hooks` for the
  auth-fallback path. Confirmed no other test in the full agent-worktrees
  suite (1010 + 247 + 527 tests, 9 sub-suites) relied on the old bypass.
- All three phases' Plan and Validation Plan items are now checked off. This
  effort is Done, pending the normal archive-to-`efforts/<YYYY>/MM/DD/` step.
