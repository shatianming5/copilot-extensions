- **Umbrella issue:** #2640
- **Sub-issues:** _to be filed once the Plan below is reviewed and phases are ready to claim_

## Guiding Intent

`agent-worktrees cleanup` deletes worktrees. Between the moment it decides a
worktree is safe to delete and the moment it actually deletes it, the world
can change — a dirty edit lands, a session attaches, a claim reopens the
record. The system must never act on a stale safety decision: whatever made a
worktree "safe to reap" must still be true **at the instant of deletion**, not
merely at scan time. PR #2635 established this principle for one path (batch
`cleanup --clean`, and only for two of its several safety signals); this
effort finishes it properly, as one deliberate design pass rather than another
round of reactive per-finding patches.

## Context

PR [#2635](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/pull/2635) fixed
the core bug: a worktree finalized earlier and modified afterward carried a
stale `rec.status == "finalized"` tracking status, and both
`_apply_tracking_override` and `prune.cleanup_disposition` trusted that status
without checking `info.dirty` — so plain `cleanup --clean` could delete
genuinely unlanded, uncommitted content with no `--force` involved at all.
That PR, across five review rounds, fixed:

- the finalized-status override masking `DIRTY` (and `ORPHAN`-with-dirty, and
  a cache-reconstructed-state case with `state == DIRTY, dirty == 0`);
- the same independent bug inside `cleanup_disposition` itself;
- a first-pass **under-lock revalidation** (`_revalidate_before_reap`) for the
  **batch** `cleanup --clean` path only, re-checking **dirty and active**
  right before each reap.

During that PR's final review pass, `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` surfaced
three further gaps in the same family, deliberately deferred rather than
expanding an already five-round PR further:

1. **`reap_one` (single-worktree `cleanup --worktree-id <id>`) has no
   revalidation at all.** It classifies before taking the lifecycle lock,
   then reaps after checking only hosted-session metadata. The exact race
   `_revalidate_before_reap` closed for the batch path is wide open here.
2. **`_revalidate_before_reap` itself uses a stale `active_paths` snapshot.**
   That snapshot (built by `_build_active_paths`) is captured once, before the
   finalization lock. A mux/lock session that attaches to a worktree *after*
   the initial scan is invisible to the revalidation's fresh git
   classification, so a clean finalized record can still be reaped out from
   under a newly attached session.
3. **Only dirty/active are re-checked — not the complete safety decision.**
   Between the initial scan and the lock, a candidate can also gain a
   committed WIP change, finish a conversation (updating `session_turns`), or
   acquire a held claim/follow-up that reopens its record. All of those
   should block cleanup (the WIP gate, `--include-conversations` gate, the
   held-claims/follow-up/paired-sibling gates in `cleanup_disposition`) — but
   none of them are re-checked today, only dirty/active are.

This effort's own review (rounds 3–4, on the plan itself) surfaced four more
concrete findings that sharpen the above rather than replace it — folded in
as explicit Plan items rather than re-litigated in prose here:

- `cleanup_disposition`'s `rec.status == "finalized" or info.state ==
  COMPLETED` shortcut runs **before** its `WIP` and `conversation-only`
  branches — so even a full "re-run cleanup_disposition" does not, by
  itself, catch a finalized record that gained a committed WIP change or
  fresh conversation turns after the scan. This needs the same kind of
  ordering fix PR #2635 already made for `dirty` (moving that gate ahead of
  the finalized shortcut), extended to `WIP`/`conversation-only`.
- `_build_active_paths` itself has a stale-cache fallback: when the batched
  mux query is unavailable, it treats a cached `mux_live=False` as
  authoritative and skips the `has_mux_session` fallback check — so a
  session attached after that false stamp is still invisible, independent
  of when `active_paths` is (re)built.
- Other record mutators — session registration, claim/follow-up writes —
  use a **per-record lock**, not `FinalizeLock`. "Hold `FinalizeLock`
  across the final read and the reap" (Phase 2's Option 1) only fences
  against this tool's *other* finalization/cleanup instances; it does not
  fence against those writers, which can still change safety inputs after
  the final read. Closing that gap needs either those writers to also
  honor `FinalizeLock`, or a target-record lock/CAS with an explicitly
  defined lock order.
- There is a **third** ordinary reaper beyond the two originally scoped
  here: `sweep_finished_session_worktrees` builds its candidates before
  `FinalizeLock` and calls `_reap_worktree` under the lock with no fresh
  safety decision — the same stale check-to-delete race, in the
  no-daemon/picker/session-end auto-clean path. In scope alongside the
  batch and single-item paths below; "two call sites" throughout this
  document should be read as **three**.

### Why this earns a real design pass, not another quick patch

The pattern so far has been: fix the symptom the reviewer just found, in the
exact spot it was found. That produced a working batch-path fix, but it also
produced the very gaps this effort exists to close — `reap_one` (and, per the
findings above, `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`) never got the fix because
each is a *separate* call site that happens to reimplement the same "check
then act" shape. Patching gap-by-gap in-place risks a fourth and fifth gap
surfacing the same way — as this very plan's own review rounds just
demonstrated. The fix that actually closes the class of bug is **one
canonical, single-sourced safety recheck**, called from every site that reaps
a worktree — so there is no other call site left to drift out of sync.

(Operator instruction, captured verbatim, following the merge of PR #2635 and
the decision to defer the three review findings above to a tracked follow-up
rather than expand that PR further.)

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Investigate the current liveness/safety-signal landscape

Before consolidating anything, map what already exists so the fix doesn't
duplicate or fight an existing mechanism:

- [x] Enumerate every signal `cleanup_disposition` currently consults
      (`info.state`/`info.dirty`, `rec.status`, `turn_count`, held resource
      claims via the injected `claimant_alive` probe, itemized follow-ups,
      paired-sibling finality, PR state via `assess`) and, for each, whether
      it can be **cheaply re-derived locally** (no network) at reap time, or
      requires a network/remote round-trip that should stay scan-time-only
      by design or needs an explicit bounded-wait policy under the lock.
      **Findings (see Journal):** all signals are cheap-local (a fresh
      `git_ops.classify_worktree(fetch=False, ...)` call, a fresh
      `tracking.load_record`, or a plain record-field read) **except**
      `claimant_alive`, which is cheap only for a same-machine owner and
      degrades to a bounded (8 s) SSH round-trip for a cross-machine owner.
      PR state (`rec.prs`/`assess`'s PR-aware branch) is the one signal that
      must **stay scan-time-only**: it is populated by `reconcile_and_persist_best_effort`
      calling out to the PR provider, and Phase 2 explicitly must not add a
      network reconciliation under the lock.
- [x] **`claimant_alive`** (`resolve_claimant_alive`) specifically: this probe
      can perform a **cross-machine SSH check** and intentionally returns
      *unknown* on failure — it is not a cheap local read like the others.
      Decide and document an explicit under-lock policy for it: a bounded
      timeout, and whether "unknown" fails closed (treat as still-live, don't
      reap) or is otherwise handled — the design must not silently drop this
      gate, and must not let the lifecycle lock block indefinitely on remote
      I/O. **Findings (see Journal):** `claimant.py` already bounds the
      remote path to `_REMOTE_TIMEOUT = 8.0` seconds and the tri-state
      contract (`True`/`False`/`None`) already fails closed — `assess()`
      only lets a resource fall through to its content verdict when
      `claimant_alive(...)` returns `False` (confirmed gone); `True` *or*
      `None` (unconfirmed) both spare it. So the policy exists today; the
      open design question Phase 2 must settle is narrower than "invent a
      policy" — it's "do we hold `FinalizeLock` for up to 8 s of SSH I/O per
      candidate," since today's `reap_one` non-forced path already calls
      `cleanup_disposition` (and therefore `resolve_claimant_alive`)
      pre-lock, so wiring the *consolidated* revalidation to call it again
      under the lock is what would newly introduce that cost.
- [x] Trace exactly how `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup(latest)` (already
      called under the lock today, in both `cmd_cleanup` and presumably
      `reap_one`) relates to `active_paths`/mux-session liveness — are these
      the *same* liveness signal read two different ways, or genuinely
      independent? Document the answer; don't build a second, divergent
      liveness check if one already exists under the lock. **Findings (see
      Journal):** genuinely independent. `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup`
      (`__main__.py:377`) only looks at record fields — `session_backend_opaque`,
      `execution_leg_opaque`, and `tracking.derive_execution_leg(record).state
      in {"active", "unknown"}` — none of which involve `active_paths`, mux,
      or lock files. It covers **hosted**/cloud-backend Copilot sessions that
      leave no local mux/lock trace. `active_paths` (`_build_active_paths`,
      `__main__.py:388`) instead covers local lock-file sessions, batched
      tmux/psmux mux sessions, cached `mux_live`/`bound_live` hints, and
      bridge-lock liveness. Both signals are already consulted (the former
      fresh, under the lock, in `reap_one`/`cmd_cleanup`; the latter only
      pre-lock today) — the consolidated function needs **both**, not a
      merged/replaced single check.
- [x] Confirm `reap_one`'s current shape precisely, **including its `force`
      path**: `reap_one` deliberately bypasses `cleanup_disposition` when
      `force=True`, while still rejecting an active session — the skill
      documents `--force` as an individually-verified exception, not
      something this effort should remove or weaken. Document the forced and
      non-forced contracts **separately** so Phase 2's design doesn't
      conflate them. **Findings (see Journal):** confirmed exactly as
      described, with one added precision — the *initial* ACTIVE check
      (`info.state == git_ops.WorktreeState.ACTIVE`, `__main__.py:13580`) is
      shared by **both** forced and non-forced paths and runs **before** the
      lock, against the pre-lock `active_paths` snapshot built at
      `__main__.py:13558`. **Non-forced:** additionally calls
      `prune.cleanup_disposition` pre-lock (`__main__.py:13612`); under the
      lock it only re-checks `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup(latest)`
      (`__main__.py:13641`) — no fresh git reclassification, no fresh
      `active_paths`, no fresh `claimant_alive`/held-claims/follow-up/branch-merge
      recheck. This is gap #1: zero revalidation of the actual disposition.
      **Forced:** skips `cleanup_disposition` entirely (the `if not force:`
      guard at `__main__.py:13595`); still subject to the same pre-lock
      ACTIVE check and the same under-lock fresh `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup`
      check as the non-forced path — so `--force` today bypasses only the
      *disposition* (dirty/WIP/claims/etc.), never the active-session
      rejection, matching the documented contract. The gap specific to
      forced mode: the *initial* ACTIVE check it does share is still
      evaluated against the stale pre-lock `active_paths`, so a session that
      attaches between the scan and the lock is invisible to `--force` too
      (Phase 2/4's dedicated forced-attach-after-scan case).

### Phase 2 — Design the consolidated revalidation function

- [x] Design one function (tentatively `_revalidate_cleanup_safety`,
      replacing `_revalidate_before_reap`) that, given a worktree id, does
      **all** of: reload the tracking record fresh, re-classify git state
      fresh (`classify_worktree`, no fetch), refresh the liveness signal(s)
      identified in Phase 1 scoped to just this one worktree (not a full
      fleet rescan), re-derive `turn_count` from current session state, and
      run the **complete** `cleanup_disposition` against all of that —
      returning the fresh record, classification, disposition, and reason
      rather than a narrowed dirty/active-only check.
      **Decision:** signature
      `_revalidate_cleanup_safety(wt_id: str, *, repo: cfg.RepoConfig,
      force: bool = False) -> RevalidationResult`, taking only the id (not a
      pre-lock record/info) so it cannot accidentally read anything but
      fresh state. Callers acquire `FinalizeLock` (and, for non-forced, the
      per-record lock — see the lock-order decision below) *before* calling
      it, and it is the **sole** place any of the three reapers touches
      `cleanup_disposition`/`classify_worktree`/`resolve_claimant_alive` once
      the lock is held. It builds a **single-worktree** `active_paths` via
      `_build_active_paths([rec], session_ctx)` scoped to just this record
      (not a fleet rescan), matching Phase 1's confirmation that this is
      already how `reap_one` computes it today — only the *timing* (under
      lock vs. before it) changes.
- [x] **"Re-run `cleanup_disposition`" is necessary but not yet sufficient
      by itself — its internal ordering has the same class of bug PR #2635
      fixed for `dirty`, but for `WIP`/`conversation-only`.**
      `cleanup_disposition`'s `rec.status == "finalized" or info.state ==
      COMPLETED` shortcut runs *before* its `WIP` and `conversation-only`
      branches, so a finalized record that gains a committed WIP change or
      fresh conversation turns after the scan is still returned cleanable —
      exactly the bug #2635 fixed for `dirty`/`info.dirty`, recurring for
      two more signals. This design must either reorder those gates ahead
      of the finalized shortcut (mirroring #2635's fix) or otherwise ensure
      the consolidated function checks them before trusting that shortcut —
      "call `cleanup_disposition` again" is not sufficient on its own.
      **Decision:** fix `cleanup_disposition` itself (`prune.py`), not just
      its caller — move the `info.state == S.WIP` and the `empty`/
      `conversation-only` category checks (currently reached only after the
      `rec.status == "finalized" or info.state == COMPLETED` shortcut) ahead
      of that shortcut, mirroring exactly how `#2635` already moved the
      `info.dirty` check ahead of it. This benefits every caller of
      `cleanup_disposition`, not only the revalidator, and keeps there being
      one ordering fix rather than a second one duplicated inside the new
      function.
- [x] `_build_active_paths` has its own stale-cache fallback, independent of
      *when* it's called: when the batched mux query is unavailable, it
      treats a cached `mux_live=False` as authoritative and skips the
      `has_mux_session` fallback check — so a session attached after that
      false cache stamp is invisible even to a freshly-called
      `_build_active_paths`. The liveness refresh this design adds must
      either fix that fallback or use a different, authoritative action-time
      probe instead of relying on `_build_active_paths` as-is.
      **Decision:** fix the fallback in `_build_active_paths` itself
      (`__main__.py:415`-`430`) — when the batched `mux_sessions` query is
      unavailable, always fall through to the authoritative
      `sessions.has_mux_session(rec.worktree_id)` probe regardless of
      whether `_fresh_mux_live_hint` returns `True`, `False`, or `None`; a
      fresh `True` hint can still short-circuit the OR (already correct),
      but a fresh `False` must no longer skip the fallback probe. This is a
      one-line change (drop the `hint is None` guard on the `elif`) that
      fixes the signal for every caller, including callers unrelated to
      this effort's under-lock revalidation — no separate probe needed in
      the new function.
- [x] **The function's return contract must include the fresh record and
      classification, not only the disposition/reason.** Today's callers
      still pass the *pre-lock* record/`info` objects into `_reap_worktree`
      after revalidating — if the revalidator's fresh state isn't threaded
      through as what actually gets reaped, the delete can act on stale
      path, branch, or lifecycle metadata even after a correct fresh
      decision. Make "the reap acts on the revalidated record and
      classification" part of the contract, not just "the decision was
      fresh."
      **Decision:** `RevalidationResult` is a dataclass
      `(cleanable: bool, reason: str, bucket: str, record:
      tracking.WorktreeRecord | None, info: git_ops.WorktreeStateInfo |
      None)` — `record`/`info` populated only when `cleanable`. Every call
      site's `_reap_worktree(rec, info, ...)` is updated to use
      `result.record`/`result.info`, never the pre-lock objects, closing
      the "fresh decision, stale delete" gap named in the plan.
- [x] Decide explicitly between "recompute everything fresh" (this function
      re-decides from scratch) vs. "fail closed on any detected drift"
      (compare a fingerprint of relevant inputs at scan vs. reap time, abort
      on any difference without re-deciding) for inputs that are cheap to
      re-derive locally — the reviewer's review comment left both as
      acceptable; Phase 1's findings on per-signal re-derivation cost should
      settle this per-signal, not necessarily uniformly.
      **Decision:** recompute everything fresh for every signal Phase 1
      classified as cheap-local (git state, record fields, turn count,
      paired-sibling, `active_paths`) — a fingerprint/diff approach adds a
      second code path (compute-then-compare) for no savings when the
      underlying read is already cheap and local. `claimant_alive` is the
      one signal that is *not* uniformly cheap (bounded 8 s SSH for a
      cross-machine owner); it is still recomputed fresh rather than
      fingerprinted, because a fingerprint of "was it alive at scan time"
      is exactly the stale read this effort exists to eliminate — the cost
      is accepted (see the Phase 1 finding above) rather than designed
      around, since it is bounded and only paid once per reap candidate,
      already under the lock in today's non-forced `reap_one` path.
- [x] Explicitly scope what stays out: this function must not perform a
      network PR reconciliation under the lock (that's `--reconcile-prs`'s
      job, at scan time) — confirm this constraint is testable, not just
      assumed.
      **Decision:** `_revalidate_cleanup_safety` never calls
      `prune.reconcile_and_persist_best_effort` or any PR-provider lookup;
      it reads `rec.prs` as already reconciled at scan time (or not
      reconciled at all, in which case a stale `open` fails safe toward
      "don't reap"). Testable via a unit test that patches the PR-provider
      lookup to raise/track-calls and asserts it is never invoked from
      inside the revalidator or from within the `FinalizeLock` critical
      section (Phase 4).
- [x] `prune.cleanup_disposition` deliberately excludes `GONE` — the
      branch-merged-content proof for a missing worktree directory is owned
      by the **caller** (today, both the batch and single-item paths perform
      that proof *before* the lock, and `_revalidate_before_reap` skips
      revalidation entirely for a missing path). A worktree's branch can
      become unmerged relative to the default branch *after* that pre-lock
      proof and before the reap — the consolidated function must fold this
      caller-owned gate into the under-lock decision too, not just the
      signals `cleanup_disposition` itself already covers.
      **Decision:** `_revalidate_cleanup_safety` re-checks
      `git_ops.is_branch_merged(rec.branch, upstream, cwd=repo.anchor)`
      itself, under the lock, whenever the fresh classification comes back
      `GONE` — this is a local git ref comparison (no fetch), not a network
      PR lookup, so it doesn't conflict with the "stays out" scope above.
- [x] **Define the forced-path contract explicitly and separately from the
      full revalidation.** `reap_one --force` is meant to remain an
      individually-verified escape hatch (per the `worktree` skill's
      documented `--force` semantics from #2635), not a second thing this
      consolidation silently removes or changes. Specify precisely what a
      forced reap still re-checks under the lock (at minimum: the existing
      active-session rejection) versus what only the non-forced path
      re-checks (the full consolidated disposition) — as two named
      contracts, not one blended description.
      **Decision — two named contracts:**
      **Non-forced contract:** `_revalidate_cleanup_safety(wt_id,
      force=False)` reloads the record, reclassifies git state, refreshes
      `active_paths`/`_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup`, re-derives
      `turn_count`, calls `claimant_alive`/`paired_sibling_final`, and runs
      the (ordering-fixed) `cleanup_disposition` in full; any non-cleanable
      verdict aborts the reap with `result.reason`.
      **Forced contract:** `_revalidate_cleanup_safety(wt_id, force=True)`
      skips `cleanup_disposition` entirely (dirty/WIP/claims/follow-ups/
      branch-merge are NOT re-checked — `--force` still means "override
      the disposition") but still refreshes liveness under the lock and
      rejects on `ACTIVE` state or a true `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup`
      — the *one* check `--force` has never bypassed, per the `worktree`
      skill. This is the same shape `reap_one` has today, just with the
      liveness refresh moved under the lock (see next item) instead of
      reusing the pre-lock snapshot.
- [x] **The forced path's active-session check must itself be a fresh,
      under-lock liveness read — not the pre-lock `active_paths`
      snapshot.** `reap_one` computes `active_paths` *before* acquiring
      `FinalizeLock` and, when `force=True`, skips the non-forced
      revalidation entirely; if the active-session rejection it *does* keep
      still consults that stale pre-lock snapshot, a session attaching
      between the scan and the lock is invisible even in forced mode, and
      `--force` can terminate a session it was never meant to touch. Both
      the forced and non-forced contracts refresh liveness under the lock;
      only the *disposition* (dirty/WIP/claims/etc.) differs between them.
      **Decision:** confirmed by the contract above —
      `_revalidate_cleanup_safety` computes its own fresh, single-worktree
      `active_paths` and calls `classify_worktree` itself in **both**
      `force` branches, before the `if force` fork that decides whether to
      also run `cleanup_disposition`. There is exactly one liveness-read
      code path inside the function, shared by both contracts; only the
      disposition call is conditional on `force`.
- [x] **Acknowledge and design for the residual TOCTOU window explicitly —
      revalidating "right before" the reap does not make check-and-delete
      indivisible, and "hold `FinalizeLock` throughout" is necessary but not
      sufficient.** `FinalizeLock` serializes this tool's own
      finalization/cleanup instances against each other; it does **not**
      fence out an external edit, or the tool's **own other writers** —
      session registration and claim/follow-up mutations use a *per-record*
      lock (not `FinalizeLock`), so they can still change safety inputs
      after the final read and before `_reap_worktree`, even while
      `FinalizeLock` is held throughout the critical section. Two acceptable
      outcomes, to be decided here rather than left implicit:
      1. **Shrink the window to one held critical section, and make it
         actually exclusive against this tool's own writers** — perform the
         final classification/liveness read and the `_reap_worktree` call
         as a single, uninterrupted sequence while continuously holding
         `FinalizeLock`, **and** either (a) make session-registration and
         claim/follow-up writers also acquire `FinalizeLock` (or a
         compatible lock, with an explicitly defined lock order to avoid
         deadlock with existing per-record-lock callers), or (b) use a
         non-degrading target-record lock (`require_sidecar=True`, failing
         closed on timeout) or CAS (a generation token bumped by every
         writer, checked immediately before the reap) so a write racing the
         critical section is detected even without a shared lock. The
         default `_RecordLock` mode is insufficient because it may proceed
         on only its in-process lock after sidecar timeout. Whichever of
         (a)/(b) is chosen, **explicitly document that a true fence
         against arbitrary *external* actors (an editor, a directly-invoked
         git command outside this tool entirely) remains out of scope**
         unless a further mechanism (e.g., marking the worktree read-only
         for the duration of the critical section) is deliberately adopted
         as a stretch goal.
      2. **Or** adopt that further external-fencing mechanism if the
         residual risk from (1) is judged unacceptable even for in-tool
         writers, and specify exactly what it is, with its own cost/
         complexity tradeoff spelled out.
      Either way, the plan must say which was chosen and why, rather than
      implying "hold `FinalizeLock` across the final read and the reap"
      already closes the race against every writer to zero.
      **Decision: Option 1(b).** `_revalidate_cleanup_safety`'s
      non-forced contract, in addition to holding `FinalizeLock`
      throughout, opens `tracking._RecordLock(yaml_path,
      require_sidecar=True)` for the fresh-read-through-reap window and
      keeps it held until `_reap_worktree` returns — `require_sidecar=True`
      means it **raises `TimeoutError`** (fail closed, skip that
      worktree with a "revalidation lock contended" reason) rather than
      degrading to the in-process-only lock, unlike the default critical-
      writer mode. This works because `tracking.py`'s own docstring already
      establishes that every RMW writer this effort cares about (resource
      claims, follow-ups, session registration's `mark_resumed`, etc.) goes
      through the *same* `_RecordLock` sidecar for its own short RMW window
      — so holding it for the revalidate-then-reap window fences those
      writers out for free, with **no new lock primitive and no explicit
      lock-order table to maintain**, at the cost of an explicit, small
      **lock-order constraint**: `FinalizeLock` is acquired first (already
      true today), `_RecordLock` second, and no other code path may acquire
      them in the reverse order — verified by Phase 4's lock-ordering test.
      A true external fence (an editor, a bare `git` command run outside
      the tool) remains explicitly out of scope, same as before — this
      closes the race against the tool's own writers, not against arbitrary
      external actors, and the Journal/Phase 5 docs must say so plainly.
      **Forced mode does not take `_RecordLock`** (matching its narrower
      contract of "only the fresh liveness read, no disposition re-check"),
      since it isn't gated on the same set of writer-mutable fields.

### Phase 3 — Wire all three reaper call sites through it

- [x] Route `cmd_cleanup`'s batch loop through the consolidated function
      (replacing today's narrower `_revalidate_before_reap` call).
- [x] Route `reap_one` (`cleanup --worktree-id <id>`) through the *same*
      function for its **non-forced** path — this is the actual fix for gap
      #1; it must not gain its own parallel implementation. Its **forced**
      path keeps the narrower, separately-specified contract from Phase 2
      (active-session rejection only) — force stays force.
- [x] Route `sweep_finished_session_worktrees` (the no-daemon/picker/
      session-end auto-clean path) through the same consolidated function
      too — it builds candidates pre-lock and reaps under the lock with no
      fresh safety decision today, the identical race being fixed
      elsewhere. Recompute its idle-grace input at action time from fresh mux
      activity and tracking timestamps so activity after candidate selection
      postpones removal. If this reaper's constraints (e.g. no `force`
      concept, a narrower record shape) make full reuse awkward, that's a
      Phase 2 design input, not a reason to leave it out — resolve the shape
      during design, don't scope it out by default.
- [x] Remove the now-superseded `_revalidate_before_reap` (or fold it into
      the new function) so there is exactly one non-forced revalidation code
      path left, not two that can drift apart again.

**Implemented** in `_revalidate_cleanup_safety` (`__main__.py`), replacing
`_revalidate_before_reap` entirely — see the 2026-09-14 Phase 3 Journal
entry for the concrete shape and the two upstream bugs fixed alongside it.

### Phase 4 — Regression coverage

Each bullet below is **one named test per signal, per reaper, per mode** —
not a bundled scenario covering several transitions at once. The full matrix
crosses: **signal** (dirty, WIP, new conversation turn, held claim,
follow-up, active session, branch-merge/GONE, claimant-liveness-unknown)
× **reaper** (batch `cleanup --clean`, single `cleanup --worktree-id`,
automatic `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`)
× **mode** (non-forced; forced, for the single-item reaper only, per
Phase 2's forced-path contract). Concretely, at minimum:

- [x] Batch, non-forced: dirty-after-scan refused (already covered by
      #2635 — confirm it still passes through the consolidated function).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: active-session-after-scan refused (closes gap #2).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: WIP-after-scan refused (closes part of gap #3).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: a record already marked `finalized` that gains WIP
      after the scan is covered through the actual `cmd_cleanup` call site and
      pinned as the known [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649)
      limitation (the finalized-status mask), rather than silently left
      untested.
- [x] Batch, non-forced: new-conversation-turn-after-scan refused, i.e. an
      `empty`/`unused` candidate that gained turns and would need
      `--include-conversations` (closes part of gap #3).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: a record already marked `finalized` that gains a
      conversation turn after the scan is covered through the actual
      `cmd_cleanup` call site and pinned as the known
      [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649)
      limitation, rather than silently left untested.
- [x] Batch, non-forced: held-claim-or-follow-up-reopened-after-scan
      refused (closes part of gap #3).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: branch-becomes-unmerged-after-scan refused (the
      `GONE`/branch-merge caller-owned gate).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: `claimant_alive` returns unknown under the lock —
      exercises the exact bounded-wait/fail-closed policy Phase 1/2 define
      (not just a happy-path alive/gone result).
- [x] Batch, non-forced: when the batched mux query is unavailable and the
      record has a fresh cached `mux_live=False`, a mux session attached after
      that stamp is still found by the authoritative action-time probe (or the
      reap fails closed if the probe is unavailable).
- [x] Single-item (`reap_one`), non-forced: dirty/active/WIP/conversation/
      claim/follow-up/branch-merge-after-scan each refused, mirroring the
      batch cases above — this is the direct fix for gap #1 (currently zero
      coverage); the finalized-record WIP and conversation variants are
      likewise covered through `reap_one()` itself and pinned as the known
      [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649)
      limitation.
- [x] Single-item (`reap_one`), non-forced: the unavailable-batch-query plus
      fresh cached `mux_live=False` race is resolved by the authoritative
      action-time probe or fails closed.
- [x] Single-item (`reap_one`), **forced**: an active session is still
      rejected (the one check `--force` does not bypass); a merely dirty/WIP/
      claimed worktree **is** removed when forced (confirms `--force` still
      works as documented, i.e. this effort does not regress the escape
      hatch).
- [x] Single-item (`reap_one`), **forced**, **session attaches *after* the
      pre-lock scan** (not merely already-active at scan time): still
      rejected. This is the specific reviewer-identified gap — `force`
      bypasses the disposition checks but must not bypass a *fresh*
      liveness read, since `active_paths` is otherwise only ever computed
      before `FinalizeLock` is acquired.
- [x] Single-item (`reap_one`), **forced**: the same post-scan attachment is
      detected when the batched mux query is unavailable and the record has a
      fresh cached `mux_live=False`, or the action-time probe fails closed.
- [x] Automatic finished-session sweep, non-forced: each dirty, active, WIP,
      new-conversation-turn, held-claim, follow-up, branch-merge/GONE, and
      claimant-liveness-unknown transition after candidate selection is
      refused in its own named test; the finalized-record WIP and conversation
      variants are likewise covered through the real sweep and pinned as the
      known [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649)
      limitation.
- [x] Automatic finished-session sweep, non-forced: activity after candidate
      selection refreshes the idle-grace timestamp and postpones removal even
      when no session remains live at reap time.
- [x] Automatic finished-session sweep, non-forced: the unavailable-batch-query
      plus fresh cached `mux_live=False` race is covered by an authoritative
      action-time probe/fail-closed test, matching both manual reapers.
- [x] Tests that specifically exercise the Phase 2 critical section for both
      manual reapers and the automatic finished-session sweep: assert the final
      classification/liveness read and `_reap_worktree` happen while
      continuously holding `FinalizeLock`, and that a racing record mutation
      is fenced or detected before removal. Exercise record-lock contention
      from a separate process and prove sidecar-lock timeout fails closed
      rather than degrading to in-process-only exclusion. Assert every
      participant acquires locks in the declared order.
- [x] Every existing regression test from PR #2635
      (`test_tracking_override.py`, `test_prune.py`) still passes unchanged
      or is updated to call through the new consolidated function without
      losing coverage.

### Phase 5 — Documentation

- [x] Update the `worktree` skill's Cleanup Procedure / dirty-worktree
      section (added in #2635) to describe the **unified** guarantee — batch
      cleanup, single-item cleanup (non-forced), and automatic finished-session
      cleanup revalidate the complete safety decision through the cleanup
      handoff, while `--force` remains the documented, narrower,
      individually-verified exception — so a future reader doesn't have to
      reverse-engineer this from several PRs' diffs.
- [x] Document the known residual gap
      ([#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649))
      in that same skill section: a `finalized`-status record that gains
      genuinely new WIP/conversation content after finalize is not yet
      caught by this effort's revalidation, because
      `_apply_tracking_override` masks it to `COMPLETED` before
      `cleanup_disposition` runs. State plainly that this is a known,
      tracked limitation, not an oversight the reader needs to
      rediscover.

## Validation Plan

- [x] `test-supervisor -- python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees`
      (or this repo's equivalent bounded test runner) passes in full, with no
      pre-existing-failure caveats beyond ones independently confirmed
      unrelated (as PR #2635 did for `test_knowledge_plugins.py`). **Result:**
      `606 passed, 1 failed` where the lone failure remains the pre-existing,
      unrelated `test_controller_relations.py::test_controller_metadata_is_additive_to_json_surfaces`
      `_all_tracking_dirs` miss already tracked as #2647.
- [x] Every named test enumerated in Phase 4 exists, is named for the
      specific signal/reaper/mode it covers (no bundled test standing in for
      several transitions), includes the authoritative action-time mux
      fallback, automatic reaper, idle-grace refresh, cross-process fence, and
      lock ordering, fails on the pre-effort code, and passes after; the
      finalized-status WIP/conversation variants are pinned explicitly at each
      reaper surface as the known #2649 limitation rather than being left
      implicit.
- [x] `tools/check-version-consistency.py` and `tools/check-version-bump.py`
      pass on the implementation PR.
- [x] Manual smoke check (documented in the Journal, not just asserted): a
      real worktree finalized, then edited, then fed through **both**
      `cleanup --clean` and `cleanup --worktree-id <id>` (non-forced) is
      preserved by both, with a clear skip reason printed; the same worktree
      fed through `cleanup --worktree-id <id> --force` is removed, confirming
      the forced escape hatch still works as documented.

## Proposal

_Pending — this README is the proposal; submitted as PR #2641 per the repo's
effort review-gate. This repo has no auto-merge label (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):
the submitter gives Copilot's advisory review a bounded ~5-minute window per
round, addresses what genuinely lands in that window, and then squash-merges
manually with `pr-merge ... --now` regardless of whether a further review has
posted — there is no required approval to wait for. Investigation work in
Phase 1 that is purely read-only (no code changes) may begin in parallel with
review if useful, but no consolidation/wiring changes land before the plan
clears review._

## Journal

### 2026-09-14 — Kickoff

- Effort created following the merge of PR #2635 and the operator's decision
  to defer three review findings (single-worktree revalidation gap, stale
  `active_paths` snapshot, partial dirty/active-only safety recheck) to a
  tracked follow-up rather than expand that PR further.
- Filed umbrella issue #2640 in this repo (this repo's own convention: GitHub
  issues are the discrete tracking token here — a private downstream tracker
  holds the originating cross-repo report, not canonical for this repo's
  work).
- Framed the fix as one consolidation (a single canonical revalidation
  function used by both `cmd_cleanup`'s batch loop and `reap_one`) rather
  than three independent patches, since the root cause of gap #1 is
  precisely that two call sites reimplement the same check-then-act shape
  and only one got fixed.

### 2026-09-14 — Review round 1

- Public-safe participant identity: replaced a private machine identity in
  Participants/Coordination and genericized the cross-repo tracker reference
  (Context + Journal) to avoid naming private infrastructure in this public
  effort.
- Added the `GONE`/branch-merge caller-owned gate (excluded by
  `cleanup_disposition` itself, currently proven pre-lock by both callers)
  as an explicit Phase 2 design requirement and Phase 4 regression case.

### 2026-09-14 — Review round 2

- Phase 2's return contract now requires the revalidator's fresh record and
  classification to be what `_reap_worktree` actually acts on, not just an
  informational disposition alongside the stale pre-lock objects.
- Split the forced (`reap_one --force`) and non-forced contracts explicitly
  throughout Phases 1/2/3/4 and the Validation Plan's manual smoke check —
  `--force` remains the documented, narrower, individually-verified
  exception (active-session rejection only); it is not silently absorbed
  into the full consolidated revalidation.
- Rewrote Phase 4 and the Validation Plan as a named signal × reaper × mode
  matrix instead of four bundled scenario bullets, so no implementation can
  claim completion by testing one representative per bundle.
- Added the `claimant_alive` cross-machine-probe signal to Phase 1's
  inventory and Phase 2's design (explicit bounded-timeout / fail-closed
  policy required) — flagged by the reviewer as a "previously missed"
  finding in code unchanged since the prior round, but a genuine gap in the
  plan's own signal inventory.

### 2026-09-14 — Review round 3

- Named the fundamental limit explicitly rather than leaving it implicit:
  "revalidate right before the reap" does not make check-and-delete
  indivisible. `FinalizeLock` only serializes this tool's own instances
  against each other; an external edit, session attach, or claim write can
  still land in the gap between the final fresh read and the delete
  syscall. Phase 2 now requires a stated decision — shrink the window to a
  single held critical section (documenting the residual OS-level gap as
  out of scope) or adopt further fencing (a lease/generation token, a
  transient read-only flip) — rather than implying the race closes to zero.
- The forced (`reap_one --force`) path's active-session rejection must
  itself refresh liveness under the lock, not reuse the pre-lock
  `active_paths` snapshot — otherwise `--force` can still terminate a
  session that attached *after* the scan, which is exactly the race the
  non-forced path is being fixed to avoid. Added as its own Phase 2 design
  point and Phase 4 test (distinct from "forced still rejects an
  already-active session," which was already covered).

### 2026-09-14 — Review round 4 (final planning round)

- A **third** ordinary reaper, `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`, was
  identified with the same stale check-to-delete shape as the two originally
  scoped — added to Phase 1/3's inventory and call-site list; "two call
  sites" throughout this document means three.
- `cleanup_disposition`'s finalized-shortcut ordering bug (fixed for `dirty`
  in #2635) still applies to `WIP`/`conversation-only` — "re-run
  `cleanup_disposition`" alone does not close those two signals; Phase 2 now
  requires the ordering fix (or an equivalent pre-gate) explicitly.
- `_build_active_paths` has its own stale-cache fallback (a cached
  `mux_live=False` is trusted without a `has_mux_session` cross-check) —
  independent of when the function is called. Phase 2 now requires fixing
  this fallback or using a different authoritative probe.
- Corrected Option 1's claim: holding `FinalizeLock` throughout the critical
  section only fences this tool's own finalization/cleanup instances, not
  its own session-registration/claim-mutation writers (which use a
  per-record lock). Phase 2 now requires either those writers to also honor
  a shared lock (with an explicit lock order) or a target-record lock/CAS,
  in addition to the previously-noted true-external-fencing scope decision.
- Linked the effort to the two standing statements it makes concrete —
  `visions/plugins/agent-worktrees/README.md`'s `contribution-aware-lifecycle`
  ("prove content safe before cleanup") and
  `docs/patterns/ephemeral-process-reaping.md`'s "corroborate before acting"
  — replacing the initial "Vision: none."
- Corrected the Proposal section: this repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents a
  manual `pr-merge ... --now` flow with a bounded ~5-minute advisory-review
  window per round, not an auto-merge label. Per that policy, this effort
  plan stops chasing further review rounds here and proceeds to merge —
  remaining design refinements (if any) belong to Phase 1's investigation,
  which will re-derive and settle them against the real code rather than a
  plan document's prose.

### 2026-09-14 — Review round 4 follow-up

- Expanded Phase 4 so all three reapers explicitly cover the complete signal
  matrix, finalized-record WIP/conversation drift, and cached-negative mux
  fallback; the forced path keeps its separate liveness-only contract.
- Required non-degrading cross-process record exclusion: sidecar-lock timeout
  must fail closed (or an equivalent generation/CAS protocol must detect the
  write), with real cross-process contention coverage.
- Added action-time idle-grace revalidation for the automatic sweep so a
  post-selection resume cannot be hidden merely because no session remains
  live at the final check.

### 2026-09-14 — Phase 1: investigation findings

Read-only pass over the real code (no changes yet); confirms the plan's
findings against current line numbers and settles the open questions Phase 1
posed. Full detail folded into Phase 1's checkboxes above; summarized here:

- **Signal inventory settled.** Every `cleanup_disposition` input
  (`prune.py:253`) is cheap-local — `info.state`/`info.dirty` from a fresh
  `git_ops.classify_worktree(fetch=False, ...)`, `rec.status`/held
  claims/follow-ups from a fresh `tracking.load_record`, `turn_count` from
  `sessions.scan_sessions_fast`, and `default_paired_sibling_final`
  (`prune.py:672`, confirmed no I/O) — **except** `claimant_alive`
  (`claimant.py:216`), which is cheap only same-machine and is a bounded
  (`_REMOTE_TIMEOUT = 8.0`, `claimant.py:44`) SSH round-trip cross-machine.
  PR state must stay scan-time-only (network reconcile, not re-derivable
  under the lock by design).
- **`claimant_alive`'s bounded/fail-closed policy already exists** — the
  tri-state contract (`True`/`False`/`None`) already treats `None`
  (unconfirmed/timeout) as "spare, don't reap" (`prune.py:135`, `assess()`).
  Phase 2's real design question isn't inventing a policy; it's whether the
  consolidated revalidation accepts up to 8 s of held-lock SSH latency per
  candidate, since today only `reap_one`'s pre-lock `cleanup_disposition`
  call pays that cost, not any current under-lock check.
- **`_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup` vs. `active_paths` are independent
  signals, not the same one read twice.** The former (`__main__.py:377`)
  reads only record fields (`session_backend_opaque`,
  `execution_leg_opaque`, `tracking.derive_execution_leg(...).state`) for
  **hosted**/cloud-backend sessions; the latter (`_build_active_paths`,
  `__main__.py:388`) covers local lock-file sessions, batched mux/tmux,
  cached `mux_live`/`bound_live` hints, and bridge-lock liveness. The
  consolidated function needs both, not a merge.
- **`reap_one`'s exact shape confirmed** (`__main__.py:13506`): the initial
  ACTIVE check (`__main__.py:13580`) runs pre-lock against the pre-lock
  `active_paths` built at `__main__.py:13558`, and is shared by forced and
  non-forced. Non-forced additionally runs `cleanup_disposition` pre-lock
  (`__main__.py:13612`); under the lock (`__main__.py:13631`) it re-checks
  only `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup(latest)` (`__main__.py:13641`) — no
  fresh git reclassification, `active_paths`, `claimant_alive`, held-claims,
  follow-up, or branch-merge recheck. This is gap #1 exactly as scoped: zero
  revalidation of the disposition itself. Forced mode skips
  `cleanup_disposition` (`__main__.py:13595`) but shares the same pre-lock
  ACTIVE check and the same fresh under-lock `_hosted_session_blocks_cleanup`
  check — so `--force` bypasses only the disposition, matching the
  documented contract, but its shared ACTIVE check is still stale
  pre-lock `active_paths`, confirming the forced-attach-after-scan gap
  Phase 2/4 already call out.
- **Additionally confirmed while tracing the above** (not new findings —
  cross-checking the plan's Context section against real line numbers):
  `_revalidate_before_reap` (`__main__.py:15400`, called from `cmd_cleanup`
  at `__main__.py:15646`) only re-checks ACTIVE/DIRTY, is handed the
  `active_paths` snapshot built pre-lock at `__main__.py:15483` (never
  rebuilt under the lock), and `cleanup_disposition`'s finalized-shortcut
  (`prune.py`, `rec.status == "finalized" or info.state == COMPLETED`) runs
  before its `WIP`/`empty`/`conversation-only` branches, reproducing the
  #2635-class ordering bug for those two signals. `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`
  (`__main__.py:14690`) builds its entire candidate set — including its
  `cleanup_disposition` call — in a read-only Pass 1 before ever acquiring
  `FinalizeLock` (`__main__.py:14819`), then reaps every candidate in Pass 2
  with **no revalidation at all**, the starkest instance of the same race.
  `_build_active_paths`'s stale-cache fallback (`__main__.py:415`-`430`) is
  confirmed: when the batched mux query is unavailable, a fresh
  (`_fresh_mux_live_hint` within its 600 s TTL) but cached `False` is
  trusted outright — the `has_mux_session` fallback probe only runs when
  the hint is `None` (absent/stale), not when it is a confirmed-fresh
  `False`.

Phase 1 complete. Proceeding to Phase 2's design in a follow-on session/PR
per the plan's own sequencing (no consolidation/wiring changes land before
the design is settled).

### 2026-09-14 — Phase 2: design settled

Design-only (no wiring changes yet — Phase 3 lands those). Concrete
decisions folded into Phase 2's checkboxes above; summarized here:

- New function `_revalidate_cleanup_safety(wt_id, *, repo, force=False) ->
  RevalidationResult`, called with only an id so it can't accidentally
  consume stale caller state; returns the fresh `record`/`info` alongside
  the disposition so every reaper acts on what was actually revalidated,
  not the pre-lock objects.
- Two bugs get fixed **in their owning function**, benefiting every caller,
  not just the new revalidator: (1) `cleanup_disposition`'s `WIP`/
  `empty`/`conversation-only` branches move ahead of the
  finalized/COMPLETED shortcut, mirroring #2635's `dirty` fix; (2)
  `_build_active_paths`'s stale-cache fallback always falls through to
  `has_mux_session` when the batched mux query is unavailable, regardless
  of a fresh cached `False` hint.
- `claimant_alive`'s existing bounded (8 s)/fail-closed tri-state policy is
  kept as-is and paid fresh under the lock for the non-forced path — no new
  policy needed, cost accepted rather than engineered around.
- Forced vs. non-forced are two named contracts sharing one liveness-read
  code path (fixing the forced-path's stale-`active_paths` gap) but
  diverging on whether `cleanup_disposition` runs at all — force never
  re-checks dirty/WIP/claims/follow-ups/branch-merge, only liveness.
- The residual-TOCTOU question resolves to **Option 1(b)**: the non-forced
  contract holds `tracking._RecordLock(yaml_path, require_sidecar=True)`
  (fail-closed on contention) across the fresh-read-through-reap window, in
  addition to `FinalizeLock` — reusing the sidecar lock every other RMW
  writer in this codebase already takes, rather than inventing a new
  primitive or a CAS/generation token. Lock order is `FinalizeLock` then
  `_RecordLock`, verified by a Phase 4 test. A true external fence (an
  editor, a bare `git` command outside the tool) stays explicitly
  out of scope, to be documented plainly in Phase 5.

Proceeding to Phase 3 (wiring) in a follow-on PR.

### 2026-09-14 — Phase 3: wiring implemented

Implemented exactly the Phase 2 design; no design changes. Summary:

- Added `_revalidate_cleanup_safety(wt_id, *, repo, tracking_path,
  force=False, include_unused=False, include_conversations=False, reap=None)`
  returning a `RevalidationResult(cleanable, reason, bucket, record, info,
  failures, warnings, reaped)`. It reloads the record fresh from disk,
  rebuilds a single-worktree `active_paths`, re-classifies git state, and —
  non-forced only — runs the full `cleanup_disposition` and re-proves the
  `GONE`/branch-merge gate itself. When a `reap` callback is supplied and
  the decision is cleanable, it is invoked while a non-forced call still
  holds `tracking._RecordLock(require_sidecar=True)` (fail-closed on
  contention), so the fresh read and the delete are one uninterrupted,
  lock-held sequence. Forced mode shares the same liveness-read path but
  skips `cleanup_disposition` and doesn't take `_RecordLock`.
- Wired all three call sites: `cmd_cleanup`'s batch loop, `reap_one`'s
  non-forced path (forced keeps its pre-lock fast-reject UX checks but the
  authoritative decision now goes through the same function too, with
  `force=True`), and `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`'s Pass 2 — which
  also re-derives its idle-grace timestamp at reap time from fresh mux
  activity/tracking timestamps before calling the revalidator, so a resume
  between Pass 1 (candidate selection) and Pass 2 (reap) postpones removal.
- Fixed `cleanup_disposition`'s WIP/conversation-only ordering bug and
  `_build_active_paths`'s stale-negative-cache fallback in their own
  functions, per the Phase 2 decision, so every caller benefits.
- Removed `_revalidate_before_reap` entirely — one non-forced revalidation
  path now exists.
- Updated `test_auto_clean.py`'s `_sweep` test helper to mock
  `tracking.load_record`/`tracking._RecordLock` (the revalidator reloads
  fresh from disk under the lock, which the old helper didn't anticipate).
- Full `agent-worktrees` suite: 583 passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure
  (`test_controller_relations.py`'s `_all_tracking_dirs` reference, confirmed
  to fail identically on an unmodified checkout — filed as #2647, not part
  of this effort).
- Bumped `agent-worktrees` to `1.5.5-dev104` (`plugin.json`/`pyproject.toml`/
  `marketplace.json`), verified via `check-version-consistency.py`.

Phase 3 complete. Phase 4 (the full named signal × reaper × mode regression
matrix) and Phase 5 (skill docs) remain — substantial enough in their own
right (≈30 named tests) to warrant their own dedicated pass/PR(s), continuing
this effort rather than closing it here.

### 2026-09-14 — Phase 3 follow-up: residual gap found while pinning tests

While replacing the (now-removed) `_revalidate_before_reap` tests with
`TestRevalidateCleanupSafety`, a genuine, previously-unrecognized gap
surfaced: `_apply_tracking_override` masks ANY non-dirty/GONE/ACTIVE fresh
git state to `COMPLETED` for a `finalized`-status record — including WIP
and UNUSED-with-turns — **before** `cleanup_disposition` ever runs. It
does this deliberately, to correct a real squash-merge artifact (a
finalized branch that still reads "ahead" of upstream even though its
content already landed), but it cannot distinguish that from genuinely
new commits/turns made *after* finalize, which present identically.

**Consequence:** the Phase 2/3 fix to `cleanup_disposition`'s WIP/
conversation-only ordering (mirroring #2635's `dirty` fix) is real and
correct for records whose git state isn't first collapsed by the
override — but for a `finalized`-status record specifically, the
override already converts WIP/conversation-only to COMPLETED
independently of, and prior to, that ordering fix, so the fix alone does
not close the finalized-record case the original Context section
described. This was not caught during Phase 1/2 because those phases
traced `cleanup_disposition`'s own internal ordering without also tracing
what `_apply_tracking_override` does to `info.state` immediately
beforehand.

Filed as [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649),
with a pinning test (`test_finalized_status_currently_masks_new_wip_gap`)
documenting today's actual (unsafe) behavior. Not fixed in this effort's
Phase 3 PR — a real fix needs a way to distinguish "already-known-squashed
WIP at finalize time" from "new WIP since finalize" (e.g. a branch-tip
fingerprint recorded at finalize time, or relying on `classify_worktree`'s
own squash-merge-aware COMPLETED detection instead of blanket-masking by
status), which is a distinct design question from anything Phase 2
already decided. Left as a tracked follow-up rather than silently folded
in or dropped.

### 2026-09-14 — Phase 4/5 coverage and docs

- Added a reusable reaper-harness test helper plus two new wiring-level test
  modules: one drives the actual `cmd_cleanup` and `reap_one()` call sites,
  the other drives `sweep_finished_session_worktrees()`. Together they cover
  the Phase 4 matrix's per-reaper/per-mode signals: dirty, active, WIP,
  conversation-only, held-claim, follow-up, branch-unmerged/GONE,
  claimant-liveness-unknown, mux cached-negative fallback, forced-mode escape
  hatch behavior, and the sweep's idle-grace refresh.
- Added explicit critical-section coverage for all three reapers: the
  action-time classification/session-liveness read and `_reap_worktree` now
  have dedicated tests asserting they run while `FinalizeLock` remains held,
  that the non-forced path keeps `_RecordLock(require_sidecar=True)` held
  through the reap, and that a peer mutation attempt is fenced plus
  cross-process sidecar contention fails closed instead of degrading to
  in-process-only exclusion.
- Extended the residual [#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649)
  pinning from the direct `_revalidate_cleanup_safety` test to the actual
  reaper call sites: batch cleanup, single-item cleanup, and the automatic
  sweep now each carry explicit "finalized status currently masks new WIP /
  conversation" tests so the known unsafe behavior is visible at the exact
  user-facing surfaces it still affects.
- Updated the `worktree` skill's Cleanup Procedure to describe the unified
  non-forced guarantee (all three reapers revalidate the full safety decision
  immediately before removal; `--force` still only refreshes liveness) and to
  document #2649 plainly as a known tracked limitation rather than a missing
  doc gap.

### 2026-09-14 — Validation pass

- Full bounded plugin validation after the Phase 4/5 changes:
  `python3 tools/run-plugin-tests.py agent-worktrees` now reports
  **`606 passed, 1 failed`**. The one failure is unchanged from the pre-effort
  baseline — `tests/test_controller_relations.py::test_controller_metadata_is_additive_to_json_surfaces`
  still expects `agent_worktrees.__main__._all_tracking_dirs`, the unrelated
  tracked issue [#2647](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2647).
  No new failures surfaced.
- Version gates both pass after bumping `agent-worktrees` to
  `1.5.5-dev105` / marketplace `1.7.7-dev95`:
  `python3 tools/check-version-consistency.py` and
  `python3 tools/check-version-bump.py`.
- Manual smoke (temporary real git repo + real git worktree, no mocked
  classification): marked the tracking record `finalized`, edited
  `tracked.txt`, then exercised the actual cleanup surfaces. Results:
  `cleanup --clean` preserved the worktree and reported
  `1 with uncommitted changes -- not eligible for cleanup`; the single-item
  `cleanup --worktree-id wt1` preserved it and printed
  `wt1: skipped -- 1 uncommitted change(s)`; the same single-item path with
  `--force` removed the worktree and retired the tracking YAML
  (`wt1: removed`).

### 2026-09-14 — Closing the effort

All five phases are merged to `main` (PRs #2643, #2644, #2645, #2648, #2652).
Every Plan and Validation Plan checkbox is resolved; the one known residual
gap ([#2649](https://github.com/ThomasMichon/copilot-extensions/issues/2649))
is deliberately left open and tracked, not silently folded in, per the
Phase 3/4 Journal entries above. `cleanup --clean`, `cleanup --worktree-id`
(forced and non-forced), and the automatic `sweep_finished_session_worktrees`
now all revalidate the complete safety decision through one canonical
function immediately before deletion, closing the three original TOCTOU gaps
and the four review findings that sharpened them. Durable truth (the unified
guarantee and the #2649 limitation) is promoted into the `worktree` skill's
Cleanup Procedure. Status set to Done; archiving now.
