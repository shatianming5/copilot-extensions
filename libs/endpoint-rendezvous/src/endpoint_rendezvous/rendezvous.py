"""Rendezvous (port-mapping) files for discoverable, collision-free local endpoints.

A *service-bearing* Copilot CLI plugin needs its clients -- its own CLI, sibling
plugins, and agents on the box -- to reach it without hardcoding a fixed loopback
TCP port. Pinning a port collides with siblings, with the ``127.0.0.1`` a Windows
host shares with its WSL guest, and with OS reservations (Hyper-V/WinNAT excluded
ranges) that hold an address with no listener.

The **rendezvous file** is the discovery seam: a small JSON file a service writes
when it binds and every client reads to find it -- the "port-mapping file"
convention. It lets a service move to an OS-native endpoint (a Unix socket / named
pipe) or an OS-assigned ephemeral port while clients keep resolving it with no
edit.

On-disk format (``<runtime_dir>/endpoint.json``), matching
``docs/patterns/local-endpoint-discovery.md``::

    {
      "schema": 1,
      "transport": "unix" | "pipe" | "tcp",
      "endpoint": "/home/u/.agent-x/run/x.sock" | "\\\\.\\pipe\\agent-x" | "127.0.0.1:52731",
      "pid": 48213,
      "started_at": "2026-07-16T22:41:09Z"
    }

The client-side :func:`resolve` implements the **cutover fallback ladder** an
in-place migration off a fixed port needs: an explicit override, then the
rendezvous file, then a legacy fixed constant. A not-yet-migrated service (no
file) is still reached via the legacy default; a migrated one is discovered.

Pure standard library; no runtime dependencies.
